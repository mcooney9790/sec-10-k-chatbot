      "text": " Item 1. Business \n\nCSX Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations. CSX and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the long-term economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. In addition, freight railroads provide the most economical and environmentally efficient means to transport goods over land. \n\nCSX Transportation, Inc. \n\nCSX&#8217;s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (&#8220;CSXT&#8221;), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 20,000 route-mile rail network and serves major population centers in 26 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. This access allows the Company to meet the dynamic transportation needs of manufacturers, industrial producers, the automotive industry, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers, and energy producers. The Company&#8217;s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections with other Class I railroads and more than 240 short-line and regional railroads. On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (&#8220;Pan Am&#8221;) which is the parent company of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This acquisition expands CSXT&#8217;s reach in the Northeastern United States. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations . \n\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities. Substantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations. \n\nOther Entities \n\nIn addition to CSXT, the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers, Inc. (\"Quality Carriers\"), CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (&#8220;CSX Intermodal Terminals&#8221;), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (&#8220;TDSI&#8221;), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (&#8220;Transflo&#8221;), CSX Technology, Inc. (&#8220;CSX Technology&#8221;) and other subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers, the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals truck transportation in North America. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations . CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States, and also provides drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks. The biggest Transflo markets are chemicals and agriculture, which includes shipments of plastics and ethanol. CSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company. \n\nOperating Model \n\nThe Company is focused on developing and strictly maintaining a scheduled service plan with an emphasis on improving customer service, optimizing assets and increasing employee engagement. When this operating model is executed effectively, the Company competes for an increased share of the U.S. freight market. Further, this model leads to reduced costs and strong free cash flow generation. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.3 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nLines of Business \n\nDuring 2022, the Company's services generated $14.9 billion of revenue and served four primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal, coal and trucking. \n\n&#8226; The merchandise business shipped 2.6 million carloads (41% of volume) and generated $8.2 billion in revenue (55% of revenue) in 2022. The Company&#8217;s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets: chemicals, agricultural and food products, minerals, automotive, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers. \n\n&#8226; The intermodal business shipped 3.0 million units (48% of volume) and generated $2.3 billion in revenue (16% of revenue) in 2022. The intermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of trucks and offers a cost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30 terminals, the intermodal business serves all major markets east of the Mississippi River and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments. \n\n&#8226; The coal business shipped 697 thousand carloads (11% of volume) and generated $2.4 billion in revenue (16% of revenue) in 2022. The Company transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and industrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Most of the export coal the Company transports is used for steelmaking, while the majority of domestic coal the Company ships is used for electricity generation. \n\n&#8226; The trucking business generated $966 million, or 7%, of revenue in 2022. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers, which was acquired by CSX effective July 1, 2021. \n\nOther revenue accounted for 6% of the Company&#8217;s total revenue in 2022. This category includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue from regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad. \n\nCSX's Committed Workforce \n\nMost of the Company&#8217;s employees provide or support transportation services. The Company had more than 22,500 employees as of December 2022, which includes approximately 17,100 employees that are members of a rail labor union. As of December 2, 2022, all 12 rail unions at CSX that participated in national bargaining were covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that will remain in effect through December 31, 2024. In the face of supply chain disruption and a tight labor market, CSX continues to focus on ensuring the hiring pipeline for frontline railroaders is adequate to meet customer needs and has implemented new recruiting and staffing measures. \n\nCSX prioritizes workplace safety for employees and is committed to continued improvement through enhanced processes, training, technology, communication, and continuous collaboration with customers and peers across the railroad industry. Training programs and processes are focused on injury and accident prevention as well as emergency preparedness. The attainment of key safety targets is a component of management's annual incentive program. The FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index, a measure of the number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours, was 0.96 in both 2022 and 2021, remaining flat year over year. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.4 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nThe Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with oversight of CSX's workforce. The Company is committed to developing a culture that promotes workforce diversity and inclusion and encourages ethical behavior. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 21% of CSX's overall workforce and 36% of management was diverse, calculated as the percentage of males of color and all females. In 2022, CSX was recognized as a &#8220;Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion&#8221; by Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities for a fourth consecutive year after receiving a top score on their disability equality index. The CSX Code of Ethics serves as a guiding standard for ethical behavior and covers many types of matters, including discrimination and harassment as well as safety. Annually, all management employees are required, and union employees are highly encouraged, to complete ethics training. \n\nCompany History \n\nA leader in freight rail transportation for nearly 200 years, the Company&#8217;s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (&#8220;B&#38;O&#8221;), the nation&#8217;s first common carrier, was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation. Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&#38;O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors. \n\nCSX Corporation was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company&#8217;s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc. (\"Conrail\") allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the Southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network, which now includes the network acquired from Pan Am, allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company&#8217;s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. \n\nCSXT&#8217;s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company&#8217;s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company&#8217;s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.5 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nRegulatory Environment \n\nThe Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the United States and Canada. In the U.S., the railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (&#8220;STB&#8221;), the Federal Railroad Administration (&#8220;FRA&#8221;), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the Company's properties and operations. \n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (&#8220;TSA&#8221;), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications. In Canada, the railroad operations conducted by the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency. \n\nAlthough the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated the U.S. rail industry, the STB has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers. The STB regulates routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, rates for non-exempt traffic, acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, among other railroad activities. Any new rules from the STB regarding, among other things, competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. For further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors . \n\nFinancial Information \n\nInformation regarding the Company's results of operations and financial position can be found in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. \n\nOther Information \n\nCSX makes available on its website www.csx.com , free of charge, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company has posted its code of ethics on its website, which is also available to any shareholder who requests it. This Form 10-K and other SEC filings made by CSX are also accessible through the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov . \n\n&#160; \n\nCSX has included the certifications of its Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and the Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;) required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;) as Exhibit 31, as well as Section 906 of the Act as Exhibit 32 to this Form 10-K report. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor additional information concerning business conducted by the Company during 2022, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.6 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\n"

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nRegulatory, Legislative and Legal \n\nNew legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices. \n\nLegislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs, including income taxes, and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nGovernment regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. \n\nThe Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. \n\nCSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. \n\nA train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate. \n\nCSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.7 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. \n\nAs part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates. \n\nOperational, Safety and Business Disruption \n\nAn epidemic or pandemic and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the Company's business. \n\nThe Company could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. During a health crisis, policies and initiatives may be instituted by the public and private sector to reduce transmission, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions. These policies or initiatives could adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the Company transports, including import and export volume. \n\nIn addition, initiatives to reduce transmission could result in supply chain disruptions, which could impact volumes and make it more difficult for the Company to serve its customers. Moreover, operations are negatively affected when a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. To the extent a public health crisis adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. \n\nThe Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. \n\nThe Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The security, stability and availability of the Company&#8217;s and its key third-party vendors&#8217; technology systems are critical to its ability to operate safely and effectively and to compete within the transportation industry. A successful data breach, cyber-attack, or the occurrence of any similar incident that impacts the Company&#8217;s or its key third-party vendors&#8217; information technology systems could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), process failure, or other operational difficulties. A disruption or compromise of the Company&#8217;s information technology systems, even for short periods of time, and any resulting theft or compromise of Company confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business or reputation, create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure and have a material adverse impact on CSX&#8217;s business, financial condition or operations. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.8 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nThe Company, its third-party vendors and other companies in the rail and transportation industries have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. These incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, human error, fraud, or other modes of attack or disruption. Attacks of these nature are increasing in frequency, levels of persistence, intensity and sophistication. Further, the Company may be at increased risk of a cyber-attack as a result of being a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents. A public health crisis could also increase the risk that the Company or its third-party vendors may experience cybersecurity incidents as a result of employees, third-party vendors and other third parties with which they interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments. \n\nDespite the Company&#8217;s efforts to protect its information technology systems, it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately remediate any such incident. While CSX&#8217;s security protocols have detected attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s information technology systems, none of such attempts have resulted in any material breach of or disruption to the Company&#8217;s systems. For example, CSX has experienced distributed denial of service attacks that have resulted in brief system disruptions, but none have resulted in access to CSX systems. Additionally, despite routine security assessment of the Company&#8217;s key third-party vendors, some vendors have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, but none of such attacks have had a material adverse impact on CSX&#8217;s business or operations. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, CSX may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party vendors as they relate to the information CSX shares with them. \n\nAdditionally, if CSX is unable to acquire, develop or implement new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service. \n\nNetwork or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service, operating efficiency or volume of shipments. \n\nCSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) locomotive or crew shortages; (ii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities, customer facilities or other railroads; (iii) unpredictable increases in demand; (iv) extreme weather conditions; (v) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes; (vi) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (vii) impacts from changes in network capacity or structure; or (viii) increased passenger activities, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. \n\nFuture acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations. \n\nTerrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.9 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nFurthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. \n\nSevere weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage. \n\nThe Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, hurricanes, fires and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Hurricanes as well as storm and flooding events have impacted the Company's network in the past, leading to interrupted service and damage to track and equipment. Changes in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. \n\nInsurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations. \n\nCompetitive, Economic and Financial \n\nThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers. \n\nThe Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates. \n\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight. \n\nA decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products or continues to experience the impacts of inflation, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.10 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nChanging dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability. \n\nOver time, changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets, including the impacts of regulation and alternative fuel sources, have resulted in lower energy production from coal-fired power plants in CSX's service territory. Changes in natural gas prices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity, could impact future power generation at coal-fired plants, which would affect the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. \n\nWeaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s access to capital. \n\nThe Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company&#8217;s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company&#8217;s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing. \n\nAvailability of Critical Supplies and Labor \n\nThe unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand. \n\nMarketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. \n\nDisruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs. \n\nThe capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, freight cars and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted. \n\nFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. \n\nMost of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.11 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nClimate Change and Environmental \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change. \n\nThere is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. \n\nClimate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles. Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, including any proposed or implemented under the Biden administration, could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs. \n\nThe Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company. \n\nThe Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. \n\n"

These categories and the geography of the network are described below. \n\nTrack and Infrastructure \n\nServing 26 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern markets of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago. \n\nCSXT&#8217;s track structure includes mainline track, connecting terminals and yards, track within terminals and switching yards, sidings used for passing trains, track connecting CSXT's track to customer locations and turnouts that divert trains from one track to another. Total track miles, which reflect the size of CSXT&#8217;s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads, are greater than CSXT&#8217;s approximately 20,000 route miles. At December 2022, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Track &#160; Miles Single Mainline Track 19,879 Other Mainline Track 5,662 Terminals and Switching Yards 9,308 Passing Sidings and Turnouts 901 Total 35,750 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as points of connectivity between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received, classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains, or arrive and are delivered to the customer. The Company&#8217;s largest yards and terminals based on 2022 volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below. \n\n##TABLE_START Yards and Terminals Annual Volume Waycross, GA 931,488 Bedford Park Intermodal Terminal (Chicago) 886,636 Selkirk, NY 636,750 Nashville, TN 627,868 Cincinnati, OH 622,906 Avon, IN (Indianapolis) 574,775 Walbridge, OH (Toledo) 372,880 Fairburn, GA Intermodal Terminal (Atlanta) 358,416 Louisville, KY 352,029 Chicago 59th St. Intermodal Terminal 308,421 ##TABLE_END\n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.13 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nNetwork Geography \n\nCSXT&#8217;s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors that are defined geographically and by commodity flows below. \n\nInterstate 90 (I-90) Corridor &#8211; This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the &#8220;waterlevel route,&#8221; has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal, automotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company&#8217;s major rail markets &#8211; merchandise, intermodal and coal. \n\nInterstate 95 (I-95) Corridor &#8211; The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia and provides access to major eastern ports. \n\nSoutheastern Corridor &#8211; This critical part of the network runs between CSXT&#8217;s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast. \n\nCoal Network &#160; &#8211; The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT&#8217;s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Most of the export coal the Company transports is used for steelmaking, while the majority of domestic coal the Company ships is used for electricity generation. \n\nSee the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. Also included on the map, \"CSX Operating Agreement\" indicates areas within which CSX can operate through trackage rights beyond the CSX network. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.14 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nCSX Rail Network \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.15 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nLocomotives \n\nAs of December 2022, CSXT owns or long-term leases more than 3,600 locomotives. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are used primarily to pull trains while switching locomotives are used in yards. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. Of owned locomotives, approximately 68% were in active service as of December 31, 2022, and the remainder were in storage to be utilized as needed. Storing locomotives and equipment allows the Company to quickly adjust its active fleet based on demand and other factors while avoiding delays due to supply limitations or excessive lead times to acquire additional equipment. As of December 2022, CSXT&#8217;s fleet of owned or long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following types: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Locomotives % Average Age \n\n(years) \n\nFreight 3,194 89 % 23 Switching 237 6 % 45 Auxiliary Units 177 5 % 29 Total locomotives 3,608 &#160; 100 % 25 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nEquipment \n\nThe Company owns or long-term leases rail equipment, including several types of freight cars and intermodal containers. Of total owned and long-term leased equipment, approximately 91% was in active service as of December 31, 2022, and the remainder were in storage to be utilized as needed. As of December 2022, the Company&#8217;s owned and long-term leased equipment consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START Equipment Number of Units % Gondolas 18,613 40 % Multi-level Flat Cars 10,736 23 % Open-top Hoppers 6,403 14 % Covered Hoppers 6,366 13 % Box Cars 3,745 8 % Flat Cars 565 1 % Other Cars 596 1 % Subtotal Freight Cars 47,024 100 % Containers 19,405 Total Equipment 66,429 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt any time, approximately two-thirds of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by the Company. Examples of these include railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shipper&#8217;s service), multi-level railcars used to transport automobiles (which are shared between railroads) and double-stack railcars, or well cars (which are industry pooled), that allow for two intermodal containers to be loaded one above the other. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.16 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART I \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenue-generating equipment, either owned or long-term leased, primarily consists of freight cars and containers as described below. \n\n&#160; \n\nGondolas &#8211; Support CSXT&#8217;s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel. \n\nMulti-level flat cars &#8211; Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles. \n\nCovered hoppers &#8211; Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and industrial sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers. \n\nOpen-top hoppers &#8211; Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel that are resistant to weather conditions. \n\nBox cars &#8211; Include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine. \n\nFlat cars &#8211; Used for shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood. \n\nOther cars &#8211; Primarily leased refrigerator cars and slab steel cars. \n\nContainers &#8211; Weather-proof boxes used for bulk shipment of freight, primarily in intermodal service. \n\n"

Export coal decreased due to lower shipments of thermal coal, partially driven by reduced capacity at Curtis Bay coal pier due to an outage at a portion of the facility. The facility is now back at full capacity. \n\nTrucking Revenue \n\nTrucking revenue increased $556 million versus prior year due to the inclusion of Quality Carriers&#8217; results and higher fuel surcharge. \n\nOther Revenue \n\nOther revenue was $164 million higher than prior year driven by increases in revenue for intermodal storage and equipment usage, increases in demurrage and higher affiliate revenue. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.26 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nExpense \n\nIn 2022, total expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 27%, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below. \n\n&#160; \n\nLabor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $311 million due to the following items: \n\n&#8226; The impacts of agreements reached with labor unions as well as inflation totaled $199 million. Of the total, $32 million relates to labor and benefits in prior years. \n\n&#8226; The inclusion of Quality Carriers' operations for the full year in 2022 versus a portion of the year in 2021 resulted in increased costs of $74 million. \n\n&#8226; Incentive compensation costs decreased $29 million primarily due to the impact of accelerated expense for eligible employees in the prior year. \n\n&#8226; Other costs increased $67 million primarily due to hiring and retention costs, the inclusion of Pan Am's operations and other non-significant items. \n\nPurchased Services and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total purchased services and other expenses increased $550 million driven by the following: \n\n&#8226; The inclusion of Quality Carriers' operations for the full year in 2022 versus a portion of the year in 2021 drove $280 million of additional costs. \n\n&#8226; Higher operating support costs, primarily due to inflation, higher intermodal terminal costs and an increased active locomotive fleet, drove an increase of $182 million. \n\n&#8226; Adjustments to environmental reserves resulted in $21 million higher expense. \n\n&#8226; All other costs increased $67 million primarily due to several non-significant items including Pan Am's operations and acquisition-related costs. \n\nFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $713 million primarily due to a 66% price increase in locomotive fuel prices and the inclusion of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. \n\nDepreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $80 million primarily due to a larger net asset base, which includes Quality Carriers' assets, as well as the impacts of a 2022 equipment depreciation study. \n\nEquipment and Other Rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $32 million primarily due to increased car hire costs as well as the addition of Quality Carriers' costs. Car hire costs increased due to higher days per load and inflation, partially offset by lower volume. \n\nGains on Property Dispositions decreased to $238 million in 2022 from $454 million in 2021 primarily due to lower gains from the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Related to this transaction, CSX recognized gains of $144 million in 2022 and $349 million in 2021. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.27 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases. Interest expense increased $20 million primarily as a result of higher average debt balances, partially offset by increased capitalized interest. \n\nOther Income - Net \n\nOther Income - Net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income increased $54 million primarily due to higher interest income, driven by increased rates, and an increase in net pension benefit credits during 2022. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome Tax Expense increased $78 million primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes, partially offset by favorable adjustments to deferred state taxes and favorable state legislative changes. \n\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Diluted Share \n\nNet Earnings increased $385 million to $4.2 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.27 to $1.95, due to the factors mentioned above. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.28 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nNON-GAAP MEASURES (Unaudited) \n\nCSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX&#8217;s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nManagement believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company&#8217;s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds from property dispositions. This measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow before dividends decreased $101 million year-over-year to $3.7 billion primarily due to higher property additions and lower proceeds and advances from property dispositions, mostly attributable to the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia. These decreases were partially offset by higher net cash provided by operating activities. \n\nThe following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure). \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended &#160; 2022 2021 (Dollars in Millions) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 5,619 &#160; $ 5,099 &#160; Property Additions (2,133) (1,791) Proceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions 246 529 \n\nOther Investing Activities (a) \n\nn/a (4) Free Cash Flow, before Dividends (Non-GAAP) $ 3,732 $ 3,833 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Effective first quarter 2022, the results of other investing activities are no longer included in free cash flow. Prior year has not been restated as the change is immaterial. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.29 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nOPERATING STATISTICS (Estimated) \n\nCertain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle. The methodology for calculating train velocity, dwell, cars online and trip plan performance differs from that used by the Surface Transportation Board. The Company will continue to report these metrics to the Surface Transportation Board using the prescribed methodology. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Years 2022 2021 Improvement/ \n\n(Deterioration) \n\nOperations Performance \n\nTrain Velocity (Miles per hour) (a) \n\n16.1 &#160; 17.9 (10) % \n\nDwell (Hours) (a) \n\n11.3 &#160; 10.7 (6) % \n\nCars Online (a) \n\n138,074 &#160; 131,564 (5) % \n\nOn-Time Originations (a) \n\n60 &#160; % 75 % (20) % \n\nOn-Time Arrivals (a) \n\n52 &#160; % 66 % (21) % \n\nCarload Trip Plan Performance (a) \n\n64 &#160; % 69 % (7) % \n\nIntermodal Trip Plan Performance (a) \n\n90 &#160; % 87 % 3 % Fuel Efficiency 0.99 &#160; 0.96 (3) % \n\nRevenue Ton-Miles (Billions) \n\nMerchandise 126.0 &#160; 126.3 &#8212; % Coal 33.8 &#160; 35.4 (5) % Intermodal 30.0 &#160; 31.5 (5) % Total Revenue Ton-Miles 189.8 &#160; 193.2 (2) % \n\nTotal Gross Ton-Miles (Billions) \n\n375.5 &#160; 376.0 &#8212; % Safety \n\nFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index (a) \n\n0.96 &#160; 0.96 &#8212; % \n\nFRA Train Accident Rate (a) \n\n3.18 &#160; 3.22 1 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) These metrics do not include results from the network acquired from Pan Am. These metrics will be updated to include the Pan Am network results as data becomes available. \n\nKey Performance Measures Definitions: \n\nTrain Velocity - Average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). Train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation. \n\nDwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard. \n\nCars Online &#160;- Average number of active freight rail cars on lines operated by CSX, excluding rail cars that are being repaired, in storage, those that have been sold, or private cars dwelling at a customer location more than one day. \n\nOn-Time Originations - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule. \n\nOn-Time Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to within two hours of scheduled arrival. Carload Trip Plan Performance - Percent of measured cars destined for a customer that arrive at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicable). \n\nIntermodal Trip Plan Performance - Percent of measured containers destined for a customer that arrive at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicable). \n\nFuel Efficiency - Gallons of locomotive fuel per 1,000 gross ton-miles. \n\nRevenue Ton-Miles (RTM's) - The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile. \n\nGross Ton-Miles (GTM's) - The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents. \n\nFRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. \n\nFRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.30 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nThe Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. \n\nThe Company remains focused on safety, service, and controlling costs. Train velocity declined 10% relative to 2021. Dwell increased by 6% and cars online increased 5% in 2022. Compared to 2021, intermodal trip plan performance improved 3%, while carload trip plan performance decreased 7%. CSX has seen an improvement in service metrics in the last quarter of 2022 and expects that trend to continue in 2023. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, the FRA personal injury index was flat compared to prior year while the train-accident rate improved by 1%. Safety remains a top priority at CSX, and the Company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the Company operates. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nLiquidity is a company&#8217;s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company&#8217;s liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed. \n\nSignificant Cash Flows \n\nThe following charts highlight the operating, investing and financing components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2022 and 2021. \n\nIn 2022, the Company generated $5.6 billion of cash from operating activities, which was $520 million more than prior year primarily driven by higher cash-generating income, partially offset by less favorable working capital activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion, an increase in net spend of $254 million from the prior year primarily as a result of higher property additions and lower proceeds and advances from property dispositions, partially offset by decreased costs for business acquisitions. Cash used in financing activities was $3.8 billion, which represents a decrease in net spend of $343 million from the prior year mostly driven by the issuance of long-term debt as well as lower repayments of debt, partially offset by higher share repurchases. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.31 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nSources of Cash and Liquidity \n\nThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 16, 2022, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX&#8217;s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. In 2022, CSX issued $2.0 billion of long-term debt. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. \n\nCSX has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in March 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program. \n\nUses of Cash \n\nCSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. \n\nIn 2022, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended \n\nCapital Expenditures (Dollars in Millions) \n\n2022 2021 Track $ 1,000 &#160; $ 876 Bridges, Signals and Other 673 &#160; 567 Total Infrastructure 1,673 &#160; 1,443 Strategic Projects and Commercial Facilities 251 &#160; 194 Locomotives 104 &#160; 89 Freight Cars 75 &#160; 29 Regulatory (including PTC) 30 &#160; 36 Total Capital Expenditures $ 2,133 &#160; 1,791 ##TABLE_END\n\nPlanned capital investments for 2023 are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion. Of the 2023 investment, approximately 75% is expected to be used to sustain the core infrastructure and operating equipment. The remaining amounts will be used to promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives. CSX intends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations. \n\nCSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company&#8217;s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K). \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.32 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nCSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors. On February 14, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.11 per common share effective March 2023. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. \n\nMaterial Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital \n\nCSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. Further, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. \n\nTotal assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.4 billion from prior year end. The increase in total assets was primarily due to a $1.2 billion increase in net properties and a $193 million increase in investments in affiliates and other companies, partially offset by a reduction in cash of $281 million. The increase in net properties was primarily attributable to capital expenditures as well as fixed assets acquired as part of the Pan Am transaction. In addition, the increase in investments in affiliates and other companies includes the impact of the acquired interest in Pan Am Southern, LLC as well as higher values of several affiliates. See Note 17, Business Combinations , for more details on purchase accounting. \n\nTotal liabilities increased $2.3 billion from prior year end primarily due to the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt and a $186 million increase in deferred taxes due to accelerated tax depreciation and the impact of the Pan Am acquisition. These increases were partially offset by debt repayments of $186 million. Total shareholders' equity decreased $875 million from prior year end primarily driven by share repurchases of $4.7 billion and dividends paid of $852 million, partially offset by net earnings of $4.2 billion and $422 million of common stock issued to acquire Pan Am. \n\nWorking capital is considered a measure of a company&#8217;s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of $1.4 billion at December 2022 and $1.6 billion at December 2021, a decrease of $262 million. Current assets decreased primarily driven by the net decline in cash of $281 million described above, partially offset by the $165 million increase in accounts receivable. Current liabilities increased primarily due to the $167 million increase in accounts payable. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.33 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nThe Company&#8217;s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. \n\nCompleted Transactions \n\nAcquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. \n\nOn June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am. The closing price of $600 million was funded through a combination of common stock valued at $422 million and cash totaling $178 million, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. Total cash consideration paid to acquire the business includes a $30 million deposit paid in fourth quarter 2020. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations . \n\nAcquisition of Quality Carriers, Inc. \n\nOn July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers, Inc. for a purchase price of $544 million in cash. This transaction was funded by cash on hand. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations . \n\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia \n\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (&#8220;Commonwealth&#8221;) over three phases for a total of $525 million. As of December 31, 2022, all three phases are closed. Gains and proceeds in 2022 and 2021 related to this transaction are summarized in the following table. For further details, refer to Note 6, Properties . \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Gains $ 144 &#160; $ 349 Proceeds 125 &#160; 400 ##TABLE_END\n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.34 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nCredit Ratings \n\nCredit ratings reflect an independent agency&#8217;s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower&#8217;s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company&#8217;s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&#38;P and Moody&#8217;s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during 2022. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, S&#38;P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&#38;P and Moody&#8217;s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX&#8217;s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market&#8217;s demand, and thus the Company&#8217;s ability to readily issue new debt. The Company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. \n\nGuaranteed Notes Issued By CSXT \n\nIn 2007, CSXT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, issued in a registered public offering $381 million of secured equipment notes maturing in 2023. CSX Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. At CSXT&#8217;s option, CSXT may redeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. In the case of loss or destruction of any item of equipment securing the notes, if CSXT does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or destruction, CSXT will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. The guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of CSX Corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of CSX Corporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. As of December 31, 2022, the principal balance of these secured equipment notes was $139 million. \n\nIn accordance with SEC rules, including amendments adopted in 2020, CSX is not required to present separate condensed consolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes. Additionally, presentation of combined summary financial information regarding subsidiary issuers and guarantors is not required because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.35 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nCSX is party to contractual arrangements that obligate the Company to make future cash payments. These obligations impact the Company&#8217;s liquidity and capital resource needs. The Company&#8217;s contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, purchase commitments, leases, other-post employment benefits and agreements with Conrail. \n\n&#8226; As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities. See Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements , for additional information related to future debt payments. Future interest payments associated with outstanding debt total $14.8 billion, with $771 million payable in 2023. \n\n&#8226; Purchase commitments consist of CSX&#8217;s long-term locomotive maintenance program and other commitments to purchase technology, communications, railcar maintenance and other services. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies , for additional information about future payments related to purchase commitments. \n\n&#8226; Capital expenditures include investments related to public-private partnerships. These partnership investments are typically for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to CSX through government awards or other funding sources. Project contribution commitments that are not reimbursable total $80 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; The Company&#8217;s leases include property, equipment, and line leases. See Note 7, Leases , for additional information about future payments related to leases. \n\n&#8226; Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans that are unfunded. See Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans , for additional information about future payments under such plans. \n\n&#8226; Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. See Note 15, Investment in Affiliates and Related-Party Transactions , for additional information about future payments related to agreements with Conrail. \n\nOther Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nOther commitments total $178 million and primarily consist of guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, none of which are individually significant. These off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nLABOR AGREEMENTS \n\nApproximately 17,100 of the Company's approximately 22,500 employees are members of a rail labor union. As of December 2, 2022, all 12 rail unions at CSX that participated in national bargaining were covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that will remain in effect through December 31, 2024. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.36 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: \n\n&#8226; personal injury and environmental reserves; \n\n&#8226; pension plan accounting; \n\n&#8226; depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and \n\n&#8226; goodwill and other intangible assets. \n\nPersonal Injury and Environmental Reserves \n\nPersonal Injury \n\nPersonal Injury reserves of $126 million and $118 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nEnvironmental reserves were $161 million and $108 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 240 environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as: \n\n&#8226; type of clean-up required; \n\n&#8226; nature of the Company&#8217;s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site); \n\n&#8226; extent of the Company&#8217;s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and \n\n&#8226; number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.37 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates, continued &#160; \n\nConditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nPension Plan Accounting \n\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. Beginning in 2020, the CSX Pension Plan was closed to new participants. As of December 2022, the projected benefit obligation for the Company&#8217;s pension plans was $2.4 billion . For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension plans, see Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans . \n\nThe accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following: \n\n&#8226; discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense; \n\n&#8226; long-term rate of return on plan assets; and \n\n&#8226; other assumptions. \n\nThe Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.38 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates, continued \n\nDiscount Rates \n\nDiscount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments. \n\nThe Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity . \n\nThe weighted average discount rate used by the Company to value its pension obligations was 5.02% and 2.78% as of December 2022, and December 2021, respectively. As of December 2022, the estimated duration of pension benefits is approximately 10 years. \n\nEach year, the discount rate is reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rate will change. \n\nLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets \n\nThe expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2022 and 2021. \n\nOther Assumptions \n\nThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and salary inflation rates. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.39 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates, continued \n\n2023 Estimated Pension Expense \n\nNet periodic pension benefit expense for 2023 is expected to be a credit of $1 million. Net periodic pension benefit expense for 2023 is expected to include service cost expense of $24 million. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense in 2022 was a credit of $41 million. The net decrease in the expected credit is primarily due to impacts from recent unfavorable pension asset experience, partially offset by the increase in discount rates. \n\nThe following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1% change in certain assumptions on the 2023 estimated pension expense: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) Pension Expense Discount Rate $ 16 Long-term Rate of Return $ 24 ##TABLE_END\n\nDepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method \n\nThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 84% of total fixed assets of $48.1 billion on a gross basis at December 31, 2022. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis . Land is not depreciated. \n\nManagement performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management&#8217;s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include: \n\n&#8226; statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property; \n\n&#8226; statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property; \n\n&#8226; evaluation of current operations; \n\n&#8226; evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules; \n\n&#8226; previous assessment of the condition of the assets; \n\n&#8226; management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups; \n\n&#8226; expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and \n\n&#8226; comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.40 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates, continued &#160; \n\nThe STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2022, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. The 2022 equipment study resulted in an expected increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $80 million primarily due to deferred losses on assets depreciated using the group-life method. Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the Company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020. \n\nA 1% change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company&#8217;s annual depreciation expense. There were no significant changes to the company's asset lives as a result of the 2022 and 2020 studies. For additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see Note 6, Properties, in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nAs of December 2022, the Company had $502 million of Goodwill and Other Intangibles - Net. In applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, management must determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between depreciable and amortizable assets and goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital. \n\nCSX evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. In performing the qualitative impairment assessment, CSX considers relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, the Company would perform a quantitative impairment test. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill or intangible asset exceeded the fair value under the quantitative test, an impairment loss would be recorded. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy \n\nSee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption &#8220;New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.&#8221; \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.41 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nCertain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \n\n&#160; \n\nChanges in interest rates may impact the cost of future long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a result, represent interest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate forward contracts. The following information, together with information included in Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements , describes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX. \n\nChanges in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's forward starting interest rate swap. In 2020, the Company executed two forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $250 million for an aggregate notional value of $500 million. These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027. The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $80 million and $8 million net of tax during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income with the related asset on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In fourth quarter 2022, CSX settled a portion equal to $160 million notional value of the aggregate $500 million cash flow hedges, which resulted in CSX receiving a cash payment of $52 million. The gain associated with the settled portion of the hedges will continue to be classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) until the associated debt instrument is issued in the future. Upon final settlement of the swaps, which expire in 2027, the unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material. \n\nChanges in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. In 2022, CSX entered into five separate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps classified as fair value hedges. The swaps are designed to hedge 10 years of interest rate risk associated with market fluctuations attributable to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate on a cumulative $800 million of fixed rate outstanding notes, which are due between 2036 and 2040. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative fair value of these swaps was a $118 million liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The associated cumulative adjustment to the hedged notes is included in long-term debt. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt with no gain or loss recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. The difference in the net fixed-to-float interest settlement on the derivatives is recognized in interest expense and was not material for the year ending at December 31, 2022. The swaps will expire in 2032. If settled early, the remaining liability or asset will be amortized over the remaining life of the associated notes. As of December 31, 2022, the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, CSX has no floating rate notes outstanding. However, changes in interest rates could impact the fair value (but not the carrying value) of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in U.S. Treasury rates, or approximately 40 basis points, is estimated to be $709 million as of December 31, 2022, and $448 million as of December 31, 2021. The underlying fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.44 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosure to which it relates. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.46 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, continued \n\n##TABLE_START Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method Description of the Matter As of December 31, 2022, assets depreciated under the group-life method comprised 84% of total gross fixed assets of $48.1 billion. As discussed in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, the group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of the group&#8217;s recoverable life. The Company utilizes different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method. \n\nUnder the group-life method, depreciation studies are conducted by a third-party specialist and analyzed by the Company&#8217;s management to review asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation and other factors related to group assets. Depreciation studies are performed every three years for equipment assets and every six years for road and track assets. In years when depreciation studies are not performed, annual data reviews are conducted by a third-party specialist and analyzed by the Company&#8217;s management to review the asset service lives. A depreciation study was performed in 2022 for equipment assets. For road and track assets, the most recent depreciation study was performed in 2020 and was evaluated in the current year through an annual data review. \n\nAuditing depreciation expense for assets subject to the group-life method was complex and required the involvement of specialists due to the nature of the methods used in the depreciation studies to determine the useful service lives and salvage values of the Company&#8217;s assets. These methods have a significant effect on depreciation expense. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s process related to the assessment of periodic depreciation studies and annual data reviews of its group-life assets. For example, we tested controls over management&#8217;s review of the depreciation study for equipment assets and review of depreciation expense and estimated useful lives. We also tested controls over management&#8217;s annual data review of asset activity and assumptions that could impact the estimated useful lives determined in the most recent depreciation study of road and track assets. To test the estimated useful lives and salvage values of the Company&#8217;s group-life assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others: obtaining the periodic depreciation studies and annual data reviews performed by the Company&#8217;s third-party specialist and reviewed by management; assessing the completeness and accuracy of the data provided by management to the third-party specialist; and including a specialist on our team to evaluate the methods used by the third-party specialist and reviewed by management in determining the estimated useful lives and salvage values of assets resulting from the depreciation studies and any changes to the estimated useful lives and salvage values, if any, resulting from the annual data reviews. &#160; We compared the methods used by management to those used throughout the industry and within other depreciation studies. We assessed the historical accuracy of management&#8217;s estimates via retrospective review and independently calculated the current year depreciation rates. ##TABLE_END\n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1981. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nJacksonville, Florida \n\nFebruary 15, 2023 \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.47 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNOTE 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies \n\nBusiness \n\nCSX Corporation together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations. \n\nCSX Transportation, Inc. \n\nCSX&#8217;s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (&#8220;CSXT&#8221;), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 20,000 route mile rail network and serves major population centers in 26 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Company&#8217;s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections to more than 240 short-line and regional railroads. On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (&#8220;Pan Am&#8221;), which is the parent company of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This acquisition expands CSXT&#8217;s reach in the Northeastern United States. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations . \n\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities. Substantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations. \n\nOther Entities \n\nIn addition to CSXT, the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers, Inc. (\"Quality Carriers\"), CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (&#8220;CSX Intermodal Terminals&#8221;), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (&#8220;TDSI&#8221;), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (&#8220;Transflo&#8221;), CSX Technology, Inc. (&#8220;CSX Technology&#8221;) and other subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers, the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals truck transportation in North America. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations . CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States, and also provides drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks. The biggest Transflo markets are chemicals and agriculture, which include shipments of plastics and ethanol. CSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.53 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued \n\nLines of Business \n\nDuring 2022, the Company's services generated $ 14.9 billion of revenue and served four primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal, coal and trucking. \n\n&#8226; The merchandise business shipped 2.6 million carloads ( 41 % of volume) and generated $ 8.2 billion in revenue ( 55 % of revenue) in 2022. The Company&#8217;s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets: chemicals, agricultural and food products, minerals, automotive, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers. \n\n&#8226; The intermodal business shipped 3.0 million units ( 48 % of volume) and generated $ 2.3 billion in revenue ( 16 % of revenue) in 2022. The intermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of trucks and offers a cost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30 terminals, the intermodal business serves all major markets east of the Mississippi River and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments. \n\n&#8226; The coal business shipped 697 thousand carloads ( 11 % of volume) and generated $ 2.4 billion in revenue ( 16 % of revenue) in 2022. The Company transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and industrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Most of the export coal the Company transports is used for steelmaking, while the majority of domestic coal the Company ships is used for electricity generation. \n\n&#8226; The trucking business generated $ 966 million, or 7 %, of revenue in 2022. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers, which was acquired by CSX effective July 1, 2021. \n\nOther revenue accounted for 6 % of the Company&#8217;s total revenue in 2022. This category includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue from regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad. \n\nThe Company has two operating segments: rail and trucking. Although the Company provides a breakdown of revenue by line of business, the overall financial and operational performance of the railroad is analyzed as one operating segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. As the trucking segment is not material for separate disclosure, the results of all operations are included in one reportable segment. \n\nEmployees \n\nThe Company's number of employees was more than 22,500 as of December 2022, which includes approximately 17,100 union employees. Most of the Company&#8217;s employees provide or support transportation services. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.54 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal, recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial position of CSX and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders&#8217; equity for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020. Where applicable, prior year information has been reclassified to conform to current presentation. In addition, management has evaluated and disclosed all material events occurring subsequent to the date of the financial statements up to the date this annual report is filed on Form 10-K. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: \n\n&#8226; personal injury and environmental reserves (see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves ); \n\n&#8226; pension plan accounting (see Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans ); \n\n&#8226; depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method (see Note 6, Properties ); and \n\n&#8226; goodwill and other intangible assets (see Note 17, Business Combinations and Note 18, Goodwill and Other Intangibles ). \n\nFiscal Year \n\nThe Company's fiscal periods are based upon the calendar year. Except as otherwise specified, references to full years indicate CSX&#8217;s fiscal years ended on December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include results of operations of CSX and subsidiaries over which CSX has majority ownership or financial control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Most investments in companies that were not majority-owned were carried at cost (if less than 20 % owned and the Company has no significant influence) or were accounted for under the equity method (if the Company has significant influence but does not have control). These investments are reported within Investment in Affiliates and Other Companies on the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.55 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nOn a daily basis, cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in various highly liquid investments having a typical maturity date of three months or less at the date of acquisition. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value, and are classified as cash equivalents. \n\nInvestments \n\nInvestments in instruments with original maturities greater than three months that will mature in less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with original maturities of one year or greater are initially classified within other long-term assets, and the classification is re-evaluated at each balance sheet date. \n\nMaterials and Supplies \n\nMaterials and supplies in the consolidated balance sheets are carried at average cost and consist primarily of parts used in the repair and maintenance of track structure, equipment, and CSXT&#8217;s freight car and locomotive fleets, as well as fuel. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . As the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") will no longer be available beginning July 2023, this standard update provides practical expedients for contract modifications made as part of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and practical expedients can generally be applied through the extended period ending December 31, 2024. CSX's revolving line of credit currently uses LIBOR as a reference rate. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not applied the practical expedient to any contracts. \n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance . This standard update requires annual disclosure of the nature of any government assistance received, accounting policies related to such assistance and the effect of that assistance on the entity&#8217;s financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance effective year end 2022 and the standard update did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial position as the update only impacts disclosures.

Earnings Per Share \n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per share and earnings per share, assuming dilution: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended &#160; 2022 2021 2020 \n\nNumerator (Dollars in Millions) : \n\n&#160; Net Earnings $ 4,166 &#160; $ 3,781 &#160; $ 2,765 &#160; Dividend Equivalents on Restricted Stock &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net Earnings, Attributable to Common Shareholders $ 4,166 &#160; $ 3,781 &#160; $ 2,765 &#160; \n\nDenominator (Units in Millions) : \n\nAverage Common Shares Outstanding 2,136 &#160; 2,250 &#160; 2,300 &#160; Other Potentially Dilutive Common Shares 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; Average Common Shares Outstanding, Assuming Dilution 2,141 &#160; 2,255 &#160; 2,305 &#160; Net Earnings Per Share, Basic $ 1.95 &#160; $ 1.68 &#160; $ 1.20 &#160; Net Earnings Per Share, Assuming Dilution $ 1.95 &#160; $ 1.68 &#160; $ 1.20 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nBasic earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and common stock equivalents adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of potentially dilutive instruments. CSX's potentially dilutive instruments are made up of equity awards including performance units and employee stock options. \n\nWhen calculating diluted earnings per share, the potential shares that would be outstanding if all outstanding stock options were exercised are included. This number is different from outstanding stock options, which is included in Note 4, Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation , because it is offset by shares CSX could repurchase using the proceeds from these hypothetical exercises to obtain the common stock equivalent. The total average outstanding equity awards that were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect was antidilutive is in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended 2022 2021 2020 Antidilutive Stock Options Excluded from Diluted EPS (in millions) \n\n3 &#160; 2 &#160; 6 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nShare Repurchase Programs \n\nDuring July 2022, the share repurchase program announced in October 2020 was completed and the Company began repurchasing shares under the $ 5 billion share repurchase program approved on July 19, 2022. Total repurchase authority remaining was $ 3.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. Previously, shares were repurchased under a program announced in January 2019 that was completed in June 2021. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.57 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 2. Earnings Per Share, continued \n\nShare repurchases may be made through a variety of methods including, but not limited to, open market purchases, purchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchases and negotiated block purchases. The timing of share repurchases depends upon management's assessment of marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. In accordance with the Equity Topic in the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"), the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained earnings. \n\nShare Repurchase Activity \n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, CSX repurchased the following shares: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended 2022 2021 2020 Shares Repurchased (Units in Millions) \n\n151 &#160; 90 &#160; 38 &#160; Cost of Shares (Dollars in Millions) \n\n$ 4,731 &#160; $ 2,886 &#160; $ 867 &#160; Average Price Paid per Share $ 31.25 &#160; $ 31.91 &#160; $ 22.90 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nStructured Share Repurchases \n\nPeriodically, CSX enters into structured agreements for the repurchase of CSX shares. Upon execution of each agreement, the Company pays a fixed amount of cash in exchange for the right to receive either CSX stock or a predetermined amount of cash, including a premium. Shares acquired through these structured share repurchase agreements were recorded in common stock and retained earnings and are included in the share repurchases table above. There were no repurchases under a structured agreement in 2022. \n\nAs a result of entering into and settling structured share repurchase agreements, the Company paid a net total of approximately $ 378 million and received approximately 12 million shares during the year ended 2021. Premiums received were not material. \n\nIn December 2020, the Company completed a structured share repurchase. Under this agreement, the Company paid a total of $ 100 million and received approximately 3.3 million shares. \n\nDividend Increase \n\nOn February 14, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a 10 % increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $ 0.11 per common share effective March 2023. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.58 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

Preferred stock is senior to common stock with respect to dividends and upon liquidation of CSX. \n\nCommon Stock Split \n\nOn June 4, 2021, CSX announced a three -for-one split of the Company&#8217;s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record on June 18, 2021, received two additional shares of common stock for each share held as of this record date. The new shares were distributed after close of trading on June 28, 2021. All prior period share and per share amounts, common stock, other capital, and retained earnings were retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split. Proportional adjustments were also made to outstanding awards under the Company's stock-based compensation plans. \n\nOther Capital \n\nAs a result of the stock split during second quarter 2021, CSX's common stock balance was increased and its other capital balance was reduced commensurately. Because this adjustment brought the other capital balance below zero, $ 1.0 billion was reclassified from retained earnings to other capital to bring the other capital balance to zero as of June 30, 2021. Prior period amounts have also been retroactively adjusted as needed to bring the other capital balance to zero . \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.59 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 4. Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation \n\nUnder CSX's share-based compensation plans, awards consist of performance units, stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards for management and stock grants for directors. Awards granted under the various programs are determined and approved by the Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board of Directors. Awards to the Chief Executive Officer are approved by the full Board and awards to senior executives are approved by the Compensation and Talent Management Committee. In certain circumstances, the Chief Executive Officer or delegate approves awards to management employees other than senior executives. The Board of Directors approves awards granted to CSX's non-management directors upon recommendation of the Governance and Sustainability Committee. \n\nShare-based compensation expense for awards under share-based compensation plans and purchases made as part of the employee stock purchase plan is measured using the fair value of the award on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the respective award. Alternatively, expense is recognized upon death or upon grant date to certain retirement-eligible employees whose agreements allow for continued vesting upon retirement. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Total pre-tax expense and income tax benefits associated with share-based compensation are shown in the table below. Income tax benefits include impacts from option exercises and the vesting of other equity awards. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Share-Based Compensation Expense Performance Units $ 35 &#160; $ 71 &#160; $ ( 3 ) Stock Options 17 &#160; 18 &#160; 19 &#160; Restricted Stock Units and Awards 15 &#160; 12 &#160; 6 &#160; Employee Stock Purchase Plan 5 &#160; 4 &#160; 5 &#160; Stock Awards for Directors 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Total Share-based Compensation Expense $ 74 &#160; $ 107 &#160; $ 29 &#160; Income Tax Benefit $ 17 &#160; $ 23 &#160; $ 19 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nLong-term Incentive Plans \n\nThe objective of the CSX Long-term Incentive Plans (&#8220;LTIP&#8221;) is to motivate and reward certain employees for achieving and exceeding certain financial goals. The 2022-2024, 2021-2023 and 2020-2022 LTIPs were adopted under the 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan. Grants were made in performance units, with each unit being equivalent to one share of CSX common stock, and payouts will be made in CSX common stock. The payout range for most participants will be between 0 % and 200 % of the target awards depending on Company performance against predetermined goals for each three-year cycle. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.60 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 4. Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation, continued \n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, target performance units were granted to certain employees under three separate LTIP plans covering three-year cycles: the 2022-2024 (\"2022-2024 LTIP\"), the 2021-2023 (\"2021-2023 LTIP\") and the 2020-2022 (\"2020-2022 LTIP\") plans. Payouts of performance units for the plans will be based on the achievement of certain goals, in each case excluding non-recurring items as disclosed in the Company&#8217;s financial statements. \n\n&#8226; For the 2022-2024 LTIP plan, the average annual operating income growth percentage and CSX Cash Earnings (\"CCE\"), in each case excluding non-recurring items as defined in the plan, will each comprise 50 % of the payout and will be measured independently of the other. Participants will receive stock dividend equivalents declared over the performance period based on the number of performance units paid upon vesting. As defined under the plan, CCE is a cash-flow-based measure that incentivizes strategic investments earning more than the required return. CCE equals CSX&#8217;s gross cash earnings (after-tax EBITDA) minus the required return on gross operating assets. \n\n&#8226; For the 2021-2023 LTIP plan, the average annual operating income growth percentage and cumulative free cash flow over the plan period will each comprise 50 % of the payout and will be measured independently of the other. Participants will receive stock dividend equivalents declared over the performance period based on the number of performance units paid upon vesting. \n\n&#8226; For the 2020-2022 LTIP plan, the cumulative operating income and cumulative free cash flow over the plan period will each comprise 50 % of the payout and will be measured independently of the other. Participants will receive stock dividend equivalents declared over the performance period based on the number of performance units paid upon vesting. \n\nFor these plans, payouts for certain executive officers are subject to formulaic upward or downward adjustment by up to 25 %, capped at an overall payout of 250 %, based upon the Company&#8217;s total shareholder return relative to specified comparable groups over the performance period. \n\nThe fair values of the performance units awarded during the years ended December 2022, 2021 and 2020 were calculated primarily using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the following weighted-average assumptions: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended Weighted-Average Assumptions Used: 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free Interest Rate 2.3 &#160; % 0.2 &#160; % 1.4 &#160; % Annualized Volatility 33.0 &#160; % 33.6 &#160; % 24.5 &#160; % \n\nExpected Life (in years) \n\n2.7 2.9 2.9 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe risk-free interest rate assumptions reflect the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The annualized volatility is based on observed historical volatility of daily stock returns for the three-year period preceding the grant date. The expected life is calculated using the remainder of the performance period. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.61 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

With these grants, an employee receives an award that provides the opportunity in the future to purchase CSX shares at the closing market price of the stock on the date the award is granted (the strike price). Options granted become exercisable in equal installments on the anniversary of the grant date over a vesting period ( three-year graded). All options expire 10 years from the grant date if they are not exercised. \n\nThe fair value of stock options granted was estimated as of the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which uses the following assumptions: dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, annualized volatility and expected life. The annual dividend yield is based on the most recent quarterly CSX dividend payment annualized. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The annualized volatility is based on historical volatility of daily CSX stock price returns over a 6.0 year look-back period ending on the grant date. The expected life is calculated using the safe harbor approach due to lack of historical data on CSX options, which is the midpoint between the vesting schedule and contractual term ( 10 years). \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.62 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 5. Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued &#160; \n\nThese liabilities are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC. Actual settlements and claims received could differ and final outcomes of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Considering the legal defenses currently available, the liabilities that have been recorded and other factors, it is the opinion of management that none of these items individually, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Should a number of these items occur in the same period, however, their combined effect could be material in that particular period. \n\nCasualty \n\nCasualty reserves of $ 194 million and $ 180 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, represent accruals for personal injury, occupational disease and occupational injury claims primarily related to railroad operations. Casualty reserves include liabilities assumed as a result of the Company's acquisition of Pan Am in 2022. Beginning June 1, 2021, the Company's self-insured retention amount for casualty claims increased from $ 75 million to $ 100 million per occurrence. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. \n\nThese reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. Changes in casualty reserves are included in purchased services and other on the consolidated income statements. \n\nPersonal Injury \n\nPersonal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers' Liability Act (\"FELA\"). CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. These analyses did not result in a material adjustment to the personal injury reserve in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.67 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 5. Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued \n\nOccupational \n\nOccupational reserves represent liabilities arising from allegations of exposure to certain materials in the workplace (such as solvents, soaps, chemicals and diesel fumes), past exposure to asbestos or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions (such as repetitive stress injuries). The Company retains an independent actuary to analyze the Company&#8217;s historical claims, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to assist in determining future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values. This analysis is performed by the actuary and reviewed by management quarterly. There were no material adjustments to the occupational reserve in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nEnvironmental reserves were $ 161 million and $ 108 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Environmental reserves include liabilities assumed as a result of the Company's acquisition of Pan Am in 2022 and Quality Carriers in 2021. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 240 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company. \n\nIn any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.68 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 5. Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued \n\nIn accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as: \n\n&#8226; type of clean-up required; \n\n&#8226; nature of the Company&#8217;s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site); \n\n&#8226; extent of the Company&#8217;s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and \n\n&#8226; number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location. \n\nBased on management's review process, amounts have been recorded to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are reasonably estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in purchased services and other on the consolidated income statements. \n\nCurrently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the estimated cost of remedial actions currently required. \n\nOther \n\nOther reserves were $ 81 million and $ 80 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. These reserves include liabilities assumed as a result of the Company's acquisition of Pan Am in 2022 and Quality Carriers in 2021. Other reserves include liabilities for various claims, such as automobile, property, general liability, workers' compensation and longshoremen disability claims. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.69 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 6. Properties, continued \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nThe Company&#8217;s capital investment includes purchased and self-constructed assets and property additions that substantially extend the service life or increase the utility of those assets. Indirect costs that can be specifically traced to capital projects are also capitalized. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and expanding its network capacity for long-term growth. Rail operations are capital intensive and CSX accounts for these costs in accordance with GAAP and the Company&#8217;s capitalization policy. All properties are stated at historical cost less an allowance for accumulated depreciation. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s largest category of capital investment is the replacement of track assets and the acquisition or construction of new assets that enable CSX to enhance its operations or provide new capacity offerings to its customers. These construction projects are primarily completed by CSXT employees. &#160; Costs for track asset replacement and capacity projects that are capitalized include: \n\n&#8226; labor costs, because many of the assets are self-constructed; \n\n&#8226; costs to purchase or construct new track or to prepare ground for the laying of track; \n\n&#8226; welding (rail, field and plant), which are processes used to connect segments of rail; \n\n&#8226; new ballast, which is gravel and crushed stone that holds track in line; \n\n&#8226; fuels and lubricants associated with tie, rail and surfacing work, which is the process of raising track to a designated elevation over an extended distance; \n\n&#8226; cross, switch and bridge ties, which are the braces that support the rails on a track; \n\n&#8226; gauging, which is the process of standardizing the distance between rails; \n\n&#8226; handling costs associated with installing rail, ties or ballast; \n\n&#8226; usage charge of machinery and equipment utilized in construction or installation; and \n\n&#8226; other track materials. \n\nLabor is a significant cost in self-constructed track replacement work. CSXT engineering employees directly charge their labor to the track replacement project (the capitalized depreciable property). In replacing track, these employees concurrently perform deconstruction and installation of track material. Because of this concurrent process, CSX must estimate the amount of labor that is related to deconstruction versus installation. As a component of the depreciation study for road and track assets, management performs an analysis of labor costs related to the self-constructed track replacement work, which includes direct observation of track replacement processes. Through this analysis, CSX determined that approximately 20 % of labor costs associated with track replacement is related to the deconstruction of old track, for which certain elements are expensed, and 80 % is associated with the installation of new track, which is capitalized. \n\nCapital investment related to locomotives and freight cars comprises the second largest category of the Company&#8217;s capital assets. This category includes purchases of locomotives and freight cars as well as certain equipment leases that are considered to be finance leases in accordance with the Leases Topic in the ASC. In addition, costs to modify or rebuild these assets are capitalized if the investment incurred extends the asset&#8217;s service life or improves utilization. Improvement projects must meet specified dollar thresholds to be capitalized and are reviewed by management to determine proper accounting treatment. Routine repairs, overhauls and other maintenance costs, for all asset categories, are expensed as incurred. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.72 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 6. Properties, continued \n\nDepreciation Method \n\nThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 84 % of total fixed assets of $ 48.1 billion on a gross basis as of December 2022. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated. \n\nThe group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its group&#8217;s recoverable life. The Company currently utilizes different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets. All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis. \n\nThe group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g. track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most accurate and effective way to properly depreciate its assets. \n\nDepreciation Studies \n\nManagement performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management&#8217;s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company&#8217;s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company believes the frequency of depreciation studies currently required by the STB, complemented by annual data reviews conducted by a third-party specialist and analyzed by the Company's management, provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets. \n\nThe Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2022, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. The 2022 equipment study resulted in an expected increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $ 80 million primarily due to deferred losses on assets depreciated using the group-life method. Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the Company's depreciation expense of $ 1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.73 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 6. Properties, continued \n\nGroup-Life Assets Sales and Retirements \n\nSince the rail network is one contiguous, connected network it is impractical to maintain specific identification records for these assets. For track assets (e.g., rail, ties, and ballast), CSX utilizes a first-in, first-out approach to asset retirements. Equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) are specifically identified at retirement. When an equipment asset is retired that has been depreciated using the group-life method, the cost is reduced from the cost base and recorded in accumulated depreciation. \n\nFor sales or retirements of assets depreciated under the group-life method that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is immediately recognized. This practice is consistent with accounting treatment prescribed under the group-life method. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with the group-life method is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time. \n\nFor sales or retirements of assets depreciated under the group-life method that do not occur in the ordinary course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the sale or retirement meets each of the following three criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is material in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. No material gains or losses were recognized on the sale of assets depreciated using the group-life method in 2022, 2021 or 2020, as no sales met the criteria described above. \n\nLand and Straight-line Assets Sales and Retirements \n\nWhen the Company sells or retires land, land-related easements or assets depreciated under the straight-line method, a gain or loss is recognized in purchased services and other on the consolidated statements of income . Primarily as a result of its initiative to monetize non-core properties, the Company recognized gains on the sale of properties of $ 238 million, $ 454 million and $ 35 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia \n\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (&#8220;Commonwealth&#8221;) over three phases for a total of $ 525 million. The timing and amount of gains recognized were based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. In April 2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $ 200 million in proceeds and recognized a $ 349 million gain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $ 200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first phase with the remainder attributable to the second phase. The second phase closed in January 2022, which resulted in a $ 20 million gain in first quarter 2022. During June 2022, the Commonwealth approved the remaining proceeds, which resulted in a $ 122 million gain in second quarter 2022 related to property rights previously conveyed. Those remaining proceeds of $ 125 million were collected during fourth quarter 2022 upon closing of the third phase, resulting in a $ 2 million gain. Over the course of this transaction, which is now complete, total proceeds of $ 525 million have been collected and total gains of $ 493 million have been recognized. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.74 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

Initial assessments of recoverability are based on estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows associated with an asset or a group of assets in accordance with the Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic in the ASC. Where impairment is indicated, the assets are evaluated and their carrying amount is reduced to fair value based on discounted net cash flows or other estimates of fair value. Impairment expense of $ 4 million in 2022, $ 2 million in 2021 and $ 8 million in 2020 was primarily due to the discontinuation of certain in-progress projects. Impairment expense is recorded in purchased services and other expense on the consolidated income statement. \n\nGovernment Assistance \n\nThe Company is a party to contracts with recipients and subrecipients of awards from federal, state and local governmental agencies. These contracts meet the disclosure requirements under ASU 2021-10, Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which the Company adopted effective year end 2022. These awards are typically in the form of cash for purposes of making improvements to the rail network as part of public safety, corridor expansion or economic revitalization initiatives. The awarding agency generally specifies how the awards are to be spent by the recipients and may include limited conditions requiring return of the assistance. \n\nGovernment funding received or receivable related to a property asset is netted with the cost of the asset in properties on the consolidated balance sheet, and the net asset is subject to depreciation. Any amounts owed by the government entity are recorded within accounts receivable until reimbursed. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the total amounts received under contracts with government entities to improve the rail network was $ 49 million and $ 66 million, respectively. Non-freight accounts receivable related to these government projects was $ 34 million and $ 7 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.75 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

Some of the Company&#8217;s lease arrangements contain lease components (e.g., minimum rent payments) and non-lease components (e.g., maintenance, labor charges, etc.). The Company generally accounts for each component separately based on the estimated standalone price of each component. For certain equipment leases, such as freight car, vehicles and work equipment, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically for an index or rate. The leases are initially measured using the projected payments adjusted for the index or rate in effect at the commencement date. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. \n\nOperating Leases \n\nOperating leases are included in right-of-use lease assets, other current liabilities and long-term lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company&#8217;s secured incremental borrowing rates or implicit rates, when readily determinable. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the balance sheet. \n\nThe Company has various lease agreements with other parties with terms up to 50 years. Non-cancelable, long-term leases may include provisions for maintenance, options to purchase and options to extend the terms. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for operating leases, including leases with escalations over their terms, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease expense is recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Lease expense is included in equipment and other rents on the consolidated income statements and is reported net of lease income. Lease income was not material to the results of operations for 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.76 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

The maintenance program costs are based on the maintenance cycle for each covered locomotive, which is determined by the asset's age and type. Expected future costs may change as required maintenance schedules are revised and locomotives are placed into or removed from service. Under CSXT&#8217;s current obligations, the agreement will expire no earlier than 2035. \n\nThe following table summarizes the number of locomotives covered and CSXT&#8217;s payments, including prepayments, under the long-term maintenance program. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Amounts Paid $ 128 &#160; $ 99 &#160; $ 158 &#160; Number of Locomotives 1,871 &#160; 1,863 &#160; 1,874 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.78 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

A certain amount of risk is retained by the Company on each insurance program. Under its property insurance program, the Company retains all risk up to $ 100 million per occurrence for losses from floods and named windstorms and up to $ 75 million per occurrence for other property losses. For third-party liability claims, the Company retains all risk up to $ 100 million per occurrence. As CSX negotiates insurance coverage above its full self-retention amounts, it retains a percentage of risk at various layers of coverage. While the Company believes its insurance coverage is adequate, future claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. \n\nLegal \n\nThe Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge practices, tax matters, environmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA and labor claims by current or former employees, other personal injury or property claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. \n\n&#160; \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.79 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 8. Commitments and Contingencies, continued \n\nThe Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss for certain legal proceedings for which a loss is reasonably possible in excess of reserves established. The Company has estimated this range to be $ 3 million to $ 21 million in aggregate as of December 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate. \n\nFuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation \n\nIn May 2007, class action lawsuits were filed against CSXT and three other U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that the defendants' fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws. The class action lawsuits were consolidated into one case in federal court in the District of Columbia. In 2017, the District Court issued its decision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court&#8217;s ruling. \n\nThe consolidated case is now moving forward without class certification. Although the class was not certified, individual shippers have since brought claims against the railroads, which have been consolidated into a separate case. \n\nCSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit. Accordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously. However, penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, and resolution of these matters individually or when aggregated could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nCSXT is indemnifying Pharmacia LLC, formerly known as Monsanto Company, (\"Pharmacia\") for certain liabilities associated with real estate located in Kearny, New Jersey along the Lower Passaic River (the &#8220;Property&#8221;). The Property, which was formerly owned by Pharmacia, is now owned by CSXT. CSXT's indemnification and defense duties arise with respect to several matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), using its CERCLA authority, seeks the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances in the 17 -mile Lower Passaic River Study Area (the \"Study Area&#8221;). CSXT, on behalf of Pharmacia, and a significant number of other potentially responsible parties are together conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of the Study Area pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA. Pharmacia&#8217;s share of responsibility, indemnified by CSXT, for the investigation and cleanup costs of the Study Area may be determined through various mechanisms including (a) an allocation and settlement with EPA; (b) litigation brought by EPA against non-settling parties; or (c) litigation among the responsible parties. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.80 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 8. Commitments and Contingencies, continued \n\nFor the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, EPA issued its Record of Decision detailing the agency&#8217;s mandated remedial process in March 2016. Approximately 80 parties, including Pharmacia, are participating in an EPA-directed allocation and settlement process to assign responsibility for the remedy selected for the lower 8 miles of the Study Area. CSXT is participating in the EPA-directed allocation and settlement process on behalf of Pharmacia. For the remainder of the Study Area, EPA has selected an interim remedy in a Record of Decision dated September 28, 2021. Settlement discussions are also ongoing for the selected interim remedy. \n\nOn March 2, 2022, EPA issued a Notice Letter to Pharmacia, Occidental Chemical Corporation and eight other parties alleging they are liable under Section 107(a) of CERCLA for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances and requesting each party, individually or collectively, submit good faith offers to EPA in connection with the Study Area. CSX, on behalf of Pharmacia, responded to the Notice Letter and submitted a good faith offer to EPA on June 27, 2022, following meetings with a mediator from EPA&#8217;s Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center. Negotiations with EPA and other parties to resolve this matter continue. \n\nCSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia with regard to the Property in litigation filed by Occidental Chemical Corporation, which is seeking to recover various costs. These costs include costs for the remedial design of the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, as well as anticipated costs associated with the future remediation of the entire Study Area. Alternatively, Occidental seeks to compel some, or all of the defendants to participate in the remediation of the Study Area. Pharmacia is one of approximately 110 defendants in this federal lawsuit filed by Occidental on June 30, 2018. CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in a cooperative natural resource damages assessment process related to the Property. \n\nBased on currently available information, the Company does not believe its share of remediation costs as determined by the EPA-directed allocation with respect to the Property and the Study Area would be material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.81 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. The CSX Pension Plan, the largest plan based on benefit obligation, was closed to new participants beginning in 2020. \n\nThe Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections.

Employee Benefit Plans, continued \n\nPost-retirement Medical Plan \n\nIn addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation related to this plan was $ 61 million and $ 81 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Through 2032, total future expected benefit payments related to this plan were $ 55 million. Expenses in 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to this plan were not material. \n\nOther Plans \n\nUnder collective bargaining agreements, the Company participates in a multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible contract employees. Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to $ 13 million, $ 21 million and $ 20 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe Company maintains savings plans for virtually all full-time salaried employees and certain employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Expense associated with these plans was $ 28 million, $ 29 million and $ 39 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is included in labor and fringe expense on the consolidated income statement. \n\nUnder the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees, Quality Carriers contributes to three multi-employer pension plans. These plans provide defined benefits to retired participants. All three of these pension plans are in Pension Protection Act zone &#8220;red&#8221;, meaning they are at least 65% underfunded. Formal rehabilitation plans have been adopted. As of December 31, 2022, based on information provided to the Company from the administrators of these plans, Quality Carriers&#8217; portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from these plans is approximately $ 336 million, of which $ 328 million relates to the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan. The Company has withdrawn from one of the plans, resulting in an immaterial withdrawal liability, but does not currently intend to withdraw from the remaining multi-employer pension plans. Required monthly contributions to these plans are not material. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.89 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 10.

The swaps are designed to hedge 10 years of interest rate risk associated with market fluctuations attributable to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate on a cumulative $ 800 million of fixed rate outstanding notes which are due between 2036 and 2040. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative fair value of these swaps was a $ 118 million liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The associated cumulative adjustment to the hedged notes is included in long-term debt. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt with no gain or loss recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. The difference in the net fixed-to-float interest settlement on the derivatives is recognized in interest expense and was not material for the year ending at December 31, 2022. The swaps will expire in 2032. If settled early, the remaining cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged notes will be amortized over the remaining life of the associated notes. The amounts recorded in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet related to these fair value hedges is summarized in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n(Dollars in Millions) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nNotional Value of Hedged Notes \n\n$ 800 &#160; \n\nCumulative Fair Value Adjustment to Hedged Notes \n\n( 118 ) \n\nCarrying Amount of Hedged Notes \n\n$ 682 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.91 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of $ 850 million of 3.25 % notes due in 2027. In accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging Topic in the ASC, the Company has designated these swaps as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the asset value of the forward starting interest rate swaps was $ 127 million and $ 91 million, respectively, and was recorded in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. \n\nUnrealized gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) on the consolidated balance sheet. In fourth quarter 2022, CSX settled a portion equal to $ 160 million notional value of the aggregate $ 500 million cash flow hedges, which resulted in CSX receiving a cash payment of $ 52 million included in other operating activities on the consolidated cash flow statement. The gain associated with the settled portion of the hedges will continue to be classified in AOCI until the associated debt instrument is issued in the future. Unless settled early, the remainder of the swaps will expire in 2027 and the unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Unrealized gains, recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income, related to the hedges were $ 80 million, $ 8 million and $ 62 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nSee Note 13, Fair Value Measurements , and Note 16, Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) , for other information about the Company's hedges. \n\nCredit Facilities \n\nCSX has a $ 1.2 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. This facility allows same-day borrowings at floating interest rates, based on LIBOR or an agreed-upon replacement reference rate, plus a spread that depends upon CSX's senior unsecured debt ratings. This facility expires in March 2024, and as of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. \n\nCommitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility were similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade borrowers. As of December 31, 2022, CSX was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the facility. \n\nCommercial Paper \n\nUnder its commercial paper program, which is backed by the revolving credit facility, the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $ 1.0 billion. Proceeds from issuances of the notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.92 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 11.

The Company&#8217;s performance obligation arises when it receives a bill of lading (&#8220;BOL&#8221;) to transport a customer's commodities at a negotiated price contained in a transportation services agreement or a publicly disclosed tariff rate. Once a BOL is received, a contract is formed whereby the parties are committed to perform, collectability of consideration is probable and the rights of the parties, shipping terms and conditions, and payment terms are identified. A customer may submit several BOLs for transportation services at various times throughout a service agreement term, but each shipment represents a distinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.93 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 11. Revenues, continued \n\nThe average transit time to complete a rail shipment is between 2 to 8 days depending on market. Payments for transportation services are normally billed once a BOL is received and are generally due within 15 days after the invoice date. The Company recognizes revenue over transit time of freight as it moves from origin to destination. Revenue for services started but not completed at the reporting date is allocated based on the relative transit time in each reporting period, with the portion allocated for services subsequent to the reporting date considered remaining performance obligations. \n\nThe certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Revenue associated with shipments in transit, which is recognized ratably over transit time and is based on average cycle times to move commodities and products from their origin to their final destination or interchange; \n\n&#8226; Adjustments to revenue for billing corrections and billing discounts; \n\n&#8226; Adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are based on historical payments to customers for rate overcharges as a percentage of total billing; and \n\n&#8226; Incentive-based refunds to customers, which are primarily volume-related, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on the basis of the projected liability (this estimate is based on historical activity, current volume levels and forecasted future volume). \n\nRevenue related to interline transportation services that involve the services of another party, such as another railroad, is reported on a net basis. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is not reflected as revenue. \n\nEffective third quarter 2021, trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers and is mostly comprised of truck shipments of chemicals. A performance obligation arises when Quality Carriers receives a customer order to transport a commodity at a contracted rate. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis ratably over transit time. \n\nOther revenue is recorded upon completion of the service and is comprised of revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue from regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad. \n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.94 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

This includes the unearned portion of billed and unbilled amounts for cancellable freight shipments in transit. The Company expects to recognize the unearned portion of revenue for freight services in transit within one week of the reporting date. As of December 31, 2022, remaining performance obligations were not material. \n\nContract Balances and Accounts Receivable \n\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in accounts receivable and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheets. Contract assets, contract liabilities and deferred contract costs recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 were not material. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s accounts receivable - net consists of freight and non-freight receivables, reduced by an allowance for credit losses. \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Freight Receivables $ 1,067 &#160; $ 951 &#160; Freight Allowance for Credit Losses ( 16 ) ( 14 ) Freight Receivables, net 1,051 &#160; 937 &#160; Non-Freight Receivables 279 &#160; 225 &#160; Non-Freight Allowance for Credit Losses ( 17 ) ( 14 ) Non-Freight Receivables, net 262 &#160; 211 &#160; Total Accounts Receivable, net $ 1,313 &#160; $ 1,148 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFreight receivables include amounts earned, billed and unbilled , and currently due from customers for transportation-related services. Non-freight receivables include amounts billed and unbilled and currently due related to government reimbursement receivables and other non-revenue receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of risk characteristics, historical payment experience, and the age of outstanding receivables adjusted for forward-looking economic conditions as necessary. Credit losses recognized on the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable were not material in 2022 and 2021. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.95 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

In 2021, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 48 million primarily as a result of favorable state legislative changes, additional tax benefits associated with the vesting of share-based awards and adjustments to deferred taxes as a result of filing the 2020 state tax returns. In 2020, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 30 million primarily as a result of the additional tax benefit associated with vesting of share-based awards and the resolution of certain tax matters. \n\nIncome tax expense reconciled to the tax computed at statutory rates is presented in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended (Dollars In Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Federal Income Taxes $ 1,137 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 1,040 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 762 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % State Income Taxes 121 &#160; 2.2 &#160; % 139 &#160; 2.8 &#160; % 117 &#160; 3.2 &#160; % Other ( 10 ) ( 0.1 ) % ( 9 ) ( 0.2 ) % ( 17 ) ( 0.4 ) % Income Tax Expense/ Rate $ 1,248 &#160; 23.1 &#160; % $ 1,170 &#160; 23.6 &#160; % $ 862 &#160; 23.8 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.96 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

CSX and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. CSX participated in a contemporaneous IRS audit of tax years 2022 and 2021. Federal examinations of original federal income tax returns for all years through 2020 are resolved. \n\nAs of December 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $ 18 million and $ 18 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits as a result of uncertain tax positions. Net tax benefits of $ 14 million and $ 15 million as of December 2022 and 2021, respectively, could favorably impact the effective income tax rate in each year. The Company does not expect that unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2022 for various state and federal income tax matters will significantly change over the next 12 months. The final outcome of these uncertain tax positions is not yet determinable. There were no material changes to the total gross unrecognized tax benefits and prior year audit resolutions of the Company during the year ended December 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nCSX&#8217;s continuing practice is to recognize net interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were not material as of December 2022 or 2021. Additionally, expenses from changes to the reserves for interest and penalties were not material in 2022, 2021 or 2020 . \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.97 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\nNOTE 13. Fair Value Measurements \n\nThe Financial Instruments Topic in the ASC requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in annual reports as well as in quarterly reports. For CSX, this statement applies to certain investments, pension plan assets, long-term debt and interest rate derivatives. Also, the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic in the ASC clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. \n\nVarious inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company's investments, pension plan assets, long-term debt and interest rate derivatives. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below: \n\n&#8226; Level 1 &#8211; observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; \n\n&#8226; Level 2 &#8211; other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.); and \n\n&#8226; Level 3 &#8211; significant unobservable inputs (including the Company&#8217;s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of investments). \n\nThe valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. \n\nInvestments \n\nThe Company's investment assets are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic in the ASC. They are valued with assistance from a third-party trustee and consist of fixed income mutual funds, corporate bonds and government securities. The fixed income mutual funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held based on quoted market prices determined in an active market, which are Level 1 inputs. The corporate bonds and government securities are valued using broker quotes that utilize observable market inputs, which are Level 2 inputs. Unrealized losses as of December 31, 2022, were not material.

The majority of the Company's long-term debt is valued with assistance from a third party that utilizes closing transactions, market quotes or market values of comparable debt. For those instruments not valued by the third party, the fair value has been estimated by applying market rates of similar instruments to the scheduled contractual debt payments and maturities. These market rates are provided by the same third party. All of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company's long-term debt are Level 2 inputs. \n\nThe fair value of outstanding debt fluctuates with changes in a number of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, market conditions, credit ratings, values of similar financial instruments, size of the transaction, cash flow projections and comparable trades. Fair value will exceed carrying value when the current market interest rate is lower than the interest rate at which the debt was originally issued. The fair value of a company's debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. It does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.99 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

The Investment Committee targets an allocation of pension assets to be generally 60 % growth-oriented and 40 % immunizing. See Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans, for further information. There are several valuation methodologies used for those assets as described below. \n\nInvestments in the Fair Value Hierarchy \n\n&#8226; Common stock (Level 1): Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded on the last day of the year and classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\n&#8226; Mutual funds (Level 1 ): Valued at the net asset value of shares held at year end based on quoted market prices determined in an active market. These assets are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\n&#8226; Cash and cash equivalents (Level 1) : Includes cash and short term investments with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents at year end approximates fair value. These assets are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\n&#8226; Corporate bonds, government securities, asset-backed securities and derivatives (Level 2) : Valued using price evaluations reflecting the bid and/or ask sides of the market for a similar investment at year end. Asset-backed securities include commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.

Total comprehensive earnings are defined as all changes in shareholders' equity during a period, other than those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders. Generally, for CSX, total comprehensive earnings equal net earnings plus or minus adjustments for pension and other post-retirement liabilities as well as derivative activity and other adjustments. Total comprehensive earnings represent the activity for a period net of tax and were $ 4.2 billion, $ 4.0 billion and $ 2.8 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nWhile total comprehensive earnings is the activity in a period and is largely driven by net earnings in that period, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) represents the cumulative balance of other comprehensive income, net of tax, as of the balance sheet date. For CSX, AOCI is primarily the cumulative balance related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments, interest rate derivatives and CSX's share of AOCI of equity method investees. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.105 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nItem 8.

Goodwill recognized in this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. \n\nAcquisition of Quality Carriers, Inc. \n\nAs a result of the acquisition of Quality Carriers, Inc. on July 1, 2021, CSX recognized goodwill and intangible assets. The goodwill of $ 213 million was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of net assets assumed as of July 1, 2021 and relates primarily to the ability of CSX to extend the reach of its network and gain access to new products, markets, and regions through a unique and competitive multimodal solution that leverages the reach of truck transportation with the cost advantage of rail-based services. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. \n\nIntangible assets of $ 180 million consist of $ 150 million of customer relationships and $ 30 million of trade names that will be amortized over a weighted-average period of 20 years and 15 years, respectively. \n\nDuring 2022, Quality Carriers completed several acquisitions that were immaterial individually and in aggregate that resulted in the addition of $ 26 million of goodwill and $ 18 million other intangible assets. \n\nPrior to 2021, the Company's goodwill balance related to affiliates of CSXT, primarily P&#38;L Transportation, Inc. In fourth quarter 2022, CSX performed its annual evaluation of each reporting unit's goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. No impairment was recorded as a result of this evaluation. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.110 \n\n"

Controls and Procedures \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of CSX's Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in CSX&#8217;s periodic SEC reports. \n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nCSX&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the management of CSX, including CSX&#8217;s CEO and CFO, CSX conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, which is also referred to as COSO. Based on that evaluation, management of CSX concluded that the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst &#38; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.111 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CSX Corporation \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited CSX Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, CSX Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of CSX Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders&#8217; equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes of the Company and our report dated February 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.112 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, continued \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nJacksonville, Florida \n\nFebruary 15, 2023 \n\n&#160; \n\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.113 \n\nCSX CORPORATION \n\nPART II \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no material changes in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\n"
