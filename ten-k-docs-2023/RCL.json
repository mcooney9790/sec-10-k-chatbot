      "text": " Item 1. Business. \n\nGeneral \n\nWe are one of the leading cruise companies in the world. We own and operate three global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our \"Global Brands\"). We also own a 50% joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH (\"TUIC\"), which operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). We account for our investments in our Partner Brands under the equity method of accounting. Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands have a combined fleet of 64 ships in the cruise vacation industry with an aggregate capacity of approximately 150,005 berths as of December 31, 2022. \n\nOur ships offer a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations on all seven continents. In addition to our headquarters in Miami, Florida, we have offices and a network of international representatives around the world, which primarily focus on sales and market development. \n\nWe compete principally by operating valued brands that offer exceptional service provided by our crew and on the basis of innovation and quality of ships, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations and price. We believe that our commitment to build state-of-the-art ships and to invest in the maintenance and upgrade of our fleet to, among other things, incorporate many of our latest signature innovations, allows us to continue to attract new and loyal repeat guests. \n\nRoyal Caribbean was founded in 1968 as a partnership. Its corporate structure has evolved over the years and, the current parent corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. \n\nAs a result of the global pandemic impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in March 2020 and began resuming guest cruise operations in 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. We continue to prioritize our financial recovery and the further enhancement of our financial results and liquidity. \n\nOur Global Brands \n\nOur Global Brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises. We believe our Global Brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our Global Brands has its own marketing style, as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our Global Brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our Global Brands also offer similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our Global Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, we strategically manage our Global Brands as a single business with the ultimate objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value. \n\nRoyal Caribbean International \n\nRoyal Caribbean International is the world's largest cruise brand. The brand competes in both the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise vacation industry and appeals to families with children of all ages, as well as both older and younger couples. Royal Caribbean International offers cruises and land destinations that generally feature a casual ambiance, as well as a variety of activities and entertainment venues. We believe that the quality of the Royal Caribbean International brand allows it to achieve market coverage that is among the broadest of any of the major cruise brands in the cruise vacation industry. Royal Caribbean International&#8217;s strategy is to attract an array of vacationing guests by offering a wide variety of itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Panama Canal and New Zealand, with cruise lengths generally ranging from two to 19 nights. Royal Caribbean International offers multiple innovative options for onboard dining, entertainment and other onboard activities. Because of the brand&#8217;s ability to deliver extensive and innovative product offerings at an excellent value to consumers, we believe Royal Caribbean International is well positioned to attract new consumers to cruising and to continue to bring loyal repeat guests back for their next vacation. \n\nRoyal Caribbean International operates 26 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 94,100 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, Royal Caribbean International had four ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22,500 berths. The ships on order include the first three ships of a new generation of vessels, known as the Icon-class, and our sixth Oasis-class ship, Utopia of the Seas . The first Icon-class ship, Icon of the Seas, is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2023 and enter service in the first quarter of 2024, and the second and third Icon-class ships, are expected to be delivered in the second quarters of 2025 and 2026, respectively. Utopia of the Seas is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024. \n\nCelebrity Cruises \n\nCelebrity Cruises is positioned within the luxury segment of the cruise vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises&#8217; strategy is to target affluent consumers by delivering a destination-rich experience on upscale ships that offer, among other things, culinary excellence, world-class service, luxurious spaces and accommodations, and holistic wellness experiences. Celebrity Cruises offers a range of itineraries to destinations, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, the Panama Canal and South America, with cruise lengths ranging from three to 18 nights. \n\nCelebrity Cruises operates 15 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 32,465 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, Celebrity Cruises had one Edge-class ship on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. This ship, Celebrity Ascent , is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l&#8217;Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship with capacity of approximately 3,250 berths, estimated for delivery in 2025, if certain conditions are met. \n\nSilversea Cruises \n\nSilversea Cruises is an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line with smaller ships, high standards of accommodations, fine dining, personalized service and exotic itineraries. Silversea Cruises delivers distinctive destination experiences by visiting unique and remote destinations, including the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica and the Arctic with cruise itineraries generally ranging from five to 24 nights. \n\nSilversea Cruises operates 11 ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 4,150 berths, including the brand's newest ship, Silver Endeavour , which was acquired in the third quarter of 2022 and commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, Silversea Cruises had on order two ships of a new generation, known as the Evolution-class, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths, which are expected to be delivered in the second quarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively. \n\nThe expected delivery dates for all of our ships on order are subject to change in the event of shipyard construction delays or in the event we agree to scope changes which impact the delivery timelines. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on shipyard operations. \n\nOur Partner Brands \n\nOur Global Brands are complemented by our interest in TUIC, our 50%-owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). \n\nTUIC is a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by TUI AG, a German tourism company, which is designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the German cruise market by offering products tailored for German guests. All onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to suit the preferences of this target market. \n\nTUI Cruises operates seven ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 17,700 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, TUI Cruises had three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 11,100 berths, that are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024, the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2026, respectively. \n\nHapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and three smaller expedition ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,590 berths. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises did not have any ships on order as of December 31, 2022. \n\nRefer to Note 7 . Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details. \n\nIndustry \n\nThe cruising industry has been considered a well-established vacation sector in the North American, European and Australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets. We believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice due to its inherent value, extensive itineraries and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities. The Company and other industry participants voluntarily suspended operations in March of 2020 and gradually resumed full operations starting in the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022. As a result, comparative information regarding market penetration and other indicators are not meaningful for 2020, 2021, and 2022. For the five year period prior to 2020, industry data indicated that market penetration rates were still low and that a significant portion of cruise \n\nguests carried in those years were first-time cruisers. We believe this presents an opportunity for operational and financial recovery and long-term growth for the industry. \n\nDuring the five year period from 2015 through 2019, industry market penetration rates (computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population) grew from 3.36% to 3.89% for North America, from 1.25% to 1.41% for Europe, and from 0.08% to 0.20% for Asia/Pacific. The increased penetration shows the continued growth potential in the markets most served by the industry. \n\nThe global cruise fleet was served by a weighted average of approximately 634,000 berths during 2022 with approximately 359 ships at the end of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 63 ships on order with an estimated 143,000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market through 2028, not taking into account ships taken out of service or ordered during these periods. Cruise ships in the industry were taken out of service at an accelerated rate and new ship orders were deferred due to global cruise operation restrictions in 2020 and limited sailings in 2021 and 2022 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The global cruise industry carried approximately 30 million cruise guests in 2019 and approximately 28.5 million in 2018. \n\nThe following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the percentage of North American, European and Asia/Pacific cruise guests for 2022 and for each of the five years from 2015 through 2019: \n\n##TABLE_START Year (1) \n\nWeighted-Average \n\nSupply of \n\nBerths \n\nMarketed \n\nGlobally (2) \n\nRoyal Caribbean Group Total Berths (3) \n\nNorth American Cruise Guests (2)(4) \n\nEuropean Cruise Guests (2)(5) \n\nAsia/Pacific Cruise Guests (2)(6) \n\nOther Cruise Guests (2) \n\n2015 469,000 112,700 52% 29% 14% 5% 2016 493,000 123,270 51% 27% 19% 3% 2017 515,000 124,070 48% 25% 20% 7% 2018 546,000 135,520 49% 26% 20% 5% 2019 579,000 141,570 47% 25% 24% 4% 2022 634,000 150,005 65% 28% 2% 5% ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1) Historically, we have reported annual information for comparability across periods. The 2020 suspension of global cruise operations as a result of COVID-19 and the gradual resumption of full operations starting in the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022 do not allow for a meaningful comparison to prior years' information and, as such, 2020 and 2021 data has been excluded from this table. \n\n(2) Source: The estimates of the number of global cruise guests and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources. We use data obtained from Seatrade Insider, Cruise Industry News and company press releases to estimate weighted-average supply of berths and CLIA and G.P. Wild to estimate cruise guest information. For 2022, cruise guest information includes data through the third quarter of 2022. In addition, our estimates incorporate our own analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base. \n\n(3) Total berths include our berths related to our Global Brands and Partner Brands. \n\n(4) Our estimates include the United States and Canada. \n\n(5) Our estimates include European countries relevant to the industry (most notably: the Nordics, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). \n\n(6) Our estimates include Southeast Asia (most notably: Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines), East Asia (pre-2022, most notably: China and Japan), South Asia (most notably: India) and Oceania (most notably: Australia and New Zealand) regions. The decrease in Asia/Pacific cruise guests from 2019 to 2022 is partly driven by China remaining closed given its continued COVID-19 restrictions. \n\nCompetition \n\nWe compete with a number of cruise lines and other land-based vacations. Our principal competitors are Carnival Corporation &#38; plc, which owns, among other brands, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&#38;O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; Norwegian \n\nCruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises; and Virgin Voyages. Cruise lines also compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels, internet-based alternative lodging sites and sightseeing destinations for consumers&#8217; leisure time. \n\nOperating Strategies \n\nOur mission is to deliver the best vacation experiences to our guests, responsibly. We continue to prioritize operating strategies that support this mission as well as operating strategies that support our financial recovery and the further enhancement of our financial results and liquidity. We strive to execute these strategies in a socially and environmentally responsible manner, working with our various business and community partners as we build toward a more sustainable cruise industry. \n\nOur Company's operating strategies are as follows: \n\n&#8226; deliver the best vacation experiences to our guests, responsibly; \n\n&#8226; protect the health, safety and security of our guests and employees; \n\n&#8226; deepen our customer relationships in order to enhance our revenues; \n\n&#8226; focus on cost efficiency, adequate cash and liquidity, and strengthen our balance sheet, with the overall goals of maximizing our return on invested capital and shareholder value; \n\n&#8226; protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate, with a focus on decarbonization; \n\n&#8226; invest in our workforce in order to better serve our global guest base and grow our business, and promote gender equality, diversity and inclusion; \n\n&#8226; increase the awareness and market penetration of our brands globally; \n\n&#8226; strategically invest in our fleet through the upgrade and maintenance of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations, while prudently expanding our fleet with new state-of-the-art cruise ships; \n\n&#8226; capitalize on the portability and flexibility of our ships by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns, while continuing our focus on existing key markets; \n\n&#8226; provide extraordinary destination experiences and state-of-the-art port facilities to our guests; \n\n&#8226; continue to deploy technology capabilities and advanced uses of data and analytics to deliver innovative customer experiences as well as to create operational efficiencies that enhance employee satisfaction; and \n\n&#8226; maintain strong relationships with travel advisors, while enhancing our consumer outreach and e-commerce programs \n\nSafety, security and health policies \n\nWe are committed to protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and others working on our behalf. Our efforts in these areas are managed by several departments within the Company that are responsible for maritime safety, global security, environmental stewardship and medical/public health activities. We also have a dedicated committee of our Board of Directors, the Safety, Environment, Sustainability and Health Committee, which is responsible for reviewing and monitoring our overall strategies, policies and programs that impact the safety and health of our guests and crew. Refer to the Regulation - Safety and Security Regulations section below for further information. \n\nConsumer engagement \n\nWe place a strong focus on identifying the needs of our guests and creating product features and innovations that our customers value. We are focused on targeting and acquiring high-value guests by better understanding consumer data and insights to create communication strategies that resonate with our target audiences. \n\nWe target customers at important consumer decision points and identify underlying needs for which guests are willing to pay a premium. We rely on various programs and technologies during the cruise-planning, cruising and after-cruise periods aimed at increasing ticket prices, onboard revenues and occupancy. We have and expect to strategically invest in projects on our ships that we believe drive marketability, profitability and improve the guest experience. \n\nFocus on cost efficiency, capital allocation, adequate cash and liquidity and improving our balance sheet \n\nWe are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile, while making progress towards achieving an unsecured balance sheet, obtaining cost efficiencies including lowering interest expense, and reducing leverage. For example, in early 2023, we extended our revolving credit facility with our key relationship banks to ensure adequate liquidity on a going-forward basis. We believe these strategies enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value. \n\nProtect the environment \n\nWe are focused on the environmental health of the marine environment and communities in which we operate. This includes our Destination Net Zero strategy, and our partnership with the World Wildlife Fund, which together aim to reduce our carbon footprint, raise awareness about ocean conservation among guests and crew, and support ocean conservation projects around the world. \n\nDestination Net Zero is our decarbonization strategy that focuses on how to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and deliver a net zero capable ship by 2035. This strategy also includes achieving reductions on our carbon intensity by double digits by 2025, compared to 2019. Destination Net Zero&#8217;s four-pronged approach includes the modernization of our global brands fleet through the introduction of new energy-efficient and alternatively fueled vessels, continued investment in energy efficiency programs, development of alternative fuel and alternative power solutions, and optimized deployment and integration of strategic shore-based supply chains. While we continue to develop our roadmap to Destination Net Zero, it is already clear that our strategy will require new fuels and technologies that are not available today. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - &#8220; Our sustainability activities, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, could result in reputational risks, increased costs and other risks &#8221; for a discussion of the risks associated with our environmental initiatives. \n\nOur long-term partnership with the World Wildlife Fund focuses on greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") reduction strategies, sustainable sourcing of food supplies, waste management, sustainable destinations and guest education on ocean conservation issues, which supports onboard conservation efforts such as our reduced use of plastics. We are also committed to assessing and managing potential impacts related to our operations in the communities in which we operate. \n\nTo achieve our carbon intensity goals, we have invested and plan to continue investing in energy and carbon efficient technologies included in the design of our new vessels, our ongoing fleet energy management program and other technologies. These investments include installation costs related to advanced emissions purification systems (\"AEP\") and other technologies that are expected to reduce fuel consumption and carbon footprint. \n\nWe believe in transparent reporting on our environmental and sustainability stewardship, as well as our social and governance efforts, and have annually published a Sustainability Report since 2008. This report, the current version of which is accessible on our corporate website, highlights our progress with regards to those environmental, social and governance aspects of our business that we believe are most significant to our organization and stakeholders. In addition to providing an overview on our sustainability efforts, the report references the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative and is aligned with the Sustainable Accounting Standards Boards Industry Standards for Cruise Lines. We continue to work on an initial report following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which we plan to file in 2023. Our corporate website also provides information about our environmental performance goals and sustainability initiatives. The foregoing information contained on our website is not part of any of these reports and is not incorporated by reference herein or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Refer to the Regulation - Environmental Regulations section below for further information. \n\nInvesting in our workforce and promoting equality, diversity and inclusion \n\nWe believe that our employees, both shipboard and shoreside, are a critical success factor for our business. We strive to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain the best employees, who provide our guests with extraordinary vacations. Our ability to attract, engage, and retain key employees has been and will remain critical to our success. Our Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the Company's human capital management strategies, including initiatives for talent diversity, equity and inclusion, talent management, and corporate culture. \n\nWe focus on providing our employees with a competitive compensation structure, development opportunities, and other personal and professional growth opportunities in order to strengthen and support our human capital. We also select, develop and have strategies to retain high performing leaders to advance the enterprise now and in the future. To that end, we pay special attention to identifying high performing potential leaders and developing bench strength so these leaders can assume leadership roles throughout the organization. \n\nWe strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation, and believe that maintaining a strong employee-focused culture is beneficial to the growth and expansion of our business. We foster diversity and inclusion among our broad employee base. Refer to the Human Capital section below for further information. \n\nGlobal awareness and market penetration \n\nWe increase brand awareness and market penetration of our cruise brands in various ways, including the use of communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to emphasize the qualities of each brand, especially among target groups. Our marketing strategies include the use of travel advisors, traditional media, mobile and digital media as well as social media, influencers and brand websites. Our brands engage past and potential guests by collaborating with travel partners and through call centers, international offices and international representatives. In addition, our Global Brands target repeat guests with exclusive benefits offered through their respective loyalty programs. \n\nWe sell and market our Global Brands to guests outside of the United States and Canada through the combined efforts of internationally focused internal resources and a network of independent international representatives located throughout the world. While the majority of our guests for our Global Brands come from North America, we also sell and market our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of North America by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests. In addition, we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets. \n\nRefer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - &#8220; Conducting business globally results in increased costs and other risks&#8221; for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations. \n\nDelivery of state-of-the-art cruise ships, and fleet upgrade and maintenance \n\nWe place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our existing fleet, such as large-scale atriums, double hulls for increased safety, and advanced steel structures. We are expanding our innovation efforts to cover multiple fronts, including naval and architectural design, guest facing features, energy efficiency, sustainability, and safety. \n\nWe are committed to building state-of-the-art ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage. Our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient and environmentally friendly to operate than older vessels. \n\nIn 2023, we will introduce three new vessels to our fleet, including Royal Caribbean International&#8217;s new flagship &#8211; Icon of the Seas , Celebrity Cruises &#8211; Celebrity Ascent , and Silversea Cruises &#8211; Silver Nova . Each of these vessels will represent the latest hardware for their respective brands and both Icon of the Seas and Silver Nova are the first vessels of a new class. For Royal Caribbean International, new features on Icon of the Seas include a dedicated family neighborhood called &#8220;Surfside&#8221;, a pool deck featuring the largest swimming pool and waterpark at sea, and the &#8220;Aquadome&#8221; showcasing the tallest waterfall at sea in an 82-foot-tall dome. For Celebrity Cruises, Celebrity Ascent will represent an evolution of Celebrity Beyond and will build on the success that the Edge series of ships has brought to market. For Silversea, Silver Nova will be amongst our most environmentally friendly and energy efficient ships to date. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Global Brands and Partner Brands have 10 ships on order. Refer to the Operations section below for further information on our ships on order. As we further develop our Newbuild program, we continue to utilize each vessel as an opportunity to pilot new technology towards Destination Net Zero. \n\nIn addition, we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships, purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet while ensuring that we remain focused on the returns we generate on invested capital and maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and operating leverage. \n\nMarkets and itineraries \n\nIn an effort to penetrate untapped markets, diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions, we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new, and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world. The portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing and new cruise markets. We make deployment decisions generally 18 to 28 months in advance, with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio. Additionally, the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world, which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries. \n\nOur ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on over 1,000 destinations in over 120 countries, spanning across all seven continents. We are focused on maximizing long-term shareholder returns by operating in established \n\nmarkets while growing our presence in developing markets. New capacity has allowed our brands to expand into new markets and itineraries in an effort to address changes in market demand. \n\nDestination experiences and port facilities \n\nIn order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests, we have and continue to invest in our private land destinations. In 2018, we announced our Perfect Day Island Collection, an initiative to develop a series of private island destinations around the world. The first island in the collection, Perfect Day at CocoCay, opened in Spring 2019 and includes a wide range of attractions, such as a full water park, zip line course, freshwater pools, helium balloon ride, splash pads and a beach club. In 2023, we plan to expand Perfect Day at CocoCay with the delivery of Hideaway Beach, an elevated, adults-only experience. Additionally, we are planning to introduce a new product, our Royal Beach Club offering, which will offer an exclusive and branded experience at high volume ports. As a result of the operational disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we delayed previously announced Perfect Day site openings and are reassessing their timing as well as the timing of our Royal Beach Club offering portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to develop additional destinations across the globe. \n\nIn an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships, and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests, we have actively assisted or invested in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure, including mixed-use commercial properties, located in strategic ports of call, and reduction of our environmental impacts. For instance, in November 2022, we opened in Galveston, Texas our new Net Zero homeport cruise terminal, the first cruise terminal facility to generate 100% of its needed energy through on-site solar panels. \n\nGenerally, we collaborate with local, private or governmental entities by providing management and/or financial assistance and often enter into long-term port usage arrangements. Our participation in these efforts is most often accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority and/or various other strategic partnerships established to develop and/or operate the port facilities, by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances, by providing direct or indirect financial support. In exchange for our involvement, we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships. \n\nTechnological capabilities \n\nTechnology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our operating strategies and provide a quality experience to our customers before, during and after their cruise. Technology also plays a critical role in the measures and protocols that we have developed and will continue operating on our cruise ships. For example, through the deployment of our innovative electronic safety drill (\"Muster 2.0\") program, we have added convenience, and improved our guests experience regarding the mandatory safety briefing. \n\nWe have continued to integrate digital capabilities into our operations and have increased our focus in bringing in data analytics and artificial intelligence into our processes to provide better insights on how to model our maintenance or operational actions. Also, we continue to develop tools to enhance our guests' digital experience and grow onboard revenue, by making it easier for our guests to plan and maximize their next vacation through our websites and apps. At the same time, we partnered with SpaceX to launch Starlink, the next generation in shipboard connectivity, unlocking an improved guest experience. In concert with our destination focus, our island technology solutions are now enabling our guests to remain connected with WiFi access, order food and beverages as well as take advantage of all the island based activities with the same ease as onboard our ships. \n\nInvestments in our core platforms, as well as the trade and direct distribution channels, are delivering the benefit of more modernized solutions with scalability and faster self-service response times while also deploying new features such as flight packages and additional promotional offer capabilities. \n\nCyber security and data privacy are an ongoing focus, and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data, intellectual property and global operations. \n\nTravel advisor support, consumer outreach, and e-commerce \n\nTravel advisors continue to be a significant sourcing channel of revenues for our ships. We believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners. To accomplish this goal, we seek to maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures with the marketplace. We continuously work with travel advisors to sell upgrades and add-ons such as air and pre-cruise purchases to improve the retention and profitability \n\nof the channel. We provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as consultants to our travel partners. We also provide trained customer service representatives, call centers and online training tools. \n\nWe continue to operate our Consumer Outreach department, which provides consumers 24-hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers, as well as invest in our websites, including mobile applications and mobile websites. We enable our guests to communicate and book with us through various channels such as phone, web, chat, text message, and/or email. Additionally, we continue to advance our e-commerce capabilities and the vacation shopping experience for our guests. In addition to offering a simplified booking experience, we leverage the mobile application for onboard experiences such as WiFi, beverages, shore excursions, and specialty dining &#8211; enabling guests to book their vacation end-to-end. \n\nGuest Services \n\nWe offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, including facilitating guest pre- and post-hotel stay arrangements and air transportation. \n\nRoyal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises offer recognition and status upgrades to their guests through their loyalty programs, Crown &#38; Anchor Society, Captain&#8217;s Club, and Venetian Society, respectively, to encourage repeat business. Crown &#38; Anchor Society has approximately 17.8 million members worldwide. Captain&#8217;s Club and Venetian Society have approximately 5.4 million members combined worldwide. Members are awarded points or credits in proportion to the number of cruise days and stateroom category. The loyalty programs provide tiers of membership benefits which entitle guests to upgraded experiences and recognition relative to the status achieved once the guests have accumulated the number of cruise points or credits specified for each tier.

Two ships on order are being built in Germany by Meyer Werft GmbH, four are being built in Finland by Meyer Turku shipyard, two are being built in France by Chantiers de l&#8217;Atlantique and two are being built in Italy by Fincantieri. As of December 31, 2022, the dates that the ships on order are expected to be delivered, subject to change in the event of construction delays, and their approximate berths are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Ship Shipyard Expected Delivery Approximate Berths Royal Caribbean International &#8212; &#160; &#160; Oasis-class: &#160; &#160; Utopia of the Seas Chantiers de l&#8217;Atlantique 2nd Quarter 2024 5,700 Icon-class: Icon of the Seas Meyer Turku Oy 4th Quarter 2023 5,600 Unnamed Meyer Turku Oy 2nd Quarter 2025 5,600 Unnamed Meyer Turku Oy 2nd Quarter 2026 5,600 Celebrity Cruises &#8212; Edge-class: Celebrity Ascent Chantiers de l&#8217;Atlantique 4th Quarter 2023 3,250 Silversea Cruises &#8212; Evolution-class: Silver Nova Meyer Werft 2nd Quarter 2023 730 Silver Ray Meyer Werft 2nd Quarter 2024 730 TUI Cruises (50% joint venture) &#8212; &#160; &#160; Mein Schiff 7 Meyer Turku Oy 2nd Quarter 2024 2,900 Unnamed Fincantieri 4th Quarter 2024 4,100 Unnamed Fincantieri 2nd Quarter 2026 4,100 Total Berths 38,310 ##TABLE_END\n\n__________________________________________________________________ \n\nIn addition, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l&#8217;Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing. \n\nSeasonality \n\nOur revenues have historically been seasonal based on the demand for cruises. Demand is typically strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere&#8217;s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have focused on deployment in the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period. \n\nPassengers and Capacity \n\nSelected statistical information is shown in the following table (see Financial Presentation - Description of Certain Line Items and Selected Operational and Financial Metrics under Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , for definitions). Passengers Carried, Passenger Cruise Days, Available Passenger Cruise Days and Occupancy reflect the impact of our suspension of operations during parts of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the gradual resumption of full operations starting the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (3) 2022 2021 (1)(3) 2020 (2) 2019 (2) 2018 (2) Passengers Carried 5,536,335 1,030,403 1,295,144 6,553,865 6,084,201 Passenger Cruise Days 35,051,935 5,802,582 8,697,893 44,803,953 41,853,052 Available Passenger Cruise Days (APCD) 41,197,650 11,767,441 8,539,903 41,432,451 38,425,304 Occupancy 85.1% 49.3% 101.9% 108.1% 108.9% ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1) Due to the elimination of the Silversea Cruises three-month reporting lag in October of 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 and October 1 through December 31, 2021 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The year ended December 31, 2021 does not include July, August, and September 2021 statistics as Silversea Cruises' results of operations for those months are included within Other (expense) income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 1 . General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the three-month reporting lag. \n\n(2) Due to the three-month reporting lag effective through September 30, 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020 in the year ended December 31, 2020, from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019 in the year ended December 31, 2019, and from August 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018 in the year ended December 31, 2018. \n\n(3) For the year ended December, 31, 2021, we include Azamara Cruises' metrics through March 19, 2021, the effective sale date of the brand. Refer to Note 1 . General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the sale of the Azamara Cruises brand. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we include the full year of operations for Azamara Cruises. \n\nCruise Pricing \n\nOur cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. Prices vary depending on many factors including the destination, cruise length, stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place. \n\nAlthough we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the United States, our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the sailing. Our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing. During the selling period of a cruise, we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand, with the objective of maximizing net yields. \n\nAs our business has grown globally, our sale arrangements with travel advisors may vary. For instance, although our direct business has historically grown at a rapid pace, sale arrangements through travel advisor charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the China market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales. \n\nWe have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities, making it easier to do business with us. For example, we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world. \n\nPassenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 66%, 61% and 68% of total revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nOnboard Activities and Other Revenues \n\nOur cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services, amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship. While many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise, we realize additional revenues from, among other things, gaming, the sale of alcoholic and other beverages, internet and other telecommunication services, gift shop items, shore excursions, photography, spa/salon and fitness services, art auctions, retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options. Many of these services are available for pre-booking prior to embarkation. These activities are offered either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues. The all-inclusive pricing programs that we offer currently, add some of these onboard activity and other services to the base price of the cruise. \n\nIn conjunction with our cruise vacations, we offer pre- and post-cruise hotel packages to our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises guests. We also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets, which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation, medical protection and baggage protection. Onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 34%, 39%, and 32% of total revenues in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nSegment Reporting \n\nWe believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our Global \n\nBrands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our President and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the Company as one segment. ( For financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .) \n\nHuman Capital \n\nOur human capital strategy focuses on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in the industry. Some key elements of these strategies include: assessing current and future talent needs; a diverse and inclusive workforce; robust opportunities for employee growth and development; support for health and well-being; and an active listening strategy to make sure voices are heard and continuous improvement occurs. We review our human capital metrics and our diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) program with the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our three global cruise brands employed approximately 102,500 employees spanning across our shipboard fleet and shoreside locations. Our shoreside workforce, including private destinations, consisted of approximately 8,100 full time and 100 part-time employees. Our shipboard workforce consisted of 94,300 employees, and as of December 31, 2022, approximately 88% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. \n\nThe following table details the distribution of our workforce by employee type and region as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Employee Type U.S. Based Employees International Employees \n\nShoreside Operations (1) \n\n4,100 3,000 Shipboard Employees &#8212; 94,300 \n\nPrivate Destinations (2) \n\n&#8212; 1,100 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes full time and part-time employees. \n\n(2) Private Destinations includes Coco Cay, Labadee and Galapagos based employees. \n\nAs a global operation, we take great pride in the broad diversity of our workforce and the value it brings to our company. Our shoreside workforce is gender diverse with 58% female representation. Our shipboard workforce is comprised of employees from approximately 139 countries. The majority of our shipboard workforce comes from the Philippines (30%), Indonesia (18%) and India (14%). Our shoreside workforce is primarily based out of the U.S. (57%), Philippines (21%), Mexico (7%), and U.K. (5%). \n\nThe following table details the gender distribution of our workforce by employee location as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Employee Location Male Female Shoreside - U.S. 44% 56% Shoreside - International 41% 59% Shipboard 78% 22% ##TABLE_END\n\nOur U.S. shoreside workforce is ethnically diverse with approximately 55% comprised of non-White ethnic groups. \n\n##TABLE_START U.S. Shoreside Representation by Ethnicity % of Total U.S. Shoreside Population White 42% Hispanic 40% African American 9% Asian 5% \n\nOthers (1) \n\n4% ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) No other individual category is greater than 1%. \n\nWe offer a variety of learning and development programs to our workforce, which includes a combination of instructor led (classroom and virtual) and web based (self-learning) courses. In 2022, our workforce invested approximately 2.5 million hours in learning programs across a variety of areas ranging from Ethics, Compliance, Data Analysis, Business Software and Tools, Finance/Accounting, Professional development, Project Management skills, Cyber Security, Leadership and Safety/Security. In total, our workforce completed approximately 1.2 million courses within our learning management systems. \n\nWe run our employee pulse surveys periodically to understand and positively impact our employees&#8217; experience. In 2022, our shoreside employee engagement scores remained high and above most global industry benchmarks. \n\nInsurance \n\nWe maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship. This coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the British, Scandinavian, French, United States and other reputable international insurance markets. \n\nWe are members of four Protection and Indemnity (\"P&#38;I\") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 12 P&#38;I clubs, known as the International Group of P&#38;I Clubs (the &#8220;IG&#8221;). Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&#38;I clubs, subject to the clubs&#8217; rules and the limits of coverage determined by the IG. P&#38;I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 12 P&#38;I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers. \n\nWe maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and hijacking. Our primary war risk coverage is provided by a Norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four P&#38;I clubs. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk. In the event of a war between major powers, our primary policies terminate after thirty days&#8217; notice and our excess policies terminate immediately. Our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk. These notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk. \n\nInsurance coverage for other exposures, such as shoreside property and casualty, passenger off-vessel, directors and officers and network security and privacy, are maintained with various global insurance companies. \n\nWe do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place, as compared to the cost of insurance. \n\nAll insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels. In addition, in certain circumstances, we either self-insure or co-insure a portion of these risks. Premiums charged by insurance carriers, including carriers in the maritime insurance industry, increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature. These cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets. We historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future, particularly for war risk insurance. \n\nTrademarks \n\nWe own a number of registered trademarks related to the Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises cruise brands. The registered trademarks include the name &#8220;Royal Caribbean International&#8221; and its crown and anchor logo, the name &#8220;Celebrity Cruises&#8221; and its &#8220;X&#8221; logo, the name &#8220;Silversea Cruises&#8221; and its logo, and the names of various cruise ships, ship venues and other marketing programs. We believe our largest brands' trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \n\nRegulation \n\nOur ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, our ships are registered in the Bahamas, Cyprus, Malta or in the case of our ships operating in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below. Ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations. Additionally, ships operating out of the United States ports are subject to inspection by the United States Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary and health conditions. Our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit. \n\nWe believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the United States and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be implemented that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. \n\nSafety and Security Regulations \n\nOur ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (&#8220;SOLAS&#8221;), which, among other things, establish requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships for guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and incorporated in our ship design and operation, as applicable. The latest enhancements include the addition of the Polar Code which sets goal-based standards for ships operating in the polar region as well as damage stability requirements for new designs and operational measures for existing vessels. Compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code (&#8220;ISM Code&#8221;), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators. \n\nAll of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities, and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ISM Code. \n\nAdditionally, we are required to meet, and we fully comply with, the provisions outlined in the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). This convention sets the training and competency standards for all our crew who are responsible for operating the vessels or who have designated roles in ensuring the safety of our guests and crew during an emergency. Regulatory bodies routinely check that our crews&#8217; training credentials are up-to-date and assess competency by observing safety and emergency drills. As amendments are made to STCW, we ensure that our crew training is updated accordingly. \n\nOur ships are subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (&#8220;ISPS Code&#8221;), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (&#8220;MTSA&#8221;), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports. In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments, and develop security plans. The security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the Recognized Security Organization on behalf of the ships' flag state and are in compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA. \n\nThe Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the United States, requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of \n\npractices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime. The cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires. Some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized. We do not expect the pending regulations to have a material impact to our operations. \n\nEnvironmental Regulations \n\nWe are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs. We believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and, accordingly, may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future, including the items described below. \n\nOur ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization&#8217;s (&#8216;&#8216;IMO&#8217;&#8217;) regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the &#8216;&#8216;MARPOL Regulations&#8217;&#8217;) and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (Ballast Water Management Convention), in addition to other regional and national regulations such as EU Directives and the US Vessel General Permit, which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage, air emissions and the transfer of non-native/non-indigenous species. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage, air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships. \n\nEmissions \n\nThe MARPOL Regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 0.5% as of January 1, 2020, which was reduced from 3.5%. We do not expect for this increased limitation to have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years, including equipping all of our new ships delivered since 2014 with Advanced Emissions Purification (\"AEP\") systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing AEP systems on the majority of our remaining fleet; resulting in 70% of our fleet being equipped with AEP systems. In addition, the majority of our ships on order are being delivered with Liquified Natural Gas (\"LNG\") technology that meet all sulfur requirements. These efforts will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility. \n\nThe MARPOL Regulations also establish special Emission Control Areas (\"ECAs\") with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in certain geographical areas. There are four established ECAs and one additional ECA being established beginning in May of 2025 that restrict sulfur emissions: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the \"Caribbean ECA\") and the Mediterranean Sea. Ships operating in these sulfur ECAs are required to reduce their emissions sulfur content to 0.1%. This reduction has not, and with the addition of the new ECA will not, have a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above. \n\nAdditionally, all new ships operating within the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA that began construction on or after January 1, 2016, and North and Baltic Sea ships constructed on or after January 1, 2021 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits. We comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service. As an added measure, all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules. The rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs. \n\nBeginning in 2018 and 2019, respectively, the European Union (EU) and IMO both implemented requirements for ships to monitor and report their carbon emissions. Compliance with these regulations have not materially impacted our costs or results of operations. However, the legislations contemplate the enactment of further obligations and restrictions focused on reducing carbon emissions from ships. The EU has proposed a series of significant carbon reforms under its Fit for 55 package designed to meet its 2030 emission goals, which would require us, among other things, to increase the use of low carbon fuel onboard our vessels, connectivity to shore power, and to purchase carbon allowances. The Fit for 55 Package includes proposals for the EU Emission Trading System (ETS), and the FuelEU Maritime initiative. The ETS&#8217;s current proposed structure will subject ship operators to the program, and will impose requirements to purchase carbon emission allowances beginning in 2024 for 40% of our emissions within Europe, growing to 70% in 2025, and to 100% by 2026. The FuelEU Maritime initiative, still under development, currently proposes requirements on fuel mix of 2-6% lower carbon fuels beginning in 2024 to 2026 and connecting to shore power by 2030. If enacted, the Fit for 55 proposals could individually and collectively have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to increased costs \n\nassociated with compliance and modified itineraries in the affected regions. The impact of the regulation is uncertain as elements of the proposals have not been finalized and the costs of ETS allowances will depend on future markets. \n\nIn November of 2020, IMO approved amendments to the MARPOL convention that will require ships, beginning in 2023, to combine a technical and an operational approach (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (\"EEXI\") and Carbon Intensity Indicator (\"CII\")) to reduce their carbon intensity in line with the ambition of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40% by 2030 as compared to 2008. The approved framework for the EEXI and CII amendments are not expected to have a material impact on our operations, however IMO is expected to review the CII framework in 2026, which could result in further requirements which could lead to changes to our itinerary flexibility for some of our ships depending on the final operational measures needed to comply. Furthermore, the IMO is also considering various other measures, including a possible fuel standard or a global market-based measures, such as carbon taxes, that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions even further. While the exact impact is uncertain at this time as the proposals have yet to be finalized, the global nature of the regulation could result in increased compliance costs. We will continue to monitor and be engaged in the discussions. \n\nBallast Water \n\nThe IMO Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into effect in 2017, requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing Ballast Water Treatment Systems by 2023. Compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations. \n\nRefer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Environmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs\" for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above . \n\nConsumer Financial Responsibility Regulations \n\nWe are required to obtain certificates from the United States Federal Maritime Commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of non-performance of obligations to guests, as well as casualty and personal injury. As a condition to obtaining the required certificates, we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our ship-operating companies. The required amount of the surety bonds for non-performance of obligations to guests is currently $32 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments. \n\nWe are also required by the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the non-performance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom we are currently required by the Association of British Travel Agents to provide performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year, up to &#163;154 million during the peak season. Additionally, we are required by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide performance bonds totaling &#163;35 million. We maintain with the Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Baltics. \n\nCertain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the non-performance of our obligations; however, the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs. \n\nTaxation of the Company \n\nThe following is a summary of our principal taxes, exemptions and special regimes. In addition to or instead of income taxation, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee, or both, based on guest headcount, tonnage or some other measure. We also collect and remit value added tax (VAT) or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate. \n\nOur consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation. \n\nU.S. Income Taxation \n\nThe following is a discussion of the application of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, court decisions and the relevant state tax laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations. All of the foregoing is subject to change, and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion. \n\nApplication of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code \n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises, Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and many of our ship-owning subsidiaries, depending upon the itineraries of their ships, receive income from sources within the United States. Silversea Cruises Ltd. and our United Kingdom tonnage tax company are classified as disregarded entities, or divisions for U.S. federal income tax purposes that may earn U.S. source income. Under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income (and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits) U.S. source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships. \n\nA foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States; and (2) the stock of the corporation (or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof) is &#8220;primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market&#8221; in the United States. In the opinion of our U.S. tax counsel, Faegre Drinker Biddle &#38; Reath LLP, based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., including Silversea Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and relevant ship-owning subsidiaries with U.S. source shipping income qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in Liberia, which is a qualifying country, and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States (i.e., we are a &#8220;publicly traded&#8221; corporation). If, in the future, (1) Liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction, and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption, or (2) we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation, we and all of our ship-owning or operating subsidiaries that rely on Section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their U.S. source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto. \n\nWe believe that most of our income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and, therefore, is exempt from taxation under Section 883. \n\nRegulations under Section 883 list activities that are not considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise tours. Our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the United States will be subject to U.S. taxation. \n\nTaxation in the Absence of an Exemption Under Section 883 \n\nIf Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the operator of our vessels, Celebrity Cruises Inc., or our ship-owning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the provision was repealed, then, as explained below, such companies would be subject to U.S. income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships. \n\nBecause Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Celebrity Cruises Inc. conduct a trade or business in the United States, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., including Silversea Cruises Ltd., and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income (i.e., without regard to the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries) on income which is effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business (generally only income from U.S. sources). In addition, if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business were withdrawn, or were deemed to have been withdrawn, from our U.S. trade or business, those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a &#8220;branch profits&#8221; tax at the rate of 30%. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which includes Silversea Cruises Ltd. for tax purposes, and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30%. \n\nIf Section 883 were not available to our ship-owning subsidiaries, each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4% tax on its U.S. source gross transportation income, if any, each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the United States and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship. \n\nOther United States Taxation \n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which includes Silversea Cruises Ltd., and Celebrity Cruises Inc. earn U.S. source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping. The tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented. \n\nState Taxation \n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state&#8217;s portion of the U.S. source income subject to federal income taxes. Additionally, the state of Alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in Alaska and certain other affiliated companies to Alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33% tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in Alaska waters. This did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented. \n\nUnited Kingdom Income Taxation \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we operated 15 ships under the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime (&#8220;U.K. tonnage tax&#8221;). \n\nCompanies subject to U.K. tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels. The requirements for a company to qualify for the U.K. tonnage tax regime include being subject to U.K. corporate income tax, operating qualifying ships, which are strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom, and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement. \n\nRelevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. Our U.K. income from non-shipping activities which do not qualify under the U.K. tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant, remain subject to regular U.K. corporate income tax. \n\nOther Taxation \n\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to value-added and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable, zero-rated or exempt. \n\nIn December 2022, the European Union announced it would implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development&#8217;s (OECD&#8217;s) 15% Global Minimum Tax initiative (known as &#8220;Pillar 2&#8221;). If enacted, these rules generally impose a 15% corporate minimum tax on large multi-national companies, and we expect to be in scope of the rules beginning in 2025. The OECD model rules provide an exclusion for &#8220;International Shipping Income,&#8221; and certain ancillary income, for which certain of our earnings may be eligible. We are still pending final guidance on several material open technical issues and assessing the impact on our financial statements. \n\nWebsite Access to Reports \n\nWe make available, free of charge, access to our Annual Reports, all quarterly and current reports and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission through our website at www.rclinvestor.com .

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nThe risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. There may be additional risks that we consider not to be material, or which are not known, and any of these risks could affect our operations. &#160; The ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect a risk's potential likelihood or magnitude. See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements. \n\nMacroeconomic, Business, Market and Operational Risks \n\nAdverse economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending, adversely impacting our operating results, cash flows and financial condition including impairing the value of our goodwill, ships, trademarks and other assets and potentially affecting other critical accounting estimates where the impact may be material to our operating results. \n\nDemand for cruises is affected by international, national, and local economic conditions. Weak or uncertain economic conditions may impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers postpone or reduce discretionary spending. This, in turn, may result in cruise booking slowdowns, decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues. Given the global nature of our business, we are exposed to many different economies, and our business could be negatively impacted by challenging conditions in any of the markets in which we operate, and/or related reactions by our competitors in such markets. \n\nOur operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control. \n\nOur operating costs, including fuel, food, payroll and benefits, airfare, taxes, insurance, and security costs, can be and have been subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control, including global inflationary pressures, which have increased our operating costs. Increases in these operating costs have affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our future profitability. \n\nIn particular, increases in fuel prices have and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices impact not only our fuel costs, but also some of our other expenses, such as crew travel, freight, and commodity prices. Mandatory fuel restrictions may also create uncertainty related to the price and availability of certain fuel types potentially impacting operating costs. \n\nPrice increases for commercial airline services for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services and/or availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests. \n\nMany of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark. Increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests, which may adversely impact demand for our cruises. In addition, changes in the availability and/or regulations governing commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests&#8217; ability to obtain air travel, as well as our ability to transfer our guests to or from our cruise ships, which could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nTerrorist attacks, war, and other similar events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. \n\nWe are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events, including terrorist attacks, war, conflicts, civil unrest and other hostilities. The occurrence of these events or an escalation in the frequency or severity of them, and the resulting political instability, travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing, have had, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry. These events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which have, and may in the future, impact access to ports and/or destinations. In addition, such events have led, and could lead, to disruptions, instability and volatility in global markets, supply chains and industries, increased operating costs, such as fuel and food, and disruptions affecting our newbuild construction and fleet modernization efforts, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Further, such events could have the effect of heightening the other risks we have described in this report, any of which also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nDisease outbreaks and an increase in concern about the risk of illness could adversely impact our business and results of operations, and may cause significant disruptions, create new risks, and exacerbate existing risks. \n\nDisease outbreaks and increased concern related to illness when traveling to, from, and on our ships such as COVID-19 could cause a drop in demand for cruises, guest cancellations, travel restrictions, an unavailability of ports and/or destinations, cruise cancellations, ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew, provisions or supplies from certain places. In addition, we may be subject to increased concerns that cruises are more susceptible than other vacation alternatives to the spread of infectious diseases. For example, the unprecedented responses by governments and other authorities to control and contain the COVID-19 outbreak, \n\nincluding related variants, led to our voluntary suspension of our global cruise operations starting in March 2020. While we have resumed our global cruise operations, there is no assurance that our cruise operations will continue uninterrupted. In response to disease outbreaks, our industry, including our passengers and crew, may be subject to enhanced health and safety requirements in the future which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement across our fleet. For example, local governments may establish their own set of rules for self-quarantines and/or require proof of individuals' health status or vaccination prior to or upon visiting. Based on our assessment of these requirements and recommendations, or for other reasons, we may determine it necessary to cancel or modify certain of our Global Brands&#8217; cruise sailings. The impact of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, any operating or health protocols that we may develop or that may be required by law in the future in response to infectious diseases may be costly to develop and implement and may be less effective than we expected in reducing the risk of infection and spread of such disease on our cruise ships, all of which will negatively impact our operations and expose us to reputational and legal risks. \n\nIncidents on ships, at port facilities, land destinations and/or affecting the cruise vacation industry in general, and the associated negative media coverage and publicity, have affected and could continue to affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations. \n\nCruise ships, private destinations, port facilities and shore excursions operated and/or offered by us and third parties may be susceptible to the risk of accidents, illnesses, mechanical failures, environmental incidents and other incidents which could bring into question safety, health, security and vacation satisfaction and negatively impact our sales, operations and reputation. Incidents involving cruise ships, and, in particular the safety, health and security of guests and crew and the media coverage thereof, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted and could continue to impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry. In particular, we cannot predict the impact on our financial performance and the public&#8217;s concern regarding the health and safety of travel, especially by cruise ship, and related decreases in demand for travel and cruising. Moreover, our ability to attract and retain guests and crew depends, in part, upon the perception and reputation of our company and our brands and the public&#8217;s concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally, as well as regarding the cruising industry and our ships specifically. Our reputation and our business could also be damaged by continued or additional negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general, including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease such as COVID-19, over-tourism in key ports and destinations and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising. The considerable expansion in the use of social and digital media has compounded the potential scope and reach of any negative publicity. In addition, incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business, increasing government or other regulatory oversight and, in certain cases, potential litigation. \n\nSignificant weather, climate events and/or natural disasters could adversely impact our business and results of operations. \n\nNatural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, volcanos, wildfires), weather and/or climate events (including hurricanes and typhoons) could impact our source markets and operations resulting in travel restrictions, guest cancellations, an inability to source our crew or our provisions and supplies from certain places. We are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, operating costs and profitability in the current and future periods. Increases in the frequency, severity or duration of these types of events could exacerbate their impact and disrupt our operations or make certain destinations less desirable or unavailable impacting our revenues and profitability further. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance. \n\nOur sustainability activities, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, could result in reputational risks, increased costs and other risks. \n\nCustomers, investors, lenders, regulators and other industry stakeholders have placed increasing importance on corporate ESG practices and on the implications and social cost of their investments, which could cause us to incur additional costs and changes to our operations. If our ESG practices or disclosures do not meet stakeholders' evolving expectations and standards, our customer and employee retention, our access to certain types of capital, including export credit financing, and our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted, which could affect our business operations and financial condition. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices, which could increase our operating costs and affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nIn addition, from time to time, we communicate certain initiatives regarding climate change and other ESG matters. We could fail or be perceived to fail to achieve such initiatives, which may negatively affect our reputation. The future adoption of new technology or processes to achieve the initiatives could also result in the impairment of existing assets. \n\nOur reliance on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which could adversely impact our business. \n\nWe rely on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair, maintain, and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner. There are a limited number of shipyards with the capability \n\nand capacity to build, repair, maintain and/or upgrade our ships. As such, any disruptions affecting the newbuild or fleet modernization supply chain will adversely impact our business as there are limited substitutes. \n\nSuspensions and/or slowdowns of work at shipyards, have impacted and could continue to impact our ability to construct new ships as planned, our ability to timely and cost-effectively procure new capacity, and our ability to execute scheduled drydocks and/or fleet modernizations. For instance, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the shipyards, their subcontractors, and our suppliers have resulted in delays in our previously scheduled ship deliveries. Variations from our plan could have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial condition. \n\nBuilding, repairing, maintaining and/or upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks. Material increases in commodity and raw material prices, and other cost pressures impacting the construction of a new ship, such as the cost of labor and financing, could adversely impact the shipyard&#8217;s ability to build the ship on a cost-effective basis. We may be impacted if shipyards, their subcontractors, and/or our suppliers encounter financial difficulties, supply chain, technical or design problems when building or repairing a ship. These problems have impacted and may in the future impact the timely delivery or cost of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations. In addition, delays, mechanical faults and/or unforeseen incidents may result in cancellation of cruises or delays of new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks. Such events could result in lost revenue, increased operating expenses, or both, and thus adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nAn increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales and/or pricing. \n\nAlthough our ships can be redeployed, cruise sales and/or pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace, reductions in cruise capacity, overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors. As of December 31, 2022, a total of 63 new ships with approximately 143,000 berths were on order for delivery through 2028 in the cruise industry, including 10 ships currently scheduled to be delivered to our Global and Partner Brands. The further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders, without an increase in the cruise industry&#8217;s demand and/or share of the vacation market, could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement. \n\nIn addition, to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary/region and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand, it may negatively affect our pricing and profitability. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets. \n\nUnavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWe believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors, including industry demand and competition for key ports and destinations, existing capacity constraints, constraints related to the size of certain ships, security, financial limitations on port development, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, geopolitical developments, local governmental regulations, environmental regulations, and governmental response to disease outbreaks. Higher fuel costs also may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries as they become too costly to include. \n\nIn addition, certain ports and destinations have faced a surge of both cruise and non-cruise tourism which, in certain cases, has fueled anti-tourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations. In certain destinations, countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists have been contemplated and/or put into effect, including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers, which could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward. \n\nIncreased demand and competition for key ports of call or destinations, limitations on the availability or feasibility of use of specific ports of call and/or constraints on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports or destinations could adversely affect our operations and financial results. \n\nWe may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market. \n\nWe operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation. We, therefore, risk losing business not only to other cruise lines, but also to other vacation operators, which provide other leisure options, including hotels, resorts, internet-based alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours. \n\nWe face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing, travel advisor preference and also in terms of the nature of ships, services and destinations that we offer to guests. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but also on overall industry revenues. \n\nIn the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. \n\nIf we are unable to appropriately manage our cost and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations, it may adversely impact our business success. \n\nWe strive to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services. There can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies. Our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions across a broad scope of investment options with varying return profiles and time horizons for value realization. These include significant capital investment decisions such as ordering new ships, upgrading our existing fleet, enhancing our technology and/or data capabilities and expanding our portfolio of land-based assets, based on expected market preferences, competition and projected demand. There can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, our ownership and operation of older tonnage, in particular during the business disruption caused by COVID-19, has resulted in impaired asset values due to expected returns less than the carrying value of the assets. \n\nOur attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful. \n\nWe opportunistically seek to grow our business through, among other things, expansion into new destinations or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings. These attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business, require significant levels of investment and can strain our management, personnel, operations and systems. In addition, we may be unable to execute our attempts to expand our business. There can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRisks associated with our development and operation of key land-based destination projects may adversely impact our business or results of operations. \n\nWe have invested, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and partnerships, in a growing portfolio of key land-based projects including port and terminal facilities, private destinations and multi-brand destination projects. These investments can increase our exposure to certain key risks depending on the scope, location, and the ownership and management structure of these projects. These risks include susceptibility to weather events, exposure to local political/regulatory developments and policies, logistical challenges and human resource and labor risks and safety, environmental, and health risks, including challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects locally where we have these projects and relationships. \n\nOur reliance on travel advisors to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which could adversely impact our business. \n\nWe rely on travel advisors to generate bookings for our ships. Accordingly, we must maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures. If we fail to offer competitive compensation packages or fail to maintain our relationships, these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors, which could adversely impact our operating results. Our reliance on third-party sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets. In addition, the travel advisor community is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income of consumers. Significant disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel advisors available for us to market and sell our cruises, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the strength of our recovery from suspended operations could be delayed if we are not aligned and partnered with key travel advisors. \n\nBusiness activities that involve our co-investments with third parties may subject us to additional risks. \n\nPartnerships, joint ventures and other business structures involving our co-investments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. In addition to financial risks, our co-investment activities have also presented managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns. These or other issues related to our co-investments with third parties could adversely impact our operations or liquidity. Further, due to the arrangements we have in place with our partners in these ventures, we are limited in our ability to control the strategy of these ventures, or their use of capital and other key factors to their results of operation, which could adversely affect our investments and impact our results of operations. \n\nPast or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition. \n\nThe Company, from time to time, has engaged in acquisitions and may pursue acquisitions in the future, which are subject to, among other factors, the Company&#8217;s ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities. Accordingly, the Company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all, or that if completed, we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as, among others: (i) the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies; (ii) difficulty in aligning procedures, controls and/or policies; and (iii) future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition. In addition, acquisitions may adversely impact our liquidity and/or debt levels, and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively affected by unforeseen events and/or circumstances, which may result in an impairment charge. Any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe rely on supply chain vendors and third-party service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses. These vendors and service providers may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business. \n\nWe rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world. Any event impacting a vendor&#8217;s ability to deliver goods of the expected quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience. Events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including inclement weather, natural disasters, new laws and regulations, labor actions, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, cybersecurity events, and/or disruptions in third-party logistics or transportation systems, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such interruptions to our supply chain could increase our costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations. In addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding sourcing practices, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, could cause our operating costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation. \n\nIn order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses, such as our onboard concessionaires, certain of our call center operations, guest port services, logistics distribution and operation of a large part of our information technology systems. We are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. A failure to adequately monitor a third-party service provider&#8217;s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us. There is also a risk the confidentiality, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised. \n\nThe potential unavailability of insurance coverage, an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. \n\nWe seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. We normally obtain insurance based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value, and we also elect to self-insure, co-insure, or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or other business interruption. The limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage, evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage. We do not carry business interruption insurance and accordingly we have no insurance coverage for loss of revenues or earnings from our ships or other operations. Accordingly, we are not protected against all risks and cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident \n\nWe are members of four Protection and Indemnity (&#8220;P&#38;I&#8221;) clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 12 P&#38;I clubs, known as the International Group of P&#38;I Clubs (the &#8220;IG&#8221;). P&#38;I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis, and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 12 P&#38;I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers. \n\nWe cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or, if available, that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims. Additionally, if we or other insureds sustain significant losses, the result may be higher insurance premiums, cancellation of coverage, or the inability to obtain coverage. Such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. \n\nDisruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nOur principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in Florida, and we have shoreside offices throughout the world. Actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes/typhoons, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires or floods), \n\nmunicipal lockdowns, curfews, quarantines, or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity, reputation and results of operations. In addition, substantial or repeated information system failures, computer viruses or cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business. We do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems. As such, any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. \n\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and Liberian law could inhibit a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management. \n\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the Company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These include provisions in our Articles of Incorporation that prevent third parties, other than A. Wilhelmsen AS and Cruise Associates and their permitted transferees, from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors. \n\nWe may not be able to achieve our fiscal 2025 financial and climate-related performance goals. \n\nIn November 2022, we announced that we are targeting certain financial and climate-related performance goals for fiscal 2025. Our ability to achieve these goals is dependent on a number of factors, including the other risk factors described in this section. If we are not able to achieve these goals, the price of our common stock and reputation may be negatively affected. \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations. \n\nTo fund our capital expenditures (including new ship orders), operations and scheduled debt payments, we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, drawdowns under available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets. Any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending, such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affects our operating cash flows. As result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting suspension of our operations, we have experienced credit rating downgrades, which have reduced our ability to incur secured indebtedness by reducing the amount of indebtedness that we are permitted to secure, and may negatively impact our access to, and cost of, debt financing. Additionally, our ability to raise additional financing, whether or not secured, could be limited if our credit rating is further downgraded, and/or if we fail to comply with applicable covenants governing our outstanding indebtedness, and/or if overall financial market conditions worsen. \n\nOur ability to access additional funding as and when needed, our ability to timely refinance and/or replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including, but not limited to, the strength of the financial markets, global market conditions, including inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations, our recovery and financial performance, the recovery and performance of our industry in general and the size, scope and timing of our financial needs. In addition, even where financing commitments have been secured, significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us or could cause the conditions to the availability of such funding not to be satisfied. This could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our interest rate derivative instruments or other agreements. If any of the foregoing occurs for a prolonged period of time it will have a long-term negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to meet our financial obligations. \n\nOur substantial debt requires a significant amount of cash to service and could adversely affect our financial condition. \n\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had total debt of $23.4 billion. Our substantial debt has required us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate expenses. \n\nOur ability to make future scheduled payments on our debt service obligations or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate cash. This will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or sell assets. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt. \n\nOur substantial debt could also result in other negative consequences for us. For example, it could increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy or the industry in which we operate; limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future to satisfy our requirements relating to working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, strategic initiatives or other purposes; restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities; limit or restrict our ability to obtain and maintain performance bonds to cover our financial responsibility requirements in various jurisdictions for non-performance of guest travel, casualty and personal injury; make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; and increase our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are (and may in the future be) at a variable rate of interest. \n\nDespite our leverage, we may incur more debt, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Except for the restrictions under the indentures governing our Secured Notes, our Priority Guaranteed Notes, and certain of our other debt instruments, including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, we are not restricted under the terms of our debt instruments from incurring additional debt. Although the indentures governing the Secured Notes, the Priority Guaranteed Notes, and certain of our other debt instruments, including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. Additionally, there is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future or that such financing will be available with similar terms or terms that are commercially acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2022, we have commitments for approximately $7.1 billion of debt to finance the purchase of 7 ships on order by our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises brands, all of which are guaranteed by the export credit agencies in the countries in which the ships are being built. The ultimate size of each facility will depend on the final contract price (including change orders and owner&#8217;s supply) as well as fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding our \"Secured Notes\" and \"Priority Guaranteed Notes\". \n\nWe are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. In addition, if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on us. \n\nCertain of our debt instruments, including our indentures and our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, limit our flexibility in operating our business. For example, certain of our loan agreements and indentures restrict or limit our and our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase capital stock and make other restricted payments; make investments; consummate certain asset sales; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; grant or assume certain liens; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, both our export credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a minimum liquidity, a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and limit our net debt-to-capital ratio. In addition, our ECA facilities also require us to maintain a minimum stockholders' equity. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion on our covenants and existing waivers. \n\nAll of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. Despite these exceptions and qualifications, we cannot assure you that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our debt instruments will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. Any future indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms and we may be required to further encumber our assets. In addition, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under such indebtedness and certain of our other debt instruments, and the relevant debt holders or lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. If the debt under certain of our debt instruments that we enter into were to be accelerated, our liquid assets may be insufficient to repay in full such indebtedness. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding. \n\nIn addition, our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base. More specifically, we may be required to prepay our non-ECA and ECA facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period. Our debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade, which would require us to offer to repurchase our debt securities in the event of such change of control. \n\nIf we elect to settle conversions of our convertible notes in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, conversions of our convertible notes will result in dilution for our existing shareholders. Furthermore, new equity or convertible debt issuances will also result in dilution for our existing shareholders. \n\nWe have an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion in convertible notes outstanding. If note holders elect to convert, the notes will be converted into our shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our discretion. Prior to March 15, 2023, August 15, 2023, and May 15, 2025, our convertible notes issued in June 2020, October 2020, and August 2022, respectively, will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods only upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Beyond those dates, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date. Conversions of our convertible notes into shares of our common stock or a combination of common stock and cash, will result in dilution to our shareholders. Additionally, if we raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest, and these equity or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to that of holders of our common stock. \n\nWe did not declare quarterly dividends on our common stock in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. \n\nWe have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and recovery. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, in the event we thereafter declare a dividend, we will need to repay our amounts deferred under the export credit facilities. Payment of dividends would, in any case, depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. \n\nIncreased regulatory oversight, and the phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of a portion of our indebtedness. \n\nThe publication of certain LIBOR settings ceased after December 31, 2021, and uncertainty regarding alternative reference rates remains as many market participants await a wider adoption of replacement products prior to the cessation of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors (currently scheduled for June 30, 2023). When LIBOR ceases to exist, the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates might be affected if we, the agent, and/or the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments under such indebtedness fail to amend such indebtedness to implement a replacement rate. Regardless, such replacement rate will give due consideration to any evolving or then-existing conventions for similar credit facilities, which may result in different than expected interest payments. \n\nCompliance and Regulatory Risks \n\nChanges in U.S. or other countries&#8217; foreign travel policy have affected, and may continue to affect our results of operations. \n\nChanges in U.S. and other countries' foreign policy have in the past and could in the future result in the imposition of travel restrictions or travel bans on persons to certain countries or result in the imposition of travel advisories, warnings, rules, regulations or legislation exposing us to penalties or claims of monetary damages. In addition, some countries have adopted restrictions against U.S. travelers, and we currently cannot predict when those restrictions will be eased. The timing and scope of these changes and regulations can be unpredictable, and they could cause us to cancel scheduled sailings, possibly on short notice, or could result in litigation against us. This, in turn, could decrease our revenue, increase our operating costs and otherwise impair our profitability. \n\nFactors associated with climate change, including an increasing global regulatory focus, could adversely affect our business. \n\nThere is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change, greenhouse gas and other emissions. These regulatory efforts,both internationally and in the U.S., are still developing, including the international alignment of such efforts, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be on our business. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, pay for our emissions, modify our itineraries and may increase our exposure, if any, to climate change-related litigation. Such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs. For example, the European Union has proposed a series of significant carbon reforms under its Fit for 55 package designed to meet its 2030 emission goals, which would require us, among other things, to increase the use of low carbon fuel onboard our vessels as well as connectivity to shore power. The proposed legislation also includes updates to the European Union Emission Trading System which would impose requirements to purchase carbon emission allowances beginning in 2024. In addition, the U.S. and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted, or may enact, environmental regulations or policies, such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels (e.g., IMO Sulfur Limit) or the incoming carbon intensity indicator regulation, that have or could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets, increase our cost of fuel, limit the supply of compliant fuel, cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase and/or develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry. If enacted, these regulations may individually or collectively have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to increased costs associated with compliance and modified itineraries in the affected regions. \n\nThere has also been growing environmental scrutiny of the environmental impact of the cruise vacation industry, and some environmental groups are advocating for more stringent regulation of ship emissions at berth and at sea. This negative publicity of the cruise industry and any related measures may lead to changes in consumer preferences, such as methods or frequency of travel, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results and subject us to reputational impacts and costs. \n\nLabor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations and measures could affect operations and increase operating costs. \n\nWe are subject to various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties that govern, among other things, discharge from our ships, safety standards applicable to our ships, treatment of disabled persons, health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests, security standards on board our ships and at the ship/port interface areas, and financial responsibilities to our guests. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future and may increase our exposure, if any, to environmental-related litigation. \n\nA change in our tax status under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or other jurisdictions, may have adverse effects on our results of operations. \n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a U.S. trade or business and/or from sources within the U.S. In connection with the year end audit, each year, Faegre Drinker Biddle &#38; Reath LLP, our U.S. tax counsel, delivers to us an opinion, based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it, to the effect that this income, to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, is excluded from gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that most of our income (including that of our subsidiaries) is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships. \n\nOur ability to rely on Section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future. Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including Section 883, are subject to legislative change at any time. Moreover, changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity, residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders, trading volume or trading frequency of our shares, or relevant foreign tax laws of Liberia or the Bahamas, such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions, that could affect our eligibility for the Section 883 exemption. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from U.S. income tax on U.S. source shipping income in the future. If we were not entitled to the benefit of Section 883, we and our subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships, which would reduce our net income. \n\nAdditionally, portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime. Further, some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation. To the extent the United Kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked, we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions, adversely impacting our results of operations. \n\nNumerous countries are considering implementation of the OECD&#8217;s 15% global minimum tax, which may materially impact us. In addition, as budgetary constraints may adversely impact fiscal policy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be subject to changes in our existing tax treatment or other tax reform, as well as increased tax audits. \n\nWe are not a U.S. corporation and, as a result, our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests. \n\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and by the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. The provisions of the Business Corporation Act of Liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the U.S. However, there are very few judicial cases in Liberia interpreting the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. While the Business Corporation Act of Liberia provides that it is to be applied and construed to make the laws of Liberia, with respect of the subject matter of the Business Corporation Act of Liberia, uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions (and adopts their case law to the extent it is non-conflicting), there have been few Liberian court cases interpreting the Business Corporation Act of Liberia, and we cannot predict whether Liberian courts would reach the same conclusions as United States courts. We understand that legislation has been proposed but not yet adopted by the Liberian legislature which amends the provisions regarding the adoption of non-Liberian law to, among other things, provide for the adoption of the statutory and case law of Delaware and not also states with substantially similar legislative provisions, and potentially provide the courts of Liberia discretion in application of non-statutory corporation law of Delaware in cases when the laws of Liberia are silent. The right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in Liberian courts may be more limited than in U.S. jurisdictions. There may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in Liberia, and Liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments. Thus, our shareholders may have more difficulty challenging actions taken by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction. \n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\nConducting business globally results in increased costs and other risks. \n\nWe operate our business globally, which exposes us to a number of risks, including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions, volatile local political conditions, potential changes in duties and taxes, including changing and/or uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations, required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign-based companies, currency fluctuations, interest rate movements, difficulties in operating under local business environments, port quality and availability in certain regions, U.S. and global anti-bribery laws and regulations, imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings. \n\nOur future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of international markets. Factors that will be critical to our success in these markets include our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products and our ability to adapt our offerings to best suit rapidly evolving consumer demands. The execution of our planned growth strategies is dependent on meeting the governmental and regulatory measures and policies in each of these markets. Our ability to realize our future growth strategy is highly dependent on our ability to satisfy country-specific policies and requirements in order to return to service, as well as meet the needs of region-specific consumer preferences as services come back online. These factors may cause us to reevaluate some of our international business strategies. \n\nOperating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal, regulatory and tax requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We cannot guarantee consistent interpretation, application, and enforcement of newly issued rules and regulations, which could place limits on our operations or increase our costs, as well as negatively impact our future growth strategies in our key growth markets. We must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations. However, we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees, agents, representatives and other third parties with whom we associate properly adhere to applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we may be exposed to the risk of penalties and other liabilities if we fail to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Failure by us, our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs, which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows. \n\nAs a global operator, our business also may be impacted by changes in U.S. policy or priorities in areas such as trade, immigration and/or environmental or labor regulations, among others. Depending on the nature and scope of any such changes, they could impact our domestic and international business operations. Any such changes, and any international response to them, could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel and/or cross border transactions, impact our guest experience and/or increase our operating costs. \n\nIf we are unable to address these risks adequately, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected, including impairing the value of our ships and other assets. \n\nThe terms of our existing debt financing gives, and any future preferred equity or debt financing may give, holders of any preferred securities or debt securities rights that are senior to rights of our common shareholders. \n\nThe holders of our existing debt have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of liquidation. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock or convertible securities, the terms of the debt or the preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted. \n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results. \n\nWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates. Significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results, net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets. Our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted, often significantly, by changes in each of these factors \n\nA portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $6.0 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, which is net of our interest rate swap agreements. This amount represented approximately 25.0% of our total indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 1% increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our forecasted 2023 interest expense by approximately $34.8 million. Additionally, the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong U.S. dollar. \n\nAny further impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, equity investments and notes receivable could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. A challenging operating environment, conditions affecting consumer demand or spending, the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, expected ship deliveries, or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations. Reductions of cash flows used in the valuation analyses may result in the recording of impairments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nThe loss of key personnel, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel, or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nOur success depends, in large part, on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit, develop and retain high quality personnel as well as having adequate succession plans and back-up operating plans for when critical executives are unable to serve. As demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows, we must continue to effectively recruit, train, motivate and retain our employees, both shoreside and on our ships, in order to effectively compete in our industry, maintain our current business and support our projected global growth. \n\nWe have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel primarily due to competitive labor markets. A prolonged shortage of qualified personnel and/or increased turnover may inhibit our ability to operate our business in an optimal manner, and may result in increased costs if we need to hire temporary personnel, and/or increased wages and/or benefits in order to attract and retain employees, all of which may negatively impact our results of operations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 88% of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships. We may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, as could a loss of key employees, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel. \n\nIf we are unable to keep pace with developments, design, and implementation in technology , our operations or competitive position could become impaired. \n\nOur business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems. These technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven, refined, updated, upgraded and/or replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers&#8217; demands and expectations as well as to process our information effectively. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters, if there are any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in design or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, which could impair our operating results. \n\nWe may be unable to procure appropriate technology in a timely manner or at all or we may incur significant costs in doing so. A failure to adopt the appropriate technology, or a failure or obsolescence in the technology that we have adopted, could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWe are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches and the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining data integrity and security. \n\nWe are subject to cyber security attacks. These cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems, networks, and communications for economic gain or with the objective of disrupting, disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime and/or shoreside operations. The attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent, including phishing attacks, illegitimate requests for payment, theft of intellectual property, theft of confidential or non-public information, installation of malware, installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information. The frequency and sophistication of, and methods used to conduct, these attacks, have increased over time. \n\nA successful cyber security attack may target us directly, or it may be the result of a third party&#8217;s inadequate care, or resulting from vulnerabilities in licensed software. In either scenario, the Company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our brand reputation, and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation, fines, and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in technology, personnel, monitoring and other investments. \n\nWe are also subject to various risks associated with the collection, handling, storage, and transmission of sensitive information. In the regular course of business, we collect employee, customer, and other third-party data, including personally identifiable information and individual payment data, for various business purposes. Although we have policies and procedures in place to safeguard such sensitive information, this information has been and could be subject to cyber security attacks and the aforementioned risks. In addition, we are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual payment data. Those laws include, among others, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and regulations of the New York State Department of Financial Services and similar state agencies that impose additional cyber security requirements as a result of our provision of certain insurance products. Complying with these and other applicable laws has caused, and may cause, us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, and our failure to do so may expose us to substantial fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, or other expenses and adversely affect our business. Further, any changes to laws or regulations, including new restrictions or requirements applicable to our business, or an increase in enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose us to additional costs and liability and could limit our use and disclosure of such information. \n\nWhile we continue to evolve our cyber security practices in line with our business&#8217; reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape, and we invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications, our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or defending from all cyber security attacks impacting our operation. There can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results. \n\nAny breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, third-party or company data, could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers, and expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. Further, if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. \n\nLitigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our reputation. \n\nOur business is subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees, agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and/or our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot predict the quantum or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results, but any such impact may be material. While some of these claims are covered by insurance, we cannot be certain that all of them will be, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \n\n"

Legal Proceedings \n\nAs previously reported, two lawsuits were filed against us in August 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the \"Court\") under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint filed by Havana Docks Corporation (\"Havana Docks Action\") alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal, and the complaint filed by Javier Garcia-Bengochea (the \"Port of Santiago Action\") alleges that he holds an interest in the Port of Santiago, Cuba, both of which were expropriated by the Cuban government. The complaints further allege that we trafficked in those properties by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities. The plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. \n\nThe Court dismissed the Port of Santiago Action with prejudice on the basis that the plaintiff acquired his interest in the Port of Santiago after the enactment of the Helms-Burton Act. In November 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed the Court's dismissal of the lawsuit. \n\nIn the Havana Docks Action, the Court entered final judgment in December 2022 in favor of the plaintiff and awarded damages and attorneys' fees to the plaintiff in the aggregate amount of approximately $112 million. We have appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and the plaintiff has cross-appealed with regards to the interest calculation used for purposes of determining damages. We believe we have meritorious grounds for and intend to vigorously pursue our appeal. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a charge of approximately $130.0 million to Other (expense) income within in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss related to the Havana Docks Action, including post-judgment interest and related legal defense costs and bonding fees. \n\nIn addition, we are routinely involved in claims typical within the cruise vacation industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. We believe the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. \n\n"

In the event we declare a dividend, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities as part of the principal amortization deferrals agreed with them during 2020 and 2021. Accordingly, we have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020. Refer to Note 10 . Shareholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 , filed with the SEC on March 1, 2022 and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). (Refer to Note 1 . General and Note 2 . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). Certain of our accounting policies are deemed \"critical,\" as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: \n\nManagement's Plan and Liquidity \n\nIn the face of the global pandemic impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in March 2020 and began resuming guest cruise operations in 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. \n\nAs part of our liquidity management, we rely on estimates of our future liquidity which include numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The principal assumptions used to estimate our future liquidity consist of: \n\n&#8226; Expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings; \n\n&#8226; Expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day; \n\n&#8226; Expected increase in occupancy levels, reaching historical levels in the spring of 2023; and \n\n&#8226; Inflationary increases to our operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food as compared to 2019. \n\nWe will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. Actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities. \n\nShip Accounting \n\nShips represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10%-15% projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. The 30-35 year useful life and 10%-15% residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. However, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within Cruise operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. \n\nWe periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. \n\nWe use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The \n\nsignificant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. \n\nWe use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. We also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred. \n\nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2022 would have increased by approximately $85.0 million. If our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2022 would have increased by approximately $307.6 million. We have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates. \n\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets \n\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, and if necessary, a goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. \n\nThe goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, which may also include a combination of a market-based valuation approach. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2022 impairment assessment consisted of: \n\n&#8226; Forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day; \n\n&#8226; Occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries; \n\n&#8226; Vessel operating expenses; \n\n&#8226; Terminal growth rate; and \n\n&#8226; Weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate). \n\nThe discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. We discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital. \n\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. As amended by ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) &#8211; Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. Refer to Note 4 . Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on goodwill. \n\nThe impairment review for indefinite-life intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, for trademarks and trade names. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2022 impairment assessment consisted of: \n\n&#8226; Forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day; \n\n&#8226; Occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries; \n\n&#8226; Terminal growth rate; \n\n&#8226; Royalty rate; and \n\n&#8226; Weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate). \n\nIf the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 5. Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on indefinite-life intangible assets. \n\nWe review our ships and other long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 6 . Property and Equipment to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets. \n\nWe estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. Quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. Accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique. \n\nRoyal Caribbean International Reporting Unit \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit's fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean reporting unit was $296.4 million. \n\nWe did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Royal Caribbean International's goodwill during 2022 as no triggering events were identified. \n\nSilversea Cruises Reporting Unit \n\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed our annual impairment review of Silversea Cruises goodwill. We did not perform qualitative assessments but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment tests. As of November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 26% and 35% as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Silversea Cruises reporting unit was $508.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed our annual impairment reviews of the Silversea Cruises trade name. As a result of the quantitative tests, we determined that the fair value of the Silversea Cruises' trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25% and 19%, as of November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' tr ade name. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of indefinite-life intangible assets was $321.5 million, which primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name. \n\nWe did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Silversea Cruises's goodwill or trade names during 2022 and 2021, as no triggering events were identified. \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nWe enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although some of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance. Refer to Note 2 . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on related authoritative guidance, the Company's hedging programs and derivative financial instruments. \n\nOn a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options with third-party institutions in over-the-counter markets. We estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments' contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options&#8217; contract terms, such as exercise price and maturity, and readily available market data, such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. \n\nWe estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps' contract terms and forward prices. We derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. We also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties. \n\nWe adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk. \n\nWe believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions, inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience. \n\nContingencies&#8212;Litigation \n\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made. \n\nSeasonality \n\nOur revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. Demand has historically been strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere's summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have historically focused on deployment to the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period. This seasonal trend was disrupted with the voluntary suspension of our global cruise operations effective March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We resumed our global cruise operations commencing in the second half of 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. Since our full fleet is in service, we expect to return to seasonal trends \n\nFinancial Presentation \n\nDescription of Certain Line Items \n\nRevenues \n\nOur revenues are comprised of the following: \n\n&#8226; Passenger ticket revenues , which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships; and \n\n&#8226; Onboard and other revenues , which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices, cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. Onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or services onboard our ships, as well as revenues received for procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates. \n\nCruise Operating Expenses \n\nOur cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following: \n\n&#8226; Commissions, transportation and other expenses , which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel advisor commissions, air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees; \n\n&#8226; Onboard and other expenses , which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues, including the costs of products sold onboard our ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and post-cruise tours and related credit card fees, as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third-party concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates; \n\n&#8226; Payroll and related expenses , which consist of costs for shipboard personnel (costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in Marketing, selling and administrative expenses ); \n\n&#8226; Food expenses , which include food costs for both guests and crew; \n\n&#8226; Fuel expenses , which include fuel and related delivery, storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements; and \n\n&#8226; Other operating expenses , which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel related insurance, entertainment and gains and/or losses related to the sale of our ships, if any. \n\nWe do not allocate payroll and related expenses, food expenses, fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience. \n\nSelected Operational and Financial Metrics \n\nWe utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition. As discussed in more detail herein, certain of these metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with the related GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in \n\naccordance with GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful whe n assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. For the p eriods presented, these items included (i) other expenses, which includes our loss contingency in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation recorded in 2022; (ii) impa irment and credit losses; (iii) restru cturing charges and other initiative expenses; (iv) equity investment asset impairments; (v) net insurance recoveries or costs related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas ; (vi) Pullmantur reorganization settlement; (vii) the net gain recognized in 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand; (viii) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. and (ix) transaction costs related to the 2018 Silversea Cruises acquisition. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations. \n\nAdjusted Loss per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\") is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Loss per Share to Adjusted Loss per share is provided below under Results of Operations. \n\nAdjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is a non-GAAP measure that represents net loss less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) loss on the extinguishment of debt&#894; (ii) the amortization of non-cash debt discount on our convertible notes&#894; (iii) the estimated cash refund expected to be paid to Pullmantur guests and other expenses incurred as part of the Pullmantur S.A. reorganization&#894; (iv) impairment and credit losses&#894; (v) equity investment asset impairments&#894; (vi) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas&#894; (vii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses &#894; (viii) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; for 2020, the change in the fair value in the Silversea Cruises contingent consideration;(ix) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. (previously known as Silversea Cruises Group Ltd.) noncontrolling interest in Silversea Cruises, which noncontrolling interest we acquired on July 9, 2020&#894; (x) the net gain recognized in the first quarter of 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand&#894; (xi) currency translation losses recognized during the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the ships classified as assets held-for-sale that were previously chartered to Pullmantur&#894; (xii) the net loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the elimination of the three-month reporting lag for Silversea Cruises; and (xiii) loss contingency recorded in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation inclusive of related legal fees and costs . A reconciliation of Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is provided below under Results of Operations. \n\nAvailable Passenger Cruise Days (\" APCD \") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary. \n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations. \n\nGross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses. \n\nCarbon Intensity is our measurement of carbon dioxide emissions per gross tonne nautical mile (well-to-wake). \n\nNet Cruise Costs and Net C ruise Costs Excluding Fuel are non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, fuel expenses (each of which is described above under the Description of Certain Line Items heading). In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. A reconciliation of Gross Cruise \n\nCosts to Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel is provided below under Results of Operations. For the 2022 period presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel excludes restructuring and other initiative expenses. \n\nOccupancy (\"Load factor\") , in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins. \n\nPassenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises. \n\nAlthough discussed in prior periods, we did not disclose or reconcile in this report our Gross Yields and Net Yields, as defined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Historically, we have utilized these financial metrics to measure relevant rate comparisons to other periods. However, our 2022 and 2021 reduction in capacity and revenues, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, do not allow for a meaningful analysis and comparison of these metrics and as such these metrics have been excluded from this report. For Gross Cruise Costs, Net Cruise Costs, and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel we present amounts in constant currency compared to 2019, which is the last year of normalized operations. \n\nExecutive Overview \n\n2022 was a transitional year filled with numerous accomplishments. We returned our entire fleet into operations, took delivery of Celebrity Beyond and Wonder of the Seas , and acquired Silver Endeavour . Additionally, we achieved positive EBITDA and operating cash flow for the year, controlled costs to minimize the impacts of inflation, and saw record shipboard revenues for the year. \n\nOur 2022 Net Loss was $(2.2) billion, or $(8.45) per diluted share, compared to Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $1.9 billion, or $8.95 per diluted share in 2019, the most recent year of normalized operations. Adjusted Net Loss for 2022 was $(1.9) billion, or $(7.50) per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $2.0 billion, or $9.54 per diluted share in 2019. 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $711.6 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 billion in 2019. We started 2022 by operating 51 ships and sailing at 57% load factor in the first quarter of 2022. We successfully completed the return of our entire fleet into operations during the second quarter and achieved 96% load factors in the third quarter with the Caribbean eclipsing triple digits at close to 105% during the third quarter. We finished the year sailing at almost 100% load factor in December 2022, with holiday sailings close to 110% during the fourth quarter. \n\nDespite only partially operating for the first half of the year, total revenues were $8.8 billion in 2022, compared to $11.0 billion in 2019. Load factors for 2022 were 85%, and 96% for the second half of the year. Additionally, total revenue per passenger cruise day in 2022 was higher than record 2019 levels, driven by strong onboard revenue performance. \n\nCruise operating expenses increased from $6.1 billion in 2019 to $6.6 billion in 2022. Gross Cruise Costs per APCD increased 8.2% as-reported and 8.8% in Constant Currency, compared to 2019. Net Cruise Costs, excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 12.9% as-reported and 13.5% in Constant Currency, compared to 2019. Our cost-conscious mindset has helped to mitigate the effects of inflation, and we benefited from reduced costs related to health protocols as the year went on. For the year Net Cruise Costs included $5.97 per APCD of transitory costs related to health protocols, and one-time lagging costs related to fleet ramp up. 2022 also included Galveston terminal construction costs and increased costs associated with CocoCay, which were not present in 2019. \n\nIn 2023, we expect our capacity to increase by 14% compared to 2019, despite the reduction in capacity resulting from the divestiture of Azamara and the sale of older ships. Since 2019 we have welcomed 9 new ships across our five brands, and with the addition of Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova in 2023 we expect a total of 11 new vessels operating by year end. These new ships, along with enhanced onboard offerings and continued investment in destinations, are expected to help drive increases in both Net Yields and Total revenues as our capacity expands. We also plan to continue investing in both more efficient newbuilds and retrofitting our existing fleet with technology to help reach our long-term goals to reduce carbon intensity. Lastly, we anticipate taking delivery of Icon of the Seas by the end of the year, to begin operating revenue sailings in 2024. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nIn addition to the items discussed above under \"Executive Overview,\" significant items for 2022 include: \n\n&#8226; Our Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $(2.2) billion and $(1.9) billion, or $(8.45) and $(7.50) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, reflecting our return to full operations, compared to Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $(5.3) billion and $(4.8) billion, or $(20.89) and $(19.19) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\n&#8226; Total revenues, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rates, increased by $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The increase reflects our full return to operations by June 2022 compared to 2021 when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect for a substantial portion of our fleet. APCDs for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 41,197,650 compared to 11,767,441, in the same period in 2021. \n\n&#8226; The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our passenger ticket and onboard and other revenue transactions, denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, resulted in a decrease in total revenues of $149.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. \n\n&#8226; Total cruise operating expenses, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rate, increased by $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, which reflects our return to operations in 2022 compared to 2021 when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect for the substantial portion of our fleet. \n\n&#8226; The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses, denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, resulted in a decrease in total operating expenses of $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. \n\n&#8226; In January 2022 and April 2022, we took delivery of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond , respectively. To finance the purchases, we borrowed $1.3 billion and &#8364;0.7 billion, or approximately $0.7 billion based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2022, respectively, under previously committed unsecured term loans. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond entered service in the first and second quarters of 2022, respectively. \n\n&#8226; In July 2022, we purchased the Silver Endeavour for our Silversea Cruises brand. To finance the purchase, we assumed $277 million of debt. Silver Endeavour entered service in the fourth quarter of 2022. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. \n\n&#8226; During the year ended December 31, 2022, we executed and amended various financing arrangements, we refinanced $6.9 billion of 2022 and 2023 maturities, which resulted in a total loss on extinguishment of debt of $93.8 million. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on our 2022 financing activity. \n\n&#8226; During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a loss contingency of $130.0 million inclusive of related legal fees and costs in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation. Refer to Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8.

Passenger ticket revenues increased by $4.9 billion, or 515.6% to $5.8 billion in 2022 from $0.9 billion in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $129.8 million. \n\nThe remaining 34.5% of total revenues was comprised of Onboard and other revenues , which increased $2.5 billion, or 415.6% to $3.0 billion in 2022 from $591.0 million in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $19.2 million . \n\nThe increase in total revenues was due to our return of operations, with our full fleet in service by June 2022, compared to 2021 when we began resuming guest cruise operations. Occupancy in 2022 was 85.1% compared to 49.3% in 2021. \n\nOnboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $331.9 million in 2022 and $72.0 million in 2021. \n\nCruise Operating Expenses \n\nTotal C r uise operating expenses increased by $4.0 billion, or 148.9%, to $6.6 billion in 2022 from $2.7 billion in 2021. \n\nThe increase in Cruise operating expenses was driven by the return to operations in 2022, with the majority of our fleet in service compared to 2021, when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect. The 2022 operating expenses include the overhead costs associated with bringing our ships back to service and our crew back on board our ships. Additionally, inflationary pressures have impacted our operating costs, especially in fuel and food expense. Our cost of fuel (net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements) for 2 022 increased 43% per metric ton compared to 2021 mainly due to the increase in fuel price. \n\nMarketing, Selling and Administrative Expenses \n\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses increased $0.2 billion, or 15.5% to $1.6 billion in 2022 from $1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was due to the ramp up of our global sales and marketing efforts starting in the second half of 2021 as we commenced our resumption of operations. Additionally, having our full fleet in service as of June 30, 2022 increased overall expenses compared to 2021. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $0.1 billion, or 8.8%, to $1.4 billion in 2022 compared to $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to the addition of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond to our fleet in January 2022 and April 2022, respectively, and depreciation for Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn, which were delivered in March 2021 and November 2021, respectively. \n\n. Impairment and Credit Losses \n\nImpairment and c redit losses for 2022 was $0.6 million compared to $82.0 million in 2021. The decrease in impairment loss was primarily due to 2021 impairment charges of ce rtain construction in progress projects that were reduced in scope or terminated as a result of COVID-19, which did not recur in 2022. \n\nOther Income (Expense) \n\nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized , increased $72.4 million, or 5.6%, to $1.4 billion in 2022 from $1.3 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to additional indebtedness associated with new ship deliveries. \n\nEquity investment income for 2022 was $56.7 million compared to Equity investment Loss of $135.5 million in 2021. The increase in income was primarily due to income from TUI Cruises, one of our equity investments, in 2022 compared to losses in 2021. \n\nOther (expense) income decreased $140.7 million, or 693.5%, to other expense of $120.4 million in 2022 from other income of $20.3 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a loss contingency of $130.0 million recorded in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation. \n\nOther Comprehensive Income \n\nOther comprehensive income in 2022 was $67.7 million compared to $28.5 million in 2021. The change was primarily due to Changes in defined benefits plan in 2022 of $48.9 million compared to $8.7 million in 2021. \n\nFuture Application of Accounting Standards \n\nRefer to Note. 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on Recent Accounting Pronouncements . \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nSources and Uses of Cash \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities increased by $2.4 billion to cash provided of $0.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $1.9 billion for the same period in 2021. Our full resumption of operations in 2022 generated an increase in guest ticket and onboard collections for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a partial resumption of operations in 2021. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $843.0 million to cash used of $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $2.1 billion for the same period in 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of $480.4 million due to the increased cost associated with taking delivery of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond in 2022 compared to taking delivery of Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn in 2021, and an increase in cash paid on settlement of derivative financial instruments of $281.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021. \n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to cash provided of $3.0 billion in 2021. The decrease of $1.3 billion was primarily attributable to proceeds from common stock issuances of $1.6 billion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022, and offset by repayments of commercial paper notes of $414.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022. \n\nFuture Capital Commitments \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nOur future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December 31, 2022, we have one Oasis-class ship, and three ships of a new generation, known as our Icon-class, on order for our Royal Caribbean International brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22,500 berths. As of December 31, 2022, we have one Edge-class ship on order for our Celebrity Cruises brand, with a capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we have two ships on order for our Silversea Cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths. Refer to Item 1. Business-Operations for further information on our ships on order. We have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80% of the cost of the ship for the seven ships on order for our Global Brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Additionally, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l&#8217;Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, excluding any ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $9.8 billion, of which we had deposited $832 million. Approximately 52.3% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments and Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . \n\nWe have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted on our cash flows, liquidity and financial position by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to preserve liquidity, we deferred a significant portion of our planned 2020, 2021 and 2022 capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2022, we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, will be approximately $4.1 billion for 2023. This amount does not include any ships on order by our Partner Brands. \n\nMaterial Cash Requirements \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our material cash requirements were as follows (in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Payments due by period &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Operating Activities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest on debt (1) \n\n$ 1,345,729 $ 1,187,749 $ 1,036,011 $ 780,404 $ 648,639 $ 1,106,447 $ 6,104,979 Investing Activities: Ship purchase obligations (2) \n\n2,705,127 1,846,333 1,287,368 1,218,073 &#8212; &#8212; 7,056,901 Total $ 4,050,856 $ 3,034,082 $ 2,323,379 $ 1,998,477 $ 648,639 $ 1,106,447 $ 13,161,880 ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________________________________ \n\n. \n\n(1) Long-term debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2037 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates. Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, using the applicable rate at December 31, 2022. Debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2022. \n\n(2) Amounts are based on contractual installment and delivery dates for our ships on order. Included in these figures are $5.7 billion in final contractual installments, which have committed financing covering 80% of the cost of the ships on order for our Global Brands, almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion or any agreements entered for ships on order that remain contingent upon completion of conditions precedent. \n\nRefer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for maturities related to debt. \n\nRefer to Note 9 . Leases to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for maturities related to lease liabilities. \n\nRefer to Funding Needs and Sources below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations. \n\nAs a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements . \n\nRefer to Note 7 . Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for ownership restrictions related to TUI Cruises. \n\nRefer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for export credit agency guarantees. \n\nRefer to Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for other agreements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position. \n\nFunding Needs and Sources \n\nHistorically, we relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, draw-downs under our available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations. COVID-19 resulted in our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations from March 2020 up to our full fleet returning to service during the second quarter of 2022. The suspension of operations strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity, causing us to take actions resulting in reductions in our operating expenses, reductions in our capital expenses and new financings and other liquidity actions. \n\nThe Company continually identifies and evaluates actions to maintain adequate liquidity. These include, and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings. Additionally, we will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. Actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities. \n\nWe have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $7.6 billion of committed financing for our ships on order. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our obligations due through December 31, 2023 primarily consisted of $2.1 billion related to debt maturities, $1.3 billion related to interest on debt and $2.7 billion related to progress payments on our ship orders and, based on expected delivery date, the final installments payable due upon the delivery of Silver Nova, Icon of the Seas, and Celebrity Ascent . \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had liquidity of $2.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion, $0.3 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, and a $0.7 billion commitment for a 364-day term loan facility which was terminated in February 2023 in connection with our completion of the $700 million 7.25% Priority Guaranteed Notes offering. Our revolving credit facilities were partially utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities as of December 31, 2022, which were subsequently amended in January 2023, as described in Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements. We have agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases unless we repay the remaining principal payments that were deferred under our export credit facilities in 2020 and 2021. Refer to Note 10 . Shareholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. \n\nIf any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations. \n\nBased on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. However, there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate as there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements. Refer to Note 1 . General, Management&#8217;s Plan and Liquidity, to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. \n\nDebt Covenants \n\nOur export credit facilities, our non-export credit facilities, and certain of our credit card processing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, and maintain minimum liquidity, and under certain facilities, to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity. The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters. Our minimum stockholders' equity and maximum net debt-to-capital calculations exclude the impact of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on Total stockholders' equity . In 2021 and 2022, the financial covenant levels were modified for 2023 and 2024. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months. \n\nAny further covenant waivers may lead to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections as may be agreed with our lenders. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms. If we require additional waivers and are not able to obtain them or repay the debt facilities, this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contracts. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding debt covenants. \n\nDividends \n\nThe declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our board of directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business. In the event we declare a dividend or engage in share repurchases, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities. Accordingly, we have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nFinancial Instruments and Other \n\nGeneral \n\nWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Refer to Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our long-term debt obligations including future interest payments. At December 31, 2022, approximately 75.0% of our long-term debt was effectively fixed as compared to 65.7% as of December 31, 2021. We use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense. \n\nMarket risk associated with our fixed-rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate basis to manage this risk. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we redeemed our 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2022 in full and terminated the related interest rate swap agreements, which resulted in the dedesignation of the fair value hedges and recognition of an immaterial loss representing the fair value hedge carrying amount adjustment on these notes. At December 31, 2022, there were no interest rate swap agreements for fixed-rate debt instruments. \n\nThe estimated fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2022 was $14.8 billion, using quoted market prices, where available, or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile. The fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of $7.7 million as of December 31, 2021, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2022 would decrease the fair value of our hedged and unhedged long-term fixed-rate debt by approximately $369.4 million. \n\nMarket risk associated with our long-term floating-rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis to manage this risk. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2023 interest expense by approximately $34.8 million, assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floating-rate debt instruments: \n\n##TABLE_START Debt Instrument Swap Notional as of December 31, 2022 (In thousands) Maturity Debt Floating Rate All-in Swap Fixed Rate \n\nCelebrity Reflection term loan \n\n$ 109,083 October 2024 LIBOR plus 0.40% 2.85% \n\nQuantum of the Seas term loan \n\n245,000 October 2026 LIBOR plus 1.30% 3.74% \n\nAnthem of the Seas term loan \n\n271,875 April 2027 LIBOR plus 1.30% 3.86% \n\nOvation of the Seas term loan \n\n380,417 April 2028 LIBOR plus 1.00% 3.16% \n\nHarmony of the Seas term loan (1) \n\n338,990 May 2028 EURIBOR plus 1.15% 2.26% \n\nOdyssey of the Seas term loan (2) \n\n383,333 October 2032 LIBOR plus 0.96% 3.21% \n\nOdyssey of the Seas term loan (2) \n\n191,667 October 2032 LIBOR plus 0.96% 2.84% $ 1,920,365 ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1) Interest rate swap agreements hedging the Euro-denominated term loan for Harmony of the Seas include EURIBOR zero-floors matching the hedged debt EURIBOR zero-floor. Amount presented is based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. \n\n(2) Interest rate swap agreements hedging the term loan of Odyssey of the Seas include LIBOR zero-floors matching the debt LIBOR zero-floor. The effective dates of the $383.3 million and $191.7 million interest rate swap agreements are October 2020 and October 2022, respectively. The unsecured term loan for the financing of Odyssey of the Seas was drawn on March 2021. \n\nThese interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \n\nThe fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of $123.3 million as of December 31, 2022 based on the present value of expected future cash flows. These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \n\nOur primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in Euros, our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations. On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nThe estimated fair value, as of December 31, 2022, of our Euro-denominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of $40.7 million, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, not including ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $9.8 billion, of which we had deposited $0.8 billion as of such date. Approximately 52.3% of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the Euro as of December 31, 2022, assuming no changes in comparative interest rates, would result in a $511.7 million increase in the United States dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate. Our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge. \n\nOur international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows. We manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis, which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets. Therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time. The extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time. In addition, some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available. \n\nWe consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a long-term nature. We address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries' and investments' functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments. We had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately &#8364;433.0 million, or approximately $461.9 million, through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately &#8364;97.0 million, or approximately $110.3 million. \n\nWe have included net gains of approximately $63.5 million and $47.7 million of foreign-currency transaction remeasurement and changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nOn a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. During 2022, we maintained an average of approximately $1.1 billion of these foreign currency forward contracts. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in losses of approximately $(101.8) million, $(30.9) million and $(19.0) million, respectively, which offset gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of $93.0 million, $24.3 million and $(1.5) million, respectively. These changes were recognized in earnings within Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). \n\nFuel Price Risk \n\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships. Fuel cost, net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements, as a percentage of our total revenues, was approximately 12.1% in 2022, 25.1% in 2021 and 16.8% in 2020. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $498.1 million, maturing through 2023. These fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fuel swap agreements designated as hedges of projected fuel purchases represented 50% of our projected 2023 fuel requirements. The estimated fair value of our fuel swap agreements at December 31, 2022 was estimated to be a liability of $6.1 million. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% increase in our weighted-average fuel price from that experienced during the year ended December 31, 2022 would increase our forecasted 2023 fuel cost by approximately $61.0 million, net of the impact of fuel swap agreements. \n\n"

Controls and Procedures \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (the \"SEC\"). \n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in its report, which is included herein on page F-2. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls \n\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions. \n\n"
