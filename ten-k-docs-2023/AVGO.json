To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets. \n\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had 17,035 U.S. and other patents and 618 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. \n\nWe focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims. \n\nWe and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms. \n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop non-infringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights. \n\nWith respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow \n\narrangement that would enables them to obtain a limited right to access and use our source code if specific conditions are met. \n\nEmployees \n\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain our workforce. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset. Competition for these and other talented employees is significant in many locations where we operate, such as Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia. \n\nWe measure our employees&#8217; engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and employee feedback. Our global voluntary attrition rate in fiscal year 2022 was approximately 6.5%, below the technology industry benchmark (AON, 2022 Salary Increase and Turnover Study &#8212; Second Edition, September 2022). \n\nWe also track the portion of our workforce in research and development roles. As of October 30, 2022, we had approximately 20,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 63% in research and development roles. By geography, approximately 54% of our employees are located in North America, 35% in Asia, and 11% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \n\nGovernmental Regulation \n\nOur semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health, safety and the environment. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. \n\nWe believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental, health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures. \n\nWe are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements, including legislation enacted in the U.S., European Union and China, among a growing number of jurisdictions, which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead, among other restricted substances, in electronic products, which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging. In addition, our business is subject to various import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive orders, and rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Organization for Standardization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;). These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time. We may incur significant expenditures in future periods as a result. \n\nSeasonality \n\nHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half, primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications products. These products have historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile devices manufactured by our OEM customers. However, from time to time, typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large OEMs, particularly with our wireless communications products. We have a diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of this diversification. \n\nOther Information \n\nOur website is www.broadcom.com.

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nOur business, operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Many of the following risks and uncertainties are, and may continue to be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. \n\nRisk Factors Summary \n\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business \n\n&#8226; Adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on us. \n\n&#8226; We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry. \n\n&#8226; The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business. \n\n&#8226; Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market. \n\n&#8226; We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers. \n\n&#8226; Our business is subject to various governmental regulations and trade restrictions. Compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense and, if we fail to maintain compliance, we may be forced to cease manufacture and distribution of certain products or subjected to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties. \n\n&#8226; Global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect us. \n\n&#8226; The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted normal business activity. \n\n&#8226; We are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners, including product inventory levels and product sell-through. \n\n&#8226; Our dependence on senior management and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. \n\n&#8226; The failure to complete or realize the expected benefits of our acquisition of VMware, Inc. (&#8220;VMware Merger&#8221;) may adversely affect our business and our stock price. \n\n&#8226; We may pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\n&#8226; We may be involved in legal proceedings, including IP, securities litigation, and employee-related claims. \n\n&#8226; Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations. \n\n&#8226; Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue. \n\n&#8226; Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue. \n\n&#8226; A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations, or those of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on us. \n\n&#8226; We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities. \n\n&#8226; An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\n&#8226; Our ability to maintain or improve gross margin. \n\n&#8226; Our ability to protect the significant amount of IP in our business. \n\n&#8226; Incompatibility of our software products with operating environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and services could decrease. \n\n&#8226; Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could adversely affect us. \n\n&#8226; Licensed third party software used in our products may not be available to us in the future, which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense. \n\n&#8226; Use of open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect us. \n\n&#8226; Failure of our software products to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\n&#8226; We are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability. \n\n&#8226; The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs. \n\n&#8226; We make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business. \n\n&#8226; We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase our costs, restrict our operations and require expenditures. \n\n&#8226; Social and environmental regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors. \n\n&#8226; The average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future. \n\n&#8226; Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses. \n\nRisks Relating to Taxes \n\n&#8226; Changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Our corporate income taxes could significantly increase if we are unable to maintain our tax concessions or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and concessions prove to be incorrect. \n\n&#8226; Our income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could materially, adversely affect financial results. \n\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness \n\n&#8226; Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy. \n\n&#8226; The instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business. \n\n&#8226; Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flows from our business to pay our substantial debt. \n\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock \n\n&#8226; Volatility of our stock price could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management. \n\n&#8226; The amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate. \n\n&#8226; A substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors. \n\n&#8226; There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends. \n\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business \n\nAdverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity. \n\nA general slowdown in the global economy, including a recession, or in a particular region or industry, an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners, inflation or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity. Adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected our business and results of operations. Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt. An escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets or compete effectively with Chinese companies. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, especially China, and possible \n\ndecoupling of the U.S. and China economies, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. Such events may also (i) cause our customers and consumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology spending, (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers, and (iv) intensify pricing pressures. Any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry. \n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used). From time to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general, and in our business in particular. The industry recently experienced a significant upturn due to the supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices. It is possible that this recent industry up-cycle will be followed by a downturn, and historically, such down-cycles have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix, accelerated erosion of average selling prices and elimination of expedite fees leading to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer. \n\nThe majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business. \n\nWe are dependent on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective contract manufacturers (&#8220;CMs&#8221;), and certain distributors for a majority of our business and revenue. For fiscal year 2022, sales to distributors accounted for 56% of our net revenue. We believe aggregate sales, through all channels, to Apple and our top five end customers, accounted for approximately 20% and 35% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2022, respectively. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by our significant customers. \n\nOur semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers&#8217; purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. We expect this trend to continue, which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and, should we fail to perform under these arrangements, we could also be liable for significant monetary damages. \n\nThe loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nDependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWe operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes CMs, such as third-party wafer foundries and module assembly and test capabilities. Our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques, and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our own or with a particular CM. \n\nWe depend on our CMs to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. We do not generally have long-term capacity commitments with our CMs and substantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum quantities. Further, our CMs may fail to timely develop new, advanced manufacturing processes, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies or, from time to time, will cease to, or will become unable to, manufacture a component for us. As lead times to identify, qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new CM is typically lengthy, there is often no readily available alternative source and there may be other constraints on our ability to change CMs. In addition, qualifying new CMs is often expensive, and they may not produce products as cost-effectively as our current suppliers. \n\nTSMC, one of our CMs, manufactured approximately 90% of the wafers manufactured by our CMs during fiscal year 2022. We believe our wafer requirements represent a meaningful portion of TSMC&#8217;s total production capacity. However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including some of our competitors, and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. In addition, TSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to us. \n\nIf any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our customer demand, or to the same extent as our competitors, fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities. This has in the past damaged, and may in the future damage our relationships with our customers. This could also result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations, payment of significant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and gross margin. \n\nFurther, any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services that we utilize, including TSMC&#8217;s supply of wafers to us, as a result of a natural disaster, climate change, water shortages, political unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, medical epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations. \n\nWe purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers. \n\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. During fiscal year 2022, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials providers, some of which are single source suppliers. As certain materials are highly specialized, the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices due to commodity price increases, capacity constraints, inflation, or other factors, any of which could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced some supply constraints and increases in prices, including with respect to wafers and substrates. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China. The supply constraints have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our customer relationships. Further, continued supply constraints for these or any other reasons could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties. \n\nOur business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements, including anti-competition and import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive orders. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, and have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. The U.S. government may also add companies to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited exports to specific countries, which have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and our revenue. For example, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., one of our customers, is subject to certain U.S. export restrictions, which has required us to suspend sales to Huawei until we obtain licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. We may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses to allow us to export products to them. These restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by other governments, especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nOur products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the FTC. From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel. \n\nIf any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology, pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory investigations. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of government, law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties. \n\nIn addition, the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur. For example, if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared, it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards, lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution. \n\nGlobal political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nA majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue. In addition, as of October 30, 2022, nearly 49% of our employees were located outside the U.S. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include: \n\n&#8226; changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions or geopolitical turmoil (including China-Taiwan relations), including terrorism, war or political or military coups, state-sponsored or politically motivated cyber-attacks, or civil disturbances or political instability foreign and domestic; \n\n&#8226; restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments, data privacy regulations, imposition of climate change regulations, and trade protection measures, including increasing protectionism, import/export restrictions (including with regards to advanced technologies), import/export duties and quotas, trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, all of which have increased in recent years; \n\n&#8226; difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support, and transportation delays; \n\n&#8226; potential inability to localize software products; \n\n&#8226; difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners; \n\n&#8226; public health or safety concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and other natural- or man-made disasters; \n\n&#8226; nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets; and \n\n&#8226; changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws. \n\nA significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations of the many countries in which we do business. In addition, the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may, in some cases, conflict with each other. Although our policies prohibit us, our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti-corruption or other policies and procedures. Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted normal business activity, which has impacted how we operate our business. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to control it disrupted, and reduced the efficiency of, normal business activities in much of the world. We experienced some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain, including procuring necessary components and inputs, such as wafers and substrates, in a timely fashion, with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation. As a result of these supply chain disruptions, we increased customer order lead times and placed some products on allocation. We are also largely building semiconductor products to order and this has limited and may continue to limit our ability to fulfill orders and satisfy all of the demand for our products. \n\nThe pandemic resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures, such as travel restrictions quarantines, shelter-in-place order, and factory and office shutdowns, that impacted our workforce and \n\noperations, and those of our customers, CMs, suppliers and logistics providers. In addition, disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure impacted delivery times for materials and components to our facilities, transfers of our products to our key suppliers and, in some cases, our ability to timely ship our products to customers. This resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays, which could recur in the event of any future closures of, or periods of reduced operations at, our warehouse or the facilities of our suppliers and providers. \n\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. However, existing or new precautionary measures or modifications in our business practices and policies, may negatively impact our business or operations, especially if the spread of COVID-19 (including any variants) worsens significantly. In addition, any actions we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in a significant number of COVID-19-related claims. If a significant number of our employees, or employees and third parties performing key functions, including our Chief Executive Officer and members of our Board of Directors, become ill, our business may be further adversely impacted. In addition, changes to state workers&#8217; compensation laws, such as those in California, may increase our potential liability for such claims. See also our risk factor &#8220; If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. &#8221; \n\nThe degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the extent of actions to contain the virus (including any variants), availability and efficacy of the vaccines or other treatments, public acceptance of the vaccines (including boosters), and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners, including product inventory levels and product sell-through. \n\nWe sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners globally. Sales to distributors accounted for 56% of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 and are subject to a number of risks, including: \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in demand based on our distributors&#8217; product inventory levels and end customer demand; \n\n&#8226; our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers; \n\n&#8226; our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause; \n\n&#8226; our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end customers; and \n\n&#8226; our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute competing products and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these products. \n\nIn addition, we are selling our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors, which exposes us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks. \n\nWe do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products. As a result, our semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, including, for example, medical devices, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications. In such event, failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us, damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations. \n\nOur business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team. \n\nOur success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, and in particular, the services of Hock E. Tan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. None of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts. In addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. \n\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. \n\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our engineering and technical personnel (including cyber security experts) are a significant asset. Competition for these employees is significant in many areas of the world in which we operate, particularly \n\nin Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia where qualified engineers are in high demand. In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers, further limiting the pool of available talent. We believe equity awards provide a powerful long-term retention incentive and have historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees. However, the amendments to our 2012 Stock Incentive Plan approved by our stockholders in 2021 significantly reduced the number of shares available for equity awards. As a result, we may need to change our current equity granting philosophy, which could impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such personnel and provide competitive employment benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe failure to complete our acquisition of VMware, Inc. may adversely affect our business and our stock price. \n\nConsummation of the VMware Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, (ii) the receipt by VMware of a tax opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of certain aspects of the VMware Merger, (iii) the absence of certain orders or laws preventing consummation of the VMware Merger, (iv) authorization for listing additional shares of Broadcom common stock on Nasdaq, and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to either us or VMware. There can be no assurance that these or other closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Any delay in completing the acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits when expected, if at all. If the VMware Merger is not completed, our stock price could decline to the extent it reflects an assumption that we will complete the acquisition. Furthermore, if the VMware Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including incurring significant acquisition costs that we would be unable to recover, negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, including the termination by either us or VMware because certain required regulatory clearances are not obtained, upon termination we would be required to pay VMware a termination fee of $1.5 billion. \n\nFailure to realize the benefits expected from the VMware Merger could adversely affect the value of our common stock. \n\nAlthough we expect significant benefits to result from the VMware Merger, there can be no assurance that we will actually realize any of them, or realize them within the anticipated timeframe. Achieving these benefits will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate VMware's business successfully and efficiently. The challenges involved in this integration, which will be complex and time consuming, include the following: \n\n&#8226; preserving customer and other important relationships of VMware and attracting new business and operational relationships; \n\n&#8226; integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles; \n\n&#8226; consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures; \n\n&#8226; coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities; \n\n&#8226; coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated; and \n\n&#8226; integrating employees and related HR systems and benefits, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees. \n\nIf we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business, then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the VMware Merger on our anticipated timeframe or at all and our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. The successful integration of the VMware business will require significant management attention both before and after the completion of the VMware Merger, and may divert the attention of management from our business and operational issues. \n\nWe may pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities. \n\nAny acquisitions we may undertake, including the VMware Merger, and their integration involve risks and uncertainties, such as: \n\n&#8226; unexpected delays, challenges and related expenses, and disruption of our business; \n\n&#8226; diversion of management&#8217;s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities; \n\n&#8226; incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense, assuming liabilities (some of which may be unexpected) and ongoing or new lawsuits, potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements; \n\n&#8226; the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business, as well as implementing our own management information systems, operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations; \n\n&#8226; our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired business&#8217; products, financial disclosures, accounting practices, legal, tax and other contingencies, compliance with local laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) in the U.S. and multiple international jurisdictions; \n\n&#8226; additional acquisition-related debt, which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to borrow; \n\n&#8226; dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders; \n\n&#8226; difficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employees, vendors and customers; and \n\n&#8226; inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction, which may result in us not realizing the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction. \n\nIn addition, current and future changes to the U.S. and foreign regulatory approval process and requirements related to acquisitions, including the VMware Merger, may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated, not be forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions, which may prevent the transaction or jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and impede the execution of our business strategy. \n\nFrom time to time, we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business, either acquired or otherwise, or we may exit minority investments, any of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. Such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties, including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us, or at all, disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions. In addition, dispositions may include the transfer of technology and/or the licensing of certain IP rights to third-party purchasers, which could limit our ability to utilize such IP rights or assert these rights against such third-party purchasers or other third parties. \n\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings, including IP, securities litigation, and employee-related claims, which could, among other things, divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of our IP rights. \n\nWe are often involved in legal proceedings, including cases involving our IP rights and those of others, commercial matters, acquisition-related suits, securities class action suits, employee-related claims and other actions. Litigation or settlement of such actions, regardless of their merit, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel. \n\nThe industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including actions by patent-holding companies that do not make or sell products. From time to time, third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their IP rights to technologies that are important to our business. For example, in August 2020 judgment was entered against Broadcom and Apple for infringement of certain patents and California Institute of Technology was awarded past damages of $270.2 million from Broadcom and $837.8 million from Apple, for which Apple is seeking indemnification from Broadcom. Although the appellate court recently vacated these damages and ordered a new trial, there are no assurances that we will be successful or what, if any, damages we will be required to pay. \n\nMany of our customer agreements, and in some cases our asset sale agreements, and/or the laws of certain jurisdictions may require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party IP infringement claims, including costs to defend those claims, and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings. However, our CMs and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such third-party claims. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to: \n\n&#8226; cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology and/or make changes to our processes or products; \n\n&#8226; pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology, including up to treble damages if willful infringement is found; \n\n&#8226; expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology; \n\n&#8226; license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; \n\n&#8226; enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall IP portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories; \n\n&#8226; pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or \n\n&#8226; relinquish IP rights associated with one or more of our patent claims. \n\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn addition, we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with such litigation. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals, as well as stockholder derivative suits; civil or criminal fines and penalties; legal and other expenses; and expenses associated with the remedial measure, if any, which may be imposed. \n\nOur operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations. \n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, these factors include, among others: \n\n&#8226; the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in end-user demand for our customers&#8217; the products; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers; \n\n&#8226; the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers; \n\n&#8226; the timing of new software contracts and renewals, as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any pre-paid amounts under the contract; \n\n&#8226; our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies; \n\n&#8226; the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue; \n\n&#8226; new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors; \n\n&#8226; seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets; \n\n&#8226; timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies; and \n\n&#8226; timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, and tax reform. \n\nThe foregoing factors are often difficult to predict, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time. \n\nFailure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWe make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements, which may not be accurate. \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges. More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income. \n\nConversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. If we are unable to meet such increases in demand, this could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities. \n\nWinning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue. \n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as &#8220;design wins&#8221;. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes. \n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a customer&#8217;s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses. Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles. \n\nCompetition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue. \n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets. \n\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who develop competing products. \n\nIn addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection than us. \n\nThe actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nA prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations, or those of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nAlthough we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are located in California and the Pacific Rim region, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the Czech Republic, India, Israel and the U.S., with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas, and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia. \n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses, especially our Colorado, Singapore, Malaysia and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. To date, we have not experienced a material event, however such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWe may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks. Such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations. \n\nAn impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nOur business depends on various internally managed IT systems and outsourced IT services, including cloud-based and other critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, financial reporting, product orders and shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network development, network monitoring and electronic communication services, as well as third-party data centers. Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect. Although these systems are designed to protect and secure our customers&#8217;, suppliers&#8217; and employees&#8217; confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use (including technologies produced by us) have occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmanaged, could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed. \n\nCyber-attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, are well-financed, in some cases supported by state actors, and are designed to not only attack, but also to evade detection. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems, or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Geopolitical instability, such as Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, may increase the likelihood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure. Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the systems of our service providers, or the existence of computer viruses or malware (such as ransomware) in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss, business disruption, and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees or third parties. Such an event could disrupt our business and result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, significant remediation costs, disruption of key business operations and significant diversion of our resources, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations (such as the General Data Protection Regulation), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a result of a vendor&#8217;s failure to perform, we may be unable to collect any damages. \n\nDespite our internal controls and investment in security measures, we have, from time to time, been subject to disruptive cyber-attacks or there have been attempts of unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT networks. Although no such cyber security incidents have been material to Broadcom, we continue to devote resources to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future. \n\nU.S. and foreign regulators have also increased their focus on cyber security vulnerabilities and risks. Compliance with laws and regulations concerning privacy, cyber security, data governance, and data protection could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties. Further, customers and service providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual, certification and audit provisions regarding privacy, cyber security, data governance, data protection, confidentiality, and IP, which may also increase our overall compliance burden. \n\nOur gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product mix, price erosion, acquisitions we may make, level of capacity utilization and commodity prices. \n\nOur gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets. A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products, as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and non-product revenue, could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages. In addition, increased competition and the existence of product alternatives, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand, industry oversupply or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors, and other factors have in the past and may in the future lead to further price erosion, lower revenue and lower margin. Conversely, periods of robust demand that create a supply imbalance, as we have seen recently, can lead to higher gross margins that may not be sustainable over the longer term. \n\nIn addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment, leading to high fixed costs, including depreciation expense. If we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin. Furthermore, we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices, some of which are very volatile, and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin. \n\nOur gross margin may also be adversely affected if businesses or companies that we acquire have different gross margin profiles and by expenses related to such acquisitions. \n\nWe utilize a significant amount of IP in our business. If we are unable or fail to protect our IP, our business could be adversely affected. \n\nOur success depends in part upon protecting our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants. We spend significant resources to monitor and protect our IP rights, including the unauthorized use of our products, usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell, and even with significant expenditures, we may not be able to protect the IP rights that are valuable to our business. We are unable to predict or assure that: \n\n&#8226; our IP rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or, in the case of third-party IP rights licensed to us, be licensed to others; \n\n&#8226; our IP rights will provide competitive advantages to us; \n\n&#8226; rights previously granted by third parties to IP licensed or assigned to us, including portfolio cross-licenses, will not hamper our ability to assert our IP rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes; \n\n&#8226; any of our pending or future patent, trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; \n\n&#8226; our IP rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal protection may be weak; or \n\n&#8226; we have sufficient IP rights to protect our products or our business. \n\nEffective IP protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions, relative to those protections available in the U.S., and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions. In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us. \n\nWe also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our IP. Licensing of our IP rights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights. In addition, we may acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties. These licensing obligations may extend to our own IP following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our IP rights. From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights, including, in some cases, against our customers and suppliers. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. Conversely, third parties have and may in the future pursue IP litigation against us, including as a result of our IP licensing business. An adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our IP rights and limit the value of our technology, including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments, which could otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nFrom time to time, we may need to obtain additional IP licenses or renew existing license agreements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all. \n\nIf our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and services could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business. \n\nWe may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems, systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities. W e must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments. \n\nFurther, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties. If we lose access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software. In addition, if software providers and hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest vendors, adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access, this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products. Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow. \n\nFailure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business. \n\nMany of our existing customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts. Customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors, any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, if at all. The failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow. \n\nCertain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future, which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense. \n\nSome of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties, some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the inability to \n\nmaintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products. \n\nCertain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. \n\nSome of our products contain software from open source code sources, the use of which may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available. Further, although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements, it is common for such software to be available &#8220;as-is&#8221; with no warranty, indemnity or support. Although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions, such use, under certain circumstances, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts. \n\nFailure of our software products to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nCertain aspects of our software products are intended to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments, and as a result, we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cyber security attacks. Open source code or other third-party software used in these products could also be targeted. Although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents, we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers. Additionally, efforts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, or modification of our software, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers. A successful cyber security attack involving our products could cause customers and potential customers to believe our services are ineffective or unreliable and result in, among other things, the loss of customers, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty in marketing our products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations and give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions or indemnification obligations under our agreements. Any such event could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations. See also &#8220; An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business &#8221;. \n\nWe are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability. \n\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to significant expense. Our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions, relating to product quality issues. The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some cases, including in agreements with some of our largest customers, are potentially unlimited. Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future. \n\nProduct liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. For example, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices. In such an event, we may incur significant costs and expenses, including among others, replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims. Conversely, in some cases, amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed. \n\nThe complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs, which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely affect our operating costs. \n\nHighly complex products, such as those we offer, may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions, software documentation or enhancements are released, or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development. If any of our products or third-party components used in our products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully design workarounds. Furthermore, if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs. Significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third-party software \n\napplications and databases. As a result, if there is system-wide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer&#8217;s system, it can be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier&#8217;s product. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. To resolve these problems, we may have to invest significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose, or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others. For example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer&#8217;s end-product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays. As a result, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. \n\nWe make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles and evolving industry standards, and new delivery methods. In addition, semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. \n\nWe collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business. \n\nWe collect, use and store (collectively, &#8220;process&#8221;) a high volume, variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business. This creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business, depending on the type of personal information, the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Privacy legislation and other data protection regulations, enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Sectoral legislation, certification requirements and technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers, such as those is the financial services or public sector, are likely to further exacerbate this trend. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. Concerns about government interference, sovereignty, expanding privacy, cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers and our products and services, particularly in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and our own data management practices. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy, data governance or cyber security obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, substantial fines and damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. \n\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase our costs, restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations relating to the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to hazardous materials. Compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could, among other things, require us to modify our manufacturing processes, restrict our ability to expand our facilities, or require us to acquire pollution control equipment, all of which can be very costly. Any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment. In addition, complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nChanging requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products, including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronic products sold in various countries, including the U.S., China and Japan, and in the European Union, increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to re-engineer our products. Such re-engineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may also experience claims from employees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims. \n\nSocial and environmental regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors. \n\nThere is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, particularly with OEMs that manufacture consumer electronics. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies, practices and metrics. In addition, various jurisdictions are developing climate change-based laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as investor expectations, on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers or CMs to comply, with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. \n\nIn addition, as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers&#8217; demands, which may harm our sales and operating results. \n\nThe average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross profit. \n\nThe semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications. As a result, the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly. Gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by, among other things, pricing pressures from our customers. In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. In addition, some of our customer agreements provide for volume-based pricing and product pricing roadmaps, which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time. Our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing manufacturing costs, or developing new and higher value-added products on a timely basis. \n\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses. \n\nWe operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. However, some of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar could result in substantial changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transactions into U.S. dollars. \n\nIn the normal course of business, we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks, including the use of derivative instruments. These strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in financial losses. \n\nRisks Related to Our Taxes \n\nChanges in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. \n\nCorporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many jurisdictions. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation has been, and will likely continue to be, proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate. \n\nAfter enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most of our income is taxable in the U.S. with a significant portion taxable under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) regime. Beginning in fiscal year 2027, the deduction allowable under the GILTI regime will decrease from 50% to 37.5%, which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income. The U.S. also enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) in August 2022, which creates a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of consolidated GAAP pre-tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of $1 billion. The book minimum tax will first apply to our fiscal year 2024 and any increase in our effective tax rate or cash tax will depend on a number of factors, including any offsets for foreign tax credits or general business credits, or changes in book income following business combinations. The IRA also creates an excise tax of 1% of the value of any stock repurchased by us after December 31, 2022. We could be subject to this new excise tax, but the amount will vary depending on various factors, including the amount and frequency of any stock repurchases, applicability in certain business combination transactions, and any permitted reductions or exceptions to the amount subject to the tax. If (i) the U.S. tax rate increases, (ii) the deduction allowable under the GILTI regime is further reduced or eliminated, (iii) additional limitations are put on our ability to deduct interest expense, or (iv) the requirement for research and development costs to be capitalized beginning in fiscal year 2023 remains in effect, our provision for income taxes, net income, and cash flows would be adversely impacted. \n\nIn addition, many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#8217;s (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the &#8220;Pillar One&#8221; and &#8220;Pillar Two&#8221; proposals). Some countries intend to implement laws based on Pillar Two proposals, which may adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change. \n\nAny substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally. \n\nIf the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason, or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect, our corporate income taxes could significantly increase. \n\nOur operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. For example, absent our principal tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, which is scheduled to expire in 2025, the corporate income tax rate that would apply to our Singapore taxable income would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028. Each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may, in some instances, be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday, we could, in some instances, be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled. In addition, we may be required, or elect, to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive, which could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive. Our tax incentives could also be adversely impacted if the global minimum tax provisions (Pillar Two) are adopted in a country in which we have an existing tax incentive. Our tax incentives and tax holiday, before taking into consideration U.S. foreign tax credits, decreased the provision for income taxes by approximately $ 1,821 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by $4.31 for fiscal year 2022. \n\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. \n\nOur income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could materially, adversely affect financial results. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally, our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which \n\nwe are required to file tax returns. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. \n\nOur income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including: \n\n&#8226; reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, tangible and intangible assets, outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure; \n\n&#8226; jurisdictional mix of our income and assets; \n\n&#8226; changes in the allocation of income and expenses, including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure, acquisitions or tax law; \n\n&#8226; changes in U.S and foreign tax laws and regulations, changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, taxation of U.S. income generated from foreign sources, the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules; \n\n&#8226; tax effects of increases in non-deductible employee compensation; and \n\n&#8226; changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n\nWe have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services, the sale of products, the arrangement of financing and the grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm&#8217;s length basis. Our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm&#8217;s length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm&#8217;s length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of comprehensive treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, result in adjustments for prior or future years. The effects of any such changes could subject us to higher taxes and our earnings, results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, we are subject to, and are under, tax audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. The ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. \n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness \n\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy. \n\nAs of October 30, 2022, the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was $41,218 million. This amount does not reflect any debt we expect to incur or assume in connection with the VMware Merger. \n\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including: \n\n&#8226; increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions; \n\n&#8226; exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities, which we do not typically hedge against; \n\n&#8226; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry; \n\n&#8226; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and \n\n&#8226; potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs. \n\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. While we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies, we may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could: \n\n&#8226; adversely affect the trading price of, or market for, our debt securities; \n\n&#8226; increase interest expense under our term facilities; \n\n&#8226; increase the cost of, and adversely affect our ability to refinance, our existing debt; and \n\n&#8226; adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt. \n\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business. \n\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business, to plan for, or react to, changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt, enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable grace period, the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. In such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt. \n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, and to refinance our debt, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed, which could result in a default on our indebtedness. \n\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock \n\nAt times, our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future, which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management&#8217;s attention and resources. \n\nThe trading price of our common stock has, at times, fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, and others, including: \n\n&#8226; issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; \n\n&#8226; announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors; \n\n&#8226; announcements of, or expectations of, additional debt or equity financing transactions; \n\n&#8226; stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock; \n\n&#8226; hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock; and \n\n&#8226; unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business. \n\nThese fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. In addition, we have been, and in the future we may be, subject to lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions, including the VMware Merger. Securities litigation against us, including the lawsuits related to such acquisitions, could result in substantial costs and divert our management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. \n\nThe amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate. \n\nThe amount, timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. These purposes include operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, repayment of debt and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Changes in cash flows, tax laws and our stock price could also impact our stock repurchase program. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. \n\nA substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our common stock by one or more of these holders could cause our stock price to fall. \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, we believe 10 of our 20 largest holders of common stock were active institutional investors who held approximately 27% of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate. These investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress the market price of our common stock. In addition, any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. \n\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends. \n\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. \n\n"

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \n\nMarket Information \n\nBroadcom common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;AVGO&#8221;. \n\nHolders \n\nAs of November 25, 2022, there were 1,060 holders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater number of stockholders are &#8220;street name&#8221; or beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions. \n\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities \n\nOn August 1, 2022, we issued 9,923 restricted shares of our common stock to one individual in connection with our acquisition of a company. The restrictions lapse over three years subject to the individual's continued employment. The issuance of these shares was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) thereof. \n\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities \n\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended October 30, 2022, we paid approximately $274 million in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards. We withheld approximately 1 million shares of common stock from employees in connection with such net share settlement at an average price of $502.62 per share. These shares may be deemed to be &#8220;issuer purchases&#8221; of shares. \n\nIn December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of our common stock from time to time on or prior to December 31, 2022. During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for $7 billion under this stock repurchase program. \n\nIn May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock from time to time through December 31, 2023. \n\nRepurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be effected through a variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated purchases. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated at any time. \n\nStock Performance Graph \n\nThe following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total return for our common stock, the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500 Stock Index (the &#8220;S&#38;P 500 Index&#8221;) and the NASDAQ 100 Index for the five fiscal years ended October 30, 2022.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThis Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nThe following section generally discusses our financial condition and results of operations for our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 (&#8220;fiscal year 2022&#8221;) compared to our fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 (&#8220;fiscal year 2021&#8221;). A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to our fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 (&#8220;fiscal year 2020&#8221;) can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on December 17, 2021. \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security. We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking (&#8220;FC SAN&#8221;) products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products. \n\nWe have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Our semiconductor solutions segment includes all of our product lines and intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) licensing. Our infrastructure software segment includes our mainframe, distributed and cyber security solutions, and our FC SAN business. \n\nOur strategy is to combine best-of-breed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, with unmatched scale, on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world&#8217;s leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisitions of category-leading businesses and technologies, as well as investing extensively in research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology leadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results. \n\nThe demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the following: \n\n&#8226; gain or loss of significant customers; \n\n&#8226; general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete; \n\n&#8226; our distributors&#8217; product inventory and end customer demand; \n\n&#8226; the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets; \n\n&#8226; the shift to cloud-based information technology solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers; and \n\n&#8226; the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders. \n\nCOVID-19 Update \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to control it disrupted, and reduced the efficiency of, normal business activities in much of the world. The pandemic resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures that created supply chain and market disruption, impacting our workforce and operations, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers, suppliers and logistics providers. \n\nWhile the demand environment for our semiconductor products was consistent with our expectations for fiscal year 2022, with robust and increased profitability driven by the supply imbalance, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term. We continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain, including with respect to wafers and substrates. Although supply lead times have stabilized, we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner to meet demand. \n\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. We continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our operations and may modify our business practices and policies from time to time. \n\nOur ability to predict the impact of the pandemic on our business remains limited and its effects on our business are unlikely to be fully realized, or reflected in our financial results, until future periods. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nHighlights during fiscal year 2022 include the following: \n\n&#8226; We generated $16,736 million of cash from operations. \n\n&#8226; We paid $7,032 million in cash dividends. \n\n&#8226; We repurchased $7,000 million of common stock. \n\nPending Acquisition of VMware, Inc. \n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;VMware Merger Agreement&#8221;) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. (&#8220;VMware&#8221;) in a cash-and-stock transaction (the &#8220;VMware Merger&#8221;) that values VMware at approximately $61 billion, based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware&#8217;s closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash. \n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger. \n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit (&#8220;RSU&#8221;) awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts. \n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors. \n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion. \n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 (&#8220;fiscal year 2023&#8221;), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion. \n\nNet Revenue \n\nA majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products, as well as from modules, switches and subsystems. Net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan, develop, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms. \n\nOur overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments, have varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end- \n\nmarket demand, including the effects of seasonality, which are discussed in detail in Part I, Item 1. Business under &#8220;Seasonality&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nDistributors and original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;), or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer&#8217;s organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers&#8217; requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances. \n\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stock-based compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, inventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, and acquisition costs, which include direct transaction costs and acquisition-related costs. \n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins. \n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense. \n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges. \n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process. \n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses. \n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development (&#8220;IPR&#38;D&#8221;), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with the acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&#38;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives. \n\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges. Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, facility and lease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&#38;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements. \n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments. \n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items. \n\nProvision for income taxes. We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire in November 2025. The corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in 2028. \n\nEach tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with any such operating conditions specified, we could, in some instances, be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled. We may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. Before taking into consideration the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to decrease the provision for income taxes by approximately $1,821 million and $1,156 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm&#8217;s length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm&#8217;s length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes. See Note 2. &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates. \n\nRevenue recognition. We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party&#8217;s rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. Our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services. \n\nWe recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus, the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods. \n\nValuation of goodwill and long-lived assets. We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. To review for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit&#8217;s net book value. \n\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance, including revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows. The market approach is based on weighting the financial multiples of comparable companies and applying a control premium. A reporting unit's carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt. \n\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including purchased IPR&#38;D, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include: (i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects of our business or the part of our business to which the long-lived assets relate. We also consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived assets stated on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect their estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. \n\nIncome taxes. Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. We have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. An adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition. \n\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes, interest, and penalties will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to tax expense would be required. If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist. \n\nFiscal Year Presentation \n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week year and the first Sunday in November in a 53-week year. Our fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of 52 weeks. \n\nThe financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with GAAP and expressed in U.S. dollars. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021 \n\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 &#160; (In millions) (As a percentage of net revenue) Statements of Operations Data: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net revenue: Products $ 26,277 $ 20,886 79 % 76 % Subscriptions and services 6,926 6,564 21 24 Total net revenue 33,203 27,450 100 100 Cost of revenue: Cost of products sold 7,629 6,555 23 24 Cost of subscriptions and services 627 607 2 2 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 2,847 3,427 8 13 Restructuring charges 5 17 &#8212; &#8212; Total cost of revenue 11,108 10,606 33 39 Gross margin 22,095 16,844 67 61 Research and development 4,919 4,854 15 18 Selling, general and administrative 1,382 1,347 4 5 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 1,512 1,976 5 7 Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges 57 148 &#8212; &#8212; Total operating expenses 7,870 8,325 24 30 Operating income $ 14,225 $ 8,519 43 % 31 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Revenue \n\nA relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales of products to distributors accounted for 56% and 53% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Direct sales to WT Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a distributor, accounted for 20% and 18% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nFrom time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. This is particularly true of our wireless products as fluctuations may be magnified by the timing of launches, and seasonal variations in sales, of mobile devices. The COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties may cause our net revenue to fluctuate significantly and impact our results of operations. \n\nAlthough we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by country based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by our distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers. In each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, approximately 35% of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to China (including Hong Kong). However, the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other than China (including Hong Kong). As a result, we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers&#8217; product incorporating our product, to end customers located in China (including Hong Kong). \n\nThe following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended Net Revenue by Segment October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 $ Change % Change (In millions, except percentages) Semiconductor solutions $ 25,818 $ 20,383 $ 5,435 27 % Infrastructure software 7,385 7,067 318 4 % Total net revenue $ 33,203 $ 27,450 $ 5,753 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended Net Revenue by Segment October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (As a percentage of net revenue) Semiconductor solutions 78 % 74 % Infrastructure software 22 26 Total net revenue 100 % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment increased due to strong product demand, primarily for networking, server storage and broadband products, as well as higher demand for our wireless content in mobile devices. Net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our mainframe solutions and FC SAN products. \n\nGross Margin \n\nGross margin was $22,095 million, or 67% of net revenue, for fiscal year 2022, compared to $16,844 million, or 61% of net revenue, for fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, mainly from our 2016 acquisition of Broadcom Corporation and, to a lesser extent, favorable margin within our semiconductor solutions segment. \n\nResearch and Development Expense \n\nResearch and development expense increased $65 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher variable employee compensation expense and engineering project costs, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense reflecting the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effects of forfeitures. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $35 million, or 3%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher variable employee compensation expense, offset in part by lower stock-based compensation expense. \n\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets \n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased $464 million, or 23%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of certain intangible assets from our acquisition of CA, Inc. \n\nRestructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges \n\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges recognized in operating expenses decreased $91 million, or 61%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year . The decrease was primarily due to lower employee termination costs following the completion of key restructuring activities from acquisitions. \n\nStock-Based Compensation Expense \n\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was $1,533 million and $1,704 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease primarily reflects the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effect of forfeitures. \n\nThe following table sets forth the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards outstanding and expected to vest as of October 30, 2022, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-average service period of 2.7 years. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year: Unrecognized Compensation Cost, Net of Expected Forfeitures (In millions) 2023 $ 1,221 2024 846 2025 507 2026 130 Total $ 2,704 ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year ended November 3, 2019 (&#8220;fiscal year 2019&#8221;), our Compensation Committee approved a broad-based program of multi-year equity grants of time- and market-based RSUs (the &#8220;Multi-Year Equity Awards&#8221;) in lieu of our annual employee equity awards historically granted on March 15 of each year. Each Multi-Year Equity Award vests on the same basis as four annual grants made March 15 of each year, beginning in fiscal year 2019, with successive four-year vesting periods. We recognize stock-based compensation expense related to the Multi-Year Equity Awards from the grant date through their respective vesting date, ranging from 4 years to 7 years. \n\nSegment Operating Results \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended Operating Income by Segment October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 $ Change % Change (In millions, except percentages) Semiconductor solutions $ 15,075 $ 10,976 $ 4,099 37 % Infrastructure software 5,219 4,936 283 6 % Unallocated expenses (6,069) (7,393) 1,324 (18) % Total operating income $ 14,225 $ 8,519 $ 5,706 67 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating income from our semiconductor solutions segment increased primarily due to higher net revenue from networking, server storage, broadband, and wireless products, as well as higher gross margin. Operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our mainframe solutions and FC SAN products. \n\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; restructuring, impairment and disposal charges; acquisition-related costs; and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses decreased 18% in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. \n\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses \n\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $1,737 million and $1,885 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower losses on extinguishment of debt. We expect to incur additional interest expense in future periods as a result of indebtedness associated with the pending VMware Merger. \n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items. Other expense, net, was $54 million for fiscal year 2022, compared to other income, net, of $131 million for fiscal year 2021. The change was primarily due to changes in investment gains or losses. \n\nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was $939 million and $29 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations before income taxes. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible. \n\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of October 30, 2022 consisted of: (i) $12,416 million in cash and cash equivalents, (ii) cash we expect to generate from operations and (iii) available capacity under our $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit \n\nfacility (the &#8220;Revolving Facility&#8221;). In addition, we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financing from time to time. \n\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, including the pending VMware Merger, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our Board of Directors), (v) interest and principal payments related to our $41,218 million of outstanding indebtedness, (vi) share repurchases, and (vii) payment of income taxes. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. Our debt and liquidity needs will increase as a result of the pending VMware Merger, and we intend to fund the cash portion of the consideration with $32 billion in new, fully committed debt financing. \n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations, and the Revolving Facility, as well as the committed debt funding related to the pending VMware Merger, will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months. For additional information regarding our cash requirement from contractual obligations, indebtedness and lease obligations, see Note 14. &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221;, Note 10. &#8220;Borrowings&#8221; and Note 6. &#8220;Leases&#8221; in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction, or evaluation of potential transactions, could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances, we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing. However, we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service our senior unsecured notes and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above. \n\nIn addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such tenders, exchanges or purchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. \n\nWorking Capital \n\nWorking capital increased to $11,452 million at October 30, 2022 from $10,305 million at October 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to the following: \n\n&#8226; Accounts receivable increased to $2,958 million at October 30, 2022 from $2,071 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to revenue linearity and less receivables sold through factoring arrangements. \n\n&#8226; Inventory increased to $1,925 million at October 30, 2022 from $1,297 million at October 31, 2021, primarily to support customer demand and due to higher material costs. \n\n&#8226; Cash and cash equivalents increased to $12,416 million at October 30, 2022 from $12,163 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to $16,736 million in net cash provided by operating activities and $1,935 million in proceeds from long-term borrowings, partially offset by $7,032 million of dividend payments, $7,000 million of common stock repurchases, $2,361 million of debt payments, and $1,455 million of employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards. \n\n&#8226; Other current assets increased to $1,205 million at October 30, 2022 from $1,055 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in prepaid taxes, offset in part by a decrease in short-term investments. \n\nThese increases in working capital were offset in part by the following: \n\n&#8226; Other current liabilities increased to $4,412 million at October 30, 2022 from $3,839 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in contract liabilities, taxes payable and interest payable. \n\n&#8226; Current portion of long-term debt increased to $440 million at October 30, 2022 from $290 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to certain debt instruments becoming due within the next twelve months, offset in part by repayments. \n\n&#8226; Employee compensation and benefits increased to $1,202 million at October 30, 2022 from $1,066 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to higher variable compensation based on current fiscal year performance. \n\nCapital Returns \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended Cash Dividends Declared and Paid October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions, except per share data) Dividends per share to common stockholders $ 16.40 $ 14.40 Dividends to common stockholders $ 6,733 $ 5,913 Dividends per share to preferred stockholders $ 80.00 $ 80.00 Dividends to preferred stockholders $ 299 $ 299 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of our common stock from time to time on or prior to December 31, 2022. During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for $7 billion under this stock repurchase program. In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock from time to time through December 31, 2023. \n\nRepurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be effected through a variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated purchases. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated at any time. \n\nDuring fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we paid approximately $1,455 million and $1,299 million, respectively, in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards. We withheld approximately 3 million shares of common stock from employees in connection with such net share settlements during each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021. \n\nCash Flows \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 16,736 $ 13,764 Net cash used in investing activities (667) (245) Net cash used in financing activities (15,816) (8,974) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 253 $ 4,545 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nCash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash and other items and changes in assets and liabilities. The $2,972 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was due to $4,759 million higher net income and certain non-cash adjustments including deferred taxes and other non-cash taxes, offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation, as well as a $1,527 million decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nCash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures, and sales and purchases of investments. The $422 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $238 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions and $169 million lower net proceeds from sales of investments. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of dividend payments, stock repurchases, proceeds and payments related to our long-term borrowings, and employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards. The $6,842 million increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily \n\ndue to $7,000 million in common stock repurchases, a $820 million increase in dividend payments, and a $156 million increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards, offset in part by a $1,165 million change in net borrowing activities. \n\nAccounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards \n\nFor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, in our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2. &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk \n\nFrom time to time, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates, which result from our global operating and financing activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts, were not significant for any period presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. As of October 30, 2022, we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nChanges in interest rates affect the fair value of our outstanding debt. As of October 30, 2022, we had $41.2 billion in principal amount of debt outstanding. The carrying amount of the debt was $39.5 billion, and the estimated aggregate fair value of debt was $33.0 billion. As of October 30, 2022, a hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of debt by a decrease or increase of approximately $1.6 billion. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our debt as we only had fixed rate senior notes outstanding. To hedge variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into treasury rate lock contracts. \n\n"

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal 2020. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \n\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions (UTPs) \n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the gross unrecognized tax benefits balance was $5,117 million as of October 30, 2022. As management has disclosed, management evaluates the exposure associated with various tax filing positions and accrues an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition. A tax benefit from an UTP may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the UTPs is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when evaluating the technical merits of these tax positions, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the technical merits of the tax positions, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the income tax liability for UTPs, including controls addressing the completeness of the UTPs and the measurement of the income tax liability. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management&#8217;s process for identifying potential new UTPs, (ii) for a selection of UTPs, evaluating possible outcomes, and (iii) for a selection of UTPs, testing the calculation of the income tax liability by jurisdiction, including management&#8217;s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in (i) the evaluation of the completeness of management&#8217;s identification of the UTPs and (ii) for a selection of UTPs, the evaluation of the reasonableness of management&#8217;s assessment of whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained, the amount of potential benefit to be realized, and the application of relevant tax laws. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSan Jose, California \n\nDecember 16, 2022 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2006. \n\nBROADCOM INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions, except par value) ASSETS &#160;

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to &#8220;Broadcom,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries. \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week year and the first Sunday in November in a 53-week year. Our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 (&#8220;fiscal year 2022&#8221;) was a 52-week fiscal year. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended on January 30, 2022, the second quarter ended on May 1, 2022 and the third quarter ended on July 31, 2022. Our fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 (&#8220;fiscal year 2021&#8221;) and fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 (&#8220;fiscal year 2020&#8221;) were both 52-week fiscal years. \n\nOn November 4, 2019, we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security business (the &#8220;Symantec Business&#8221;). We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. See Note 13. &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; for additional information. \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \n\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented. \n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The inputs into certain of these estimates and assumptions include the consideration of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of these estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods. \n\nCash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our cash and cash equivalents at the time of purchase. \n\nTrade accounts receivable, net. Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information, among other factors. Allowances for doubtful accounts were not material as of October 30, 2022 or October 31, 2021. Accounts receivable are also recognized net of sales returns and distributor credit allowances. These amounts are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discounts will be granted or products will be returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021 were $ 126 million and $ 129 million, respectively. \n\nConcentrations of credit risk and significant customers. Our cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents may be redeemable upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We seek to mitigate our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profile of these counterparties. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located both within and outside the U.S. We mitigate collection risks from our customers by performing regular credit evaluations of our customers&#8217; financial conditions, and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. \n\nConcentration of other risks. We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities, general economic conditions worldwide, the ability to safeguard patents and other intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) in a rapidly evolving market and reliance on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer fabricators and independent distributors and other factors could affect our financial results. \n\nInventory. We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value of the inventory, with cost being determined under the first-in, first-out method. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements. The excess and obsolete balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess and obsolete inventory charge and the written-down value of the inventory becomes its new cost basis. \n\nRetirement benefit plans. For defined benefit pension plans, we consider various factors in determining our respective benefit obligations and net periodic benefit (income) cost, including the number of employees that we expect to receive benefits, their salary levels and years of service, the expected return on plan assets, the discount rate, the timing of the payment of benefits, and other actuarial assumptions. If the actual results and events of the benefit plans differ from our current assumptions, the benefit obligations may be over- or under-valued. \n\nThe key assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The U.S. discount rates are based on a hypothetical yield curve constructed using high-quality corporate bonds selected to yield cash flows that match the expected timing and amount of the benefit payments. The U.S. expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully-matched, liability-driven investment strategy. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. For the non-U.S. plans, we set assumptions specific to each country. We have elected to measure defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities as of October 31, which is the month end that is closest to our fiscal year end. \n\nDerivative instruments. We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. \n\nOutstanding derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at their fair values based on Level 2 inputs, as defined in the fair value hierarchy. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value are initially recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in the period of change, and are subsequently reclassified and recognized in the same line item as the hedged item when either the hedged transactions affect earnings or it becomes probable that the hedged transactions will not occur. \n\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and the changes in fair value are recognized in other income (expense), net in the period of change. We did not have any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of October 30, 2022 or October 31, 2021. The gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net for derivative instruments not designated as hedges were not material. \n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we entered into treasury rate lock contracts that mature in approximately one year to hedge variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances. These treasury rate locks are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedging instruments. As of October 30, 2022, the total notional amount of these contracts was $ 1.3 billion, and the fair value of these contracts was $ 47 million, which was recorded as a derivative asset with the gains recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet. \n\nProperty, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized, and maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Assets are held in construction in progress until placed in service, upon which date, we begin to depreciate these assets. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our property, plant and equipment balances and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Buildings and leasehold improvements are generally depreciated over 15 to 40 years, \n\nor over the lease period, whichever is shorter, and machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over 3 to 10 years. We use the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment. \n\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months, and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the effects of collateral. Operating and finance lease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on the effective-interest method over the lease term. \n\nFair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). \n\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurements are described below: \n\nLevel 1 &#8212; Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, banker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds. We measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions. \n\nLevel 2 &#8212; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n\nLevel 3 &#8212; Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired. Quantitative information for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and financial indicators of the investee's ability to continue as a going concern. \n\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technology obsolescence rates, expected costs to develop in-process research and development (&#8220;IPR&#38;D&#8221;) into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \n\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. To review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. Those factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit&#8217;s net book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its net book value, there is no impairment. Otherwise, we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. \n\nLong-lived assets. Purchased finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized over the periods during which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to our cash flows. Purchased IPR&#38;D projects are capitalized at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&#38;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives. If an IPR&#38;D project is abandoned, we recognize the carrying value of the related intangible asset in our consolidated statements of operations in the period it is abandoned. On a quarterly basis, we monitor factors and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include: (i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, and (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. An impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (or asset group) is less than the net book value of the asset (or asset group). The amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset (or asset group) and the estimated fair value. \n\nWarranty. We accrue for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. Product warranty costs are estimated based upon our historical experience and specific identification of the product requirements, which may fluctuate based on product mix. Additionally, we accrue for warranty costs associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. \n\nRevenue recognition. &#160; We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party&#8217;s rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. \n\nNature of Products and Services \n\nOur products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services. The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue. \n\nProducts. We recognize revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. Rebates and incentives offered to distributors, which are earned when sales to end customers are completed, are estimated at the point of revenue recognition. We have elected to exclude from the transaction price any taxes collected from a customer and to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the product as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product. From time to time, certain customers agree to pay us secure supply fees in exchange for prioritized fulfillment of product orders. Such fees are included in the transaction price of the product orders and are recognized as revenue in the period that control over the products is transferred to the customer. \n\nSubscriptions and services. Our subscriptions and services revenue consists of sales and royalties from software arrangements, support services, professional services, transfer of IP, and non-recurring engineering (&#8220;NRE&#8221;) arrangements. \n\nRevenue from software arrangements primarily consists of fees, which may be paid either at contract inception or in \n\ninstallments over the contract term, that provide customers with a right to use the software, access general support and maintenance, and utilize our professional services. \n\nOur software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers derive benefit, and the customer obtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download. We believe that for the majority of software arrangements, customers derive significant benefit from the ongoing support we provide. The majority of our subscriptions and services arrangements permit our customers to unilaterally terminate or cancel these arrangements at any time at the customer&#8217;s convenience, referred to as termination for convenience provisions, without substantive termination penalty and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees. Accordingly, we account for arrangements with these termination for convenience provisions as a series of daily contracts, resulting in ratable revenue recognition of software revenue over the contractual period. \n\nSupport services consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Support services represent stand-ready obligations for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. \n\nProfessional services consist of implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services. The obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations. \n\nRights to our IP are either sold or licensed to a customer. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize IP revenue upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sales or usages occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated. \n\nThere are two main categories of NRE contracts that we enter into with our customers: (a) NRE contracts in which we develop a custom chip and (b) NRE contracts in which we accelerate our development of a new chip upon the customer&#8217;s request. The majority of our NRE contract revenues meet the over time criteria. As such, revenue is recognized over the development period with the measure of progress using the input method based on costs incurred to total cost as the services are provided. For NRE contracts that do not meet the over time criteria, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the NRE services are complete. \n\nMaterial rights. Contracts with customers may also include material rights that are also performance obligations. These include the right to renew or receive products or services at a discounted price in the future. Revenue allocated to material rights is recognized when the customer exercises the right or the right expires. \n\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations \n\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. \n\nAllocation of consideration. We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in a bundled arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. \n\nStandalone selling price. When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations. When directly observable transactions are not available, our estimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors, including, but not limited to, historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, technology lifecycles and market conditions. \n\nWe separately determine the standalone selling prices by product or service type. Additionally, we segment the standalone selling prices for products where the pricing strategies differ, and where there are differences in customers and circumstances that warrant segmentation. \n\nWe also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights. We estimate the value of the customer&#8217;s option to purchase or receive additional products or services at a discounted price by estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised. \n\nOther Policies and Judgments \n\nContract modifications. We may modify contracts to offer customers additional products or services. Each of the additional products and services is generally considered distinct from those products or services transferred to the customer before the modification. We evaluate whether the contract price for the additional products and services reflects the \n\nstandalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract. In these cases, we account for the additional products or services as a separate contract. In other cases where the pricing in the modification does not reflect the standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract, we account for the additional products or services as part of the existing contract on a prospective basis, on a cumulative catch-up basis, or a combination of both based on the nature of the modification. In instances where the pricing in the modification offers the customer a credit for a prior arrangement, we adjust our variable consideration reserves for returns and other concessions. \n\nRight of return. Certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receive a credit. We estimate returns based on historical returns data which is constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is not probable. We do not recognize revenue for products or services that are expected to be returned. \n\nPractical expedient elected. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. For contracts that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented, we have not retrospectively restated the contract for those modifications. We have disclosed the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations for purposes of determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price at transition. \n\nResearch and development. &#160; Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers and third parties engaged in the design and development of our products, software and technologies, including salary, bonus and stock-based compensation expense, project material costs, services and depreciation. Such costs are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred. \n\nStock-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense for time-based restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) using the straight-line amortization method based on the fair value of RSUs on the date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is the closing market price of Broadcom common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Broadcom common stock prior to vesting. We recognize compensation expense for time-based stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights under the Broadcom Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;) based on the estimated grant-date fair value determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a straight-line amortization method. \n\nCertain equity awards include both service and market conditions. The fair value of market-based awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Compensation expense for market-based awards is amortized based upon a graded vesting method over the service period. \n\nWe estimate forfeitures expected to occur and recognize stock-based compensation expense for such awards expected to vest. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on stock-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. \n\nShipping and handling costs. &#160; Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue and the associated expense is included in cost of revenue for all periods presented. \n\nLitigation and settlement cost. We are involved in legal actions and other matters arising in our recent business acquisitions and in the normal course of business. We recognize an estimated loss contingency when the outcome is probable prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. \n\nIncome taxes. &#160; We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. \n\nWe recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. If we determine that we are able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net carrying values, we adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the provision for income taxes or increase the benefit from income taxes. Likewise, if we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, we increase the provision for income taxes or decrease the benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made. \n\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on income taxes. This guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. \n\nNet income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs, in-the-money stock options, and ESPP rights (together referred to as &#8220;equity awards&#8221;), as well as convertible preferred stock. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share. \n\nThe dilutive effect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and purchasing shares under the ESPP and the amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. The dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock is calculated using the if-converted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities were converted at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance. In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . The new guidance requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as if it had originated the contracts. We early adopted this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2022 and it did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. \n\n3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers \n\nDisaggregation \n\nWe have considered (1) information that is regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (the &#8220;CODM&#8221;) as defined by the authoritative guidance on segment reporting, in evaluating financial performance and (2) disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and subscriptions and services, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, revenues by reportable segment are presented in Note 13. &#8220;Segment Information.&#8221; \n\nThe following tables present revenue disaggregated by type of revenue and by region for the periods presented: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2022 Americas Asia Pacific Europe, the Middle East and Africa Total (In millions) Products $ 2,371 &#160; $ 21,761 &#160; $ 2,145 &#160; $ 26,277 &#160; \n\nSubscriptions and services (a) \n\n4,573 &#160; 744 &#160; 1,609 &#160; 6,926 &#160; Total $ 6,944 &#160; $ 22,505 &#160; $ 3,754 &#160; $ 33,203 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2021 Americas Asia Pacific Europe, the Middle East and Africa Total (In millions) Products $ 1,809 &#160; $ 17,258 &#160; $ 1,819 &#160; $ 20,886 &#160; \n\nSubscriptions and services (a) \n\n4,290 &#160; 720 &#160; 1,554 &#160; 6,564 &#160; Total $ 6,099 &#160; $ 17,978 &#160; $ 3,373 &#160; $ 27,450 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2020 Americas Asia Pacific Europe, the Middle East and Africa Total (In millions) Products $ 1,775 &#160; $ 14,442 &#160; $ 1,218 &#160; $ 17,435 &#160; \n\nSubscriptions and services (a) \n\n4,059 &#160; 881 &#160; 1,513 &#160; 6,453 &#160; Total $ 5,834 &#160; $ 15,323 &#160; $ 2,731 &#160; $ 23,888 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_____________________________ \n\n(a) Subscriptions and services predominantly includes software licenses with termination for convenience clauses. \n\nAlthough we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by region based primarily on the geographic shipment location or delivery location specified by our distributors, original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) customers, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers. \n\nContract Balances \n\nContract assets and contract liabilities balances were as follows: ##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Contract Assets $ 128 &#160; $ 126 &#160; Contract Liabilities $ 3,341 &#160; $ 3,185 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nChanges in our contract assets and contract liabilities primarily result from the timing difference between our performance and the customer&#8217;s payment. We fulfill our obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. We recognize a contract asset when we transfer products or services to a customer and the right to consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Accounts receivable are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. We recognize contract liabilities when we have received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer and we have a future obligation to transfer products or services. Contract liabilities include amounts billed or collected and advanced payments on contracts or arrangements which may include termination for convenience provisions. The amount of revenue recognized during fiscal year 2022 that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of October 31, 2021 was $ 2,615 million. The amount of revenue recognized during fiscal year 2021 that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of November 1, 2020 was $ 2,617 million. \n\nRemaining Performance Obligations \n\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP. \n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $ 23.6 billion. We expect approximately 28 % of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods . \n\n4. Acquisitions \n\nPending Acquisition of VMware, Inc. \n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;VMware Merger Agreement&#8221;) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. (&#8220;VMware&#8221;) in a cash-and-stock transaction (the &#8220;VMware Merger&#8221;) that values VMware at approximately $ 61 billion based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware&#8217;s closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash. \n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $ 142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50 % of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger. \n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts. \n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors. \n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 32 billion. \n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 (&#8220;fiscal year 2023&#8221;), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $ 1.5 billion. \n\nAcquisition of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security Business \n\nOn November 4, 2019 (the &#8220;Symantec Acquisition Date&#8221;), we completed the purchase of the Symantec Business, which was an established leader in cyber security, for $ 10.7 billion in cash. We acquired the Symantec Business to expand our footprint of mission critical infrastructure software with our existing customer base. The Symantec Business includes a deep and broad mix of products, services and solutions, unifying cloud and on-premises security to provide advanced threat protection and information protection across endpoints, network, email and cloud applications. We financed this acquisition with borrowings. \n\nThe following table presents our allocation of the total purchase price: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value (In millions) Current assets $ 273 &#160; Goodwill 6,638 &#160; Intangible assets 5,411 &#160; Other long-term assets 92 &#160; Total assets acquired 12,414 &#160; Current liabilities ( 1,127 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 587 ) Total liabilities assumed ( 1,714 ) Fair value of net assets acquired $ 10,700 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and anticipated synergies and economies of scale expected from the integration of the Symantec Business. The synergies include certain cost savings, operating efficiencies, and other strategic benefits projected to be achieved resulting from the acquisition of the Symantec Business. Substantially all goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. \n\nCurrent assets and current liabilities included amounts held-for-sale related to the acquired Symantec Cyber Security Services business, which was not aligned with our acquisition-date strategic objectives and was sold on April 30, 2020. We do not have any material continuing involvement with this business and have presented its results in discontinued operations. \n\nOur results of continuing operations for fiscal year 2020 included $ 1,610 million of net revenue attributable to the Symantec Business. It was impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the Symantec Business as we had integrated the Symantec Business into our ongoing operations during the year. The results of operations of the Symantec Business were included in our infrastructure software segment. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of the Symantec Business of $ 110 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2020. \n\nIntangible Assets \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Weighted-Average Amortization Periods (In millions) (In years) Developed technology $ 2,900 &#160; 5 Customer contracts and related relationships 2,410 &#160; 5 Trade name 90 &#160; 6 Order backlog 11 &#160; 3 Total identified finite-lived intangible assets $ 5,411 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nDeveloped technology relates to products used for cyber security solutions, including data loss prevention, endpoint protection, and web, email and cloud security solutions. We valued the developed technology using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the developed technology less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period. \n\nCustomer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of products to existing customers of the Symantec Business. Customer contracts and related relationships were valued using the with-and-without-method under the income approach. In the with-and-without method, the fair value was measured by the difference between the present values of the cash flows with and without the existing customers in place over the period of time necessary to reacquire the customers. The economic useful life was determined by evaluating many factors, including the useful life of other intangible assets, the length of time remaining on the acquired contracts and the historical customer turnover rates. \n\nTrade name relates to the &#8220;Symantec&#8221; trade name. The fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the trade name. The economic useful life was determined based on the expected life of the trade name and the cash flows anticipated over the forecast period. \n\nOrder backlog represents business under existing contractual obligations. The fair value of backlog was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach based on expected operating cash flows from future contractual revenue. The economic useful life was determined based on the expected life of the backlog and the cash flows over the forecast period. \n\nWe believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant would pay for, these intangible assets as of the Symantec Acquisition Date. \n\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information \n\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents combined results of operations for the period presented, as if we had completed the acquisition of the Symantec Business as of the beginning of our fiscal year ended November 3, 2019 (&#8220;fiscal year 2019&#8221;). The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments to amortization and depreciation for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired, adjustments to interest expense for the additional indebtedness incurred to complete the acquisition, restructuring charges related to the acquisition and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma information presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the combined business had the acquisition actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 or of the results of our future operations of the combined business. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2020 (In millions) Pro forma net revenue $ 23,264 &#160; Pro forma net income attributable to common stock $ 2,368 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nOther Acquisitions \n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we completed four acquisitions qualifying as business combinations for total consideration of $ 245 million. For these acquisitions, $ 164 million was allocated to goodwill and $ 110 million was allocated to intangible assets, with additional amounts allocated to tangible assets and liabilities, primarily within our infrastructure software segment. \n\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we completed three other acquisitions qualifying as business combinations for total consideration of $ 201 million. For these acquisitions, $ 109 million was allocated to goodwill and $ 46 million was allocated to intangible assets, with additional amounts allocated to tangible assets and liabilities, primarily within our infrastructure software segment. \n\n5. Supplemental Financial Information \n\nCash Equivalents \n\nCash equivalents included $ 3,915 million and $ 4,668 million of time deposits and $ 2,365 million and $ 1,607 million of money-market funds as of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. For time deposits, carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of money-market funds, which was consistent with their carrying value, was determined using unadjusted prices in active, accessible markets for identical assets, and as such, they were classified as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nAccounts Receivable Factoring \n\nWe sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring arrangements. We account for these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided \n\nby operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows . Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring arrangements were $ 3,700 million, $ 4,027 million and $ 3,723 million during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in other income (expense), net and were not material for any of the periods presented. \n\nInventory \n\n##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Finished goods $ 780 &#160; $ 423 &#160; Work-in-process 966 &#160; 680 &#160; Raw materials 179 &#160; 194 &#160; Total inventory $ 1,925 &#160; $ 1,297 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net \n\n##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Land $ 195 &#160; $ 195 &#160; Construction in progress 63 &#160; 38 &#160; Buildings and leasehold improvements 1,156 &#160; 1,150 &#160; Machinery and equipment 4,413 &#160; 4,161 &#160; Total property, plant and equipment 5,827 &#160; 5,544 &#160; Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 3,604 ) ( 3,196 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 2,223 &#160; $ 2,348 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nDepreciation expense was $ 529 million, $ 539 million and $ 570 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nOther Current Assets \n\n##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Prepaid expenses $ 864 &#160; $ 539 &#160; Other 341 &#160; 516 &#160; Total other current assets $ 1,205 &#160; $ 1,055 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nOther Current Liabilities \n\n##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Contract liabilities $ 2,931 &#160; $ 2,619 &#160; Tax liabilities 680 &#160; 541 &#160; Interest payable 393 &#160; 282 &#160; Other 408 &#160; 397 &#160; Total other current liabilities $ 4,412 &#160; $ 3,839 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities \n\n##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties $ 3,229 &#160; $ 3,407 &#160; Contract liabilities 410 &#160; 566 &#160; Other 774 &#160; 887 &#160; Total other long-term liabilities $ 4,413 &#160; $ 4,860 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nOther Income (Expense), Net \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Gain (loss) on investments $ ( 169 ) $ 99 &#160; $ 31 &#160; Other income 30 &#160; 26 &#160; 56 &#160; Interest income 100 &#160; 16 &#160; 53 &#160; Other expense ( 15 ) ( 10 ) ( 50 ) Gain from lapse of indemnification &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 116 &#160; Other income (expense), net $ ( 54 ) $ 131 &#160; $ 206 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nOther income includes foreign exchange gains, dividends, and other miscellaneous items. \n\n6.

Retirement Plans \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans \n\nThe U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of a qualified pension plan. Benefits of the qualified pension plan are provided under an adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance program or a dollar-per-month program. Benefit accruals under this plan were frozen in 2009. Participants in the adjusted career-average-pay program no longer earn service accruals. Participants in the cash-balance program no longer earn service accruals, but continue to earn 4 % interest per year on their cash-balance accounts. There are no active participants under the dollar-per-month program. We also have a non-qualified supplemental pension plan in the United States that principally provides benefits based on compensation in excess of amounts that can be considered under the qualified pension plan. \n\nWe also have defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in Austria, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan and Taiwan. Eligibility is generally determined based on the terms of our plans and local statutory requirements. \n\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Service cost $ 8 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 12 &#160; Interest cost 39 &#160; 39 &#160; 45 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 39 ) ( 40 ) ( 46 ) Other \n\n1 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 3 ) Net periodic benefit cost $ 9 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 8 &#160; Net actuarial (gain) loss $ ( 17 ) $ 8 &#160; $ ( 28 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost are included in other income (expense), net.

Our benefit plan investment committee has set the investment strategy to fully match the liability. We direct the overall portfolio allocation and use a third-party investment consultant that has the discretion to structure portfolios and select the investment managers within those allocation parameters. Multiple investment managers are utilized, including both active and passive management approaches. The plan assets are invested using the liability-driven investment strategy intended to minimize market and interest rate risks, and those assets are periodically rebalanced toward asset allocation targets. \n\nThe target asset allocation for the U.S. qualified pension plan reflects a risk/return profile that we believe is appropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation of plan assets relative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. For both fiscal years 2022 and 2021, 100 % of the U.S. qualified pension plan assets were allocated to fixed income, in line with the target allocation. The fixed income allocation is primarily directed toward long-term core bond investments, with smaller allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and high-yield bonds. \n\nFair Value Measurement of Plan Assets \n\n##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using Level 1 Level 2 Total (In millions) Cash equivalents $ 19 &#160; \n\n(a) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 19 &#160; Equity securities: Non-U.S. equity securities 46 &#160; \n\n(b) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 46 &#160; Fixed-income securities: U.S. treasuries &#8212; &#160; 147 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n147 &#160; Corporate bonds &#8212; &#160; 901 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n901 &#160; Municipal bonds &#8212; &#160; 20 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n20 &#160; Government bonds &#8212; &#160; 25 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n25 &#160; Asset-backed securities &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n2 &#160; Total plan assets $ 65 &#160; $ 1,095 &#160; $ 1,160 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START October 31, 2021 Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using Level 1 Level 2 Total (In millions) Cash equivalents $ 24 &#160; \n\n(a) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 24 &#160; Equity securities: Non-U.S. equity securities 28 &#160; \n\n(b) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 28 &#160; Fixed-income securities: U.S. treasuries &#8212; &#160; 186 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n186 &#160; Corporate bonds &#8212; &#160; 1,222 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n1,222 &#160; Municipal bonds &#8212; &#160; 24 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n24 &#160; Government bonds &#8212; &#160; 34 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n34 &#160; Asset-backed securities &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; \n\n(c) \n\n3 &#160; Total plan assets $ 52 &#160; $ 1,469 &#160; $ 1,521 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n______________________________ \n\n(a) Cash equivalents primarily included short-term investment funds which consisted of short-term money market instruments that were valued based on quoted prices in active markets. \n\n(b) These equity securities were valued based on quoted prices in active markets. \n\n(c) These amounts consisted of investments that were traded less frequently than Level 1 securities and were valued using inputs that included quoted prices for similar assets in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that were observable for the assets, such as interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, collateral performance, broker/dealer quotes and indices that were observable at commonly quoted intervals. \n\nAssumptions &#160; \n\nThe assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans are presented in the table below. The expected long-term return on assets shown in the table below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios primarily consisting of combinations of debt, equity and other investments, depending on the plan. The long-term rates of return are then weighted based on the asset classes in which the pension funds are invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which defined benefit pension obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans, which is October 31, the month end closest to our fiscal year end. The range of assumptions reflects the different economic environments within various countries. \n\n##TABLE_START Assumptions for Benefit Obligations as of Assumptions for Net Periodic Benefit Cost Fiscal Year October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 1.25 %- 7.25 % \n\n0.75 %- 6.50 % \n\n0.75 %- 6.50 % \n\n0.61 %- 6.54 % \n\n0.47 %- 7.00 % \n\nAverage increase in compensation levels \n\n2.00 %- 10.00 % \n\n2.00 %- 10.00 % \n\n2.00 %- 10.00 % \n\n2.00 %- 10.00 % \n\n2.00 %- 10.00 % \n\nExpected long-term return on assets \n\nN/A N/A 1.50 %- 7.25 % \n\n1.00 %- 8.00 % \n\n1.50 %- 7.80 % \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nDefined Contribution Plans \n\nOur eligible U.S. employees participate in a company-sponsored 401(k) plan.

At any time prior to September 30, 2022, holders could elect to convert each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at the then minimum conversion rate. The conversion rates were subject to anti-dilution adjustments. \n\nThe holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, out of funds legally available for payment, cumulative dividends at the annual rate of 8.00 % of the liquidation preference of $ 1,000 per share (equivalent to $ 80 annually per share), payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of shares of our common stock or any combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election; provided, however, that any undeclared and unpaid dividends will continue to accumulate. \n\nSubject to limited exceptions, no dividends may be declared or paid on shares of our common stock, unless all accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding shares of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for all past completed dividend periods. In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock a liquidation preference equal to $ 1,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. \n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, outstanding shares of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock converted into an aggregate of approximately 12 million shares of our common stock at conversion rates ranging between 3.0894 and 3.1149 common shares per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.

The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated at any time. \n\nEquity Incentive Award Plan \n\n2012 Plan \n\nIn connection with the acquisition of BRCM, we assumed the BRCM 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#8220;Original 2012 Plan&#8221;) and outstanding unvested RSUs originally granted by BRCM under the Original 2012 Plan that were held by continuing employees.

Under the Amended 2012 Plan, we may grant to employees stock options and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair market value on the date of grant, restricted stock awards and RSUs. No participant may be granted such awards for more than an aggregate of 4 million shares in any fiscal year. Equity awards granted under the Amended 2012 Plan generally vest over four years . The Amended 2012 Plan reduced the number of shares available for new equity award grants to 20 million shares and removed the annual share replenishment provision provided under the Original 2012 Plan. Awards cancelled or forfeited and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations become available for future issuance. As of October 30, 2022, 21 million shares remained available for issuance under the Amended 2012 Plan. \n\nWe may grant market-based RSUs with both a service condition and a market condition as part of our equity compensation programs. The market-based RSUs generally vest over four years , subject to satisfaction of market conditions. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we granted market-based RSUs under which grantees may receive the number of shares ranging from 0 % to 300 % of the original grant at vesting based upon the total stockholder return (&#8220;TSR&#8221;) on our common stock on an absolute basis and as compared to the TSR of an index group of companies. \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan \n\nThe ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in us through periodic payroll deductions, based on a 6 -month look-back period, at a price equal to the lesser of 85 % of the fair market value of our common stock at either the beginning or the end of the relevant offering period. The ESPP is structured as a qualified employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. However, the ESPP is not intended to be a qualified pension, profit sharing or stock bonus plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. \n\nStock-Based Compensation Expense \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Cost of products sold $ 65 &#160; $ 78 &#160; $ 109 &#160; Cost of subscriptions and services 82 &#160; 65 &#160; 50 &#160; Research and development 1,048 &#160; 1,199 &#160; 1,419 &#160; Selling, general and administrative 338 &#160; 362 &#160; 398 &#160; Total stock-based compensation expense $ 1,533 &#160; $ 1,704 &#160; $ 1,976 &#160; Estimated income tax benefits for stock-based compensation $ 255 &#160; $ 283 &#160; $ 345 &#160; Excess income tax benefits for stock-based awards exercised or released $ 375 &#160; $ 310 &#160; $ 147 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nWe have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate for RSUs of 5 %. We will recognize additional expense if actual forfeitures are lower than we estimated, and will recognize a benefit if actual forfeitures are higher than we estimated. \n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a broad-based program of multi-year equity grants of time- and market-based RSUs (the &#8220;Multi-Year Equity Awards&#8221;) in lieu of our annual employee equity awards historically granted on March 15 of each year. Each Multi-Year Equity Award vests on the same basis as four annual grants made March 15 of each year, beginning in fiscal year 2019, with successive four-year vesting periods. Stock-based compensation expense related to the Multi-Year Equity Awards was $ 794 million, $ 816 million and $ 902 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nAs of October 30, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards was $ 2,704 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average service period of 2.7 years. \n\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions utilized to calculate the fair value of market-based awards granted in the periods presented: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate 1.4 &#160; % 0.3 &#160; % 1.2 &#160; % Dividend yield 2.7 &#160; % 3.0 &#160; % 4.7 &#160; % Volatility 37.1 &#160; % 39.0 &#160; % 31.2 &#160; % Expected term (in years) 3.4 3.4 4.0 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe risk-free interest rate was derived from the average U.S. Treasury Strips rate, which approximated the rate in effect appropriate for the term at the time of grant. \n\nThe dividend yield was based on the historical and expected dividend payouts as of the respective award grant dates. \n\nThe volatility was based on our own historical stock price volatility over the period commensurate with the expected life of the awards and the implied volatility of a 180-day call option on our own common stock measured at a specific date. \n\nThe expected term was commensurate with the awards&#8217; contractual terms. \n\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards \n\nA summary of time- and market-based RSU activity is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of RSUs Outstanding Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share (In millions, except per share data) Balance as of November 3, 2019 40 &#160; $ 188.52 &#160; Granted 3 &#160; $ 252.36 &#160; Vested ( 8 ) $ 210.84 &#160; Forfeited ( 3 ) $ 198.17 &#160; Balance as of November 1, 2020 32 &#160; $ 188.35 &#160; Granted 2 &#160; $ 408.69 &#160; Vested ( 8 ) $ 214.15 &#160; Forfeited ( 3 ) $ 189.84 &#160; Balance as of October 31, 2021 23 &#160; $ 200.38 &#160; Granted 3 &#160; $ 527.69 &#160; Vested ( 7 ) $ 225.52 &#160; Forfeited ( 1 ) $ 242.82 &#160; Balance as of October 30, 2022 18 &#160; $ 238.49 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe aggregate fair value of time- and market-based RSUs that vested in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 4,207 million, $ 3,715 million, and $ 2,254 million, respectively, which represented the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The number of RSUs vested included shares of common stock that we withheld for settlement of employees&#8217; tax obligations due upon the vesting of RSUs. \n\nStock Option Awards \n\nAs of October 30, 2022, our stock options outstanding were not material. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 3 million, $ 339 million, and $ 917 million, respectively. \n\n12. Income Taxes \n\nThe components of income from continuing operations before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Domestic loss $ ( 2,020 ) $ ( 3,103 ) $ ( 4,221 ) Foreign income 14,454 &#160; 9,868 &#160; 6,664 &#160; Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 12,434 &#160; $ 6,765 &#160; $ 2,443 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe components of the provision for and benefit from income taxes were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Current tax expense: &#160; &#160; &#160; Federal $ 174 &#160; $ 446 &#160; $ 7 &#160; State 48 &#160; 46 &#160; 51 &#160; Foreign 762 &#160; 534 &#160; 506 &#160; Total 984 &#160; 1,026 &#160; 564 &#160; Deferred tax expense (benefit from): &#160; &#160; &#160; Federal 68 &#160; ( 876 ) ( 627 ) State ( 15 ) ( 114 ) ( 161 ) Foreign ( 98 ) ( 7 ) ( 294 ) Total ( 45 ) ( 997 ) ( 1,082 ) Total provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 939 &#160; $ 29 &#160; $ ( 518 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the statutory federal tax rate: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 Statutory tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % State, net of federal benefit 0.2 &#160; ( 0.8 ) ( 3.6 ) Foreign income taxed at different rates ( 19.1 ) ( 22.8 ) ( 48.6 ) Deemed inclusion of foreign earnings 9.4 &#160; 12.7 &#160; 23.3 &#160; Foreign-derived intangible income deduction &#8212; &#160; ( 3.1 ) ( 1.5 ) Deferred taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 0.1 &#160; ( 0.7 ) ( 1.1 ) Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ( 3.0 ) ( 4.6 ) ( 6.0 ) Research and development credit ( 1.4 ) ( 2.3 ) ( 4.3 ) Other, net 0.3 &#160; 1.0 &#160; ( 0.4 ) Effective tax rate on income before income taxes 7.5 &#160; % 0.4 &#160; % ( 21.2 ) % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations. \n\nThe provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2021 compared to the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations, offset in part by higher excess tax benefits from stock-based awards. The benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to jurisdictional mix of income and expenses, discrete benefits from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in a foreign jurisdiction, and excess tax benefits from stock-based awards. \n\nOur tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax incentives are expected to expire in November 2025. \n\nWe have also obtained a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028. The tax holiday that we negotiated in Malaysia is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with any such conditions specified, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. \n\nBefore taking into consideration the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to decrease the provision for income taxes by approximately $ 1,821 million and $ 1,156 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, and increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately $ 833 million for fiscal year 2020. \n\nSignificant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Deferred income tax assets: &#160; &#160; Net operating loss, credit and other carryforwards $ 1,808 &#160; $ 1,774 &#160; Deferred revenue 645 &#160; 1,332 &#160; Employee stock awards 183 &#160; 192 &#160; Other deferred income tax assets 499 &#160; 446 &#160; Gross deferred income tax assets 3,135 &#160; 3,744 &#160; Less: valuation allowance ( 1,777 ) ( 1,782 ) Deferred income tax assets 1,358 &#160; 1,962 &#160; Deferred income tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization 341 &#160; 847 &#160; Unamortized discount and issuance costs 322 &#160; 374 &#160; Foreign earnings not indefinitely reinvested 86 &#160; 73 &#160; Other deferred income tax liabilities 36 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Deferred income tax liabilities 785 &#160; 1,294 &#160; Net deferred income tax assets $ 573 &#160; $ 668 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nWe continue to indefinitely reinvest $ 2,112 million of certain accumulated foreign earnings. The unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is estimated to be $ 222 million. All other current and future earnings of all our foreign subsidiaries are not considered permanently reinvested. \n\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had tax effected U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 200 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 190 million, all of which expire in various years beginning fiscal year 2023. We had $ 1,334 million of state research and development tax credits which begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. We have provided a valuation allowance on substantially all state tax credits and state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as we do not expect them to be realized. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 5,030 &#160; $ 4,748 &#160; $ 4,422 &#160; Lapses of statutes of limitations ( 50 ) ( 58 ) ( 95 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods (including those related to acquisitions made during the year) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 41 &#160; 98 &#160; Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods ( 113 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 14 ) Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period \n\n288 &#160; 337 &#160; 379 &#160; Decreases in balances related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 38 ) ( 38 ) ( 42 ) Ending balance $ 5,117 &#160; $ 5,030 &#160; $ 4,748 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties were included within other long-term liabilities. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we recognized interest and penalties of $ 25 million and $ 46 million, respectively, within the provision for income taxes. During fiscal year 2020, we recognized interest and penalties of $ 37 million within the benefit from income taxes. As of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, the combined amount of cumulative accrued interest and penalties was approximately $ 411 million and $ 386 million, respectively. \n\nAs of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021, approximately $ 5,528 million and $ 5,416 million, respectively, of the unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties would, if recognized, benefit our effective income tax rate. We are subject to U.S. income tax examination for fiscal years 2015 and later. Certain of our acquired companies are subject to tax examinations in major jurisdictions outside of the U.S. for fiscal years 2008 and later. It is possible that our existing unrecognized tax benefits may change up to $ 163 million as a result of lapses of the statute of limitations for certain audit periods and/or audit examinations expected to be completed within the next 12 months. \n\n13. Segment Information \n\nReportable Segments \n\nWe have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Each segment has separate financial information that is utilized on a regular basis by the CODM in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. The reportable segments are determined based on several factors including, but not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products, technology, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics. \n\nSemiconductor solutions . We provide semiconductor solutions for managing the movement of data in data center, service provider, enterprise and embedded networking applications. We provide a broad variety of radio frequency semiconductor devices, wireless connectivity solutions, custom touch controllers, and inductive charging solutions for mobile applications. We also provide semiconductor solutions for enabling the set-top box and broadband access markets and for enabling secure movement of digital data to and from host machines, such as servers, personal computers and storage systems, to the underlying storage devices, such as hard disk drives and solid state drives. We also provide a broad variety of products for the general industrial and automotive markets. Our semiconductor solutions segment also includes our IP licensing. \n\nInfrastructure software. We provide a portfolio of software solutions that enables customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security. We also offer mission critical FC SAN products and related software. \n\nOur CODM assesses the performance of each segment and allocates resources to each segment based on net revenue and operating results and does not evaluate each segment using discrete asset information. Operating results by segment include items that are directly attributable to each segment and also include shared expenses such as marketing, general and administrative activities, facilities and information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) expenses. Shared expenses are primarily allocated based on revenue, headcount or evenly between the segments. \n\nUnallocated Expenses \n\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, and other costs, which are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Acquisition-related costs include transaction costs and any costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses. \n\nDepreciation expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There was no inter-segment revenue for any of the periods presented. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Net revenue: Semiconductor solutions $ 25,818 &#160; $ 20,383 &#160; $ 17,267 &#160; Infrastructure software 7,385 &#160; 7,067 &#160; 6,621 &#160; Total net revenue $ 33,203 &#160; $ 27,450 &#160; $ 23,888 &#160; Operating income: Semiconductor solutions $ 15,075 &#160; $ 10,976 &#160; $ 8,576 &#160; Infrastructure software 5,219 &#160; 4,936 &#160; 4,363 &#160; Unallocated expenses ( 6,069 ) ( 7,393 ) ( 8,925 ) Total operating income $ 14,225 &#160; $ 8,519 &#160; $ 4,014 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nGeographic Information \n\nNet revenue by country is based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location as specified by the distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers who purchased our products or services. For the majority of our products, title and control transfer to our customers in Penang, Malaysia. The products are then transported to the customer specific locations. Net revenue from the United States for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 5,915 million, $ 5,285 million and $ 4,778 million, respectively. Net revenue from China (including Hong Kong) for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 11,637 million, $ 9,752 million and $ 7,808 million, respectively. Net revenue from Singapore for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was $ 4,003 million and $ 2,754 million, respectively (the amount was less than 10% for fiscal year 2020). Net revenue from other foreign countries for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 11,648 million, $ 9,659 million and $ 11,302 million, respectively. These geographic delivery locations are not necessarily indicative of the geographic location of our end customers or the country in which our end customers sell devices containing our products. For example, we believe a substantial portion of our products shipped or delivered to China (including Hong Kong) is included in devices sold by our end customers in the United States and Europe. \n\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and are based on the physical location of the assets. \n\n##TABLE_START October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 (In millions) Long-lived assets: United States $ 1,441 &#160; $ 1,540 &#160; Taiwan 318 &#160; 313 &#160; Other 464 &#160; 495 &#160; Total long-lived assets $ 2,223 &#160; $ 2,348 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nSignificant Customer Information \n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. Two customers accounted for 15 % and 11 % of our net accounts receivable balance as of October 30, 2022. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our net accounts receivable balance as of October 31, 2021. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, one customer accounted for 20 %, 18 % and 13 % of our net revenue, respectively. Revenue from this customer was included in our semiconductor solutions segment. \n\n14. Commitments and Contingencies \n\nCommitments \n\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of October 30, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year: Purchase Commitments Other Contractual Commitments (In millions) 2023 $ 199 &#160; $ 304 &#160; 2024 211 &#160; 261 &#160; 2025 90 &#160; 147 &#160; 2026 11 &#160; 162 &#160; 2027 7 &#160; 112 &#160; Thereafter 7 &#160; 447 &#160; Total $ 525 &#160; $ 1,433 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPurchase Commitments. Represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. \n\nOther Contractual Commitments. Represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to IT, human resources, and other service agreements. \n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at October 30, 2022, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $ 3,229 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties classified within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of October 30, 2022 have been excluded from the table above. \n\nContingencies \n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies engaged in our lines of business, including commercial disputes, employment issues, tax disputes and disputes involving claims by third parties that our activities infringe their patent, copyright, trademark or other IP rights, as well as regulatory investigations or inquiries. Legal proceedings and regulatory investigations or inquiries are often complex, may require the expenditure of significant funds and other resources, and the outcome of such proceedings is inherently uncertain, with material adverse outcomes possible. IP property claims generally involve the demand by a third-party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay substantial damages or royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing IP. Claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate any third-party IP rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers) often involve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Moreover, from time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights. Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex IP litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. \n\nLawsuits Relating to California Institute of Technology \n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (\"Caltech\") filed a complaint against Broadcom and Apple Inc. on May 26, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the &#8220;U.S. Central District Court&#8221;), and an amended complaint adding Cypress Semiconductor Corporation as a defendant on August 15, 2016. The amended complaint alleged that chips that support certain error correction codes as specified in IEEE Standards 802.11n and 802.11ac willfully infringed four patents related to error correction coding: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,916,781; and 8,284,833 (&#8220;&#8217;833 patent&#8221;). Prior to trial, Caltech dismissed its claims against Cypress and withdrew its infringement allegations as to &#8216;833 patent. The complaint sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as attorneys&#8217; fees, costs, and expenses. The trial was held in January 2020, and on January 29, 2020, the jury issued its verdict finding infringement and awarding Caltech past damages of $ 270.2 million from Broadcom and $ 837.8 million from Apple, for which Apple is seeking indemnification from Broadcom. On August 3, 2020, the U.S. Central District Court issued its judgment, awarding Caltech past damages in the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest. Additionally, the U.S. Central District Court awarded Caltech an unspecified amount of ongoing royalties to be determined after the anticipated appeals process is resolved. Neither the jury nor the U.S. Central District Court found willful infringement, which if it had, could have resulted in enhanced damages up to three times the amount awarded. Broadcom and Apple appealed to the United States Court of \n\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit (the &#8220;Federal Circuit Court&#8221;). In February 2022, the Federal Circuit Court affirmed infringement of two patents, both of which expired in August 2020, but it did not address all issues and ordered a new trial on damages and on the infringement of the 7,916,781 patent, which also expired in August 2020. In May 2022, the Federal Circuit Court denied the petition for rehearing filed by Broadcom and Apple, and remanded the case to the U.S. Central District Court. Subsequently, Caltech withdrew its infringement allegations as to the 7,916,781 patent. \n\nWe believe that the evidence and the law do not support the U.S. Central District Court&#8217;s findings of infringement. We cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome as the Federal Circuit Court vacated the above damages, and a number of factors (including a retrial at the lower court and further appeals) could significantly change the assessment of damages. As a result, we have not recorded a reserve with respect to this litigation, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. \n\nOther Matters \n\nIn addition to the matters discussed above, we are currently engaged in a number of legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. \n\nContingency Assessment \n\nWe do not believe, based on currently available facts and circumstances, that the final outcome of any pending legal proceedings or ongoing regulatory investigations, taken individually or as a whole, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, lawsuits may involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and other resources to defend. The results of litigation or regulatory investigations are inherently uncertain, and material adverse outcomes are possible. From time to time, we may enter into confidential discussions regarding the potential settlement of such lawsuits. Any settlement of pending litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and other ongoing expenses, such as future royalty payments in the case of an IP dispute. \n\nDuring the periods presented, no material amounts have been accrued or disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to loss contingencies associated with any other legal proceedings or regulatory investigations, as potential losses for such matters are not considered probable and ranges of losses are not reasonably estimable. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate outcomes are not predictable. There can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy any liabilities arising from the matters described above will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nOther Indemnifications \n\nAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for IP claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liabilities or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material. \n\n15. Restructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges \n\nRestructuring Charges \n\nFrom time to time, we initiate cost reduction activities to integrate acquired businesses, to align our workforce with strategic business activities, or to improve efficiencies in our operations.

      "text": " ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 30, 2022. The term &#8220;disclosure controls and procedures,&#8221; as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 30, 2022, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: \n\n&#8226; pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets; \n\n&#8226; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of us are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and \n\n&#8226; provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 30, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of October 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. \n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of October 30, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nNo change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fourth quarter ended October 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Although we have modified our workplace practices globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in some of our employees working remotely, this has not meaningfully affected our internal controls over financial reporting. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. \n\n"
