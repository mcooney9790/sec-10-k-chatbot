Business \n\n&#8203; \n\nGENERAL INFORMATION \n\n&#8203; \n\nUnless otherwise indicated, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and similar terms, as well as references to the &#8220;Company,&#8221; refer to O&#8217;Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its Subsidiaries. O&#8217;Reilly is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), selling our products to both do-it-yourself (&#8220;DIY&#8221;) and professional service provider customers, our &#8220;dual market strategy.&#8221; The business was founded in 1957 by Charles F. O&#8217;Reilly and his son, Charles H. &#8220;Chub&#8217;&#8217; O&#8217;Reilly, Sr., and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri. Our common stock has traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;ORLY&#8221; since April 22, 1993.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we operated 5,929 stores in 47 states in the United States and 42 stores in Mexico. Our stores carry an extensive product line, including\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; new and remanufactured automotive hard parts and maintenance items, such as alternators, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts, fuel pumps, hoses, starters, temperature control, water pumps, antifreeze, appearance products, engine additives, filters, fluids, lighting, oil and wiper blades; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers and truck accessories. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nOur stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers, such as\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; battery diagnostic testing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; check engine light code extraction, where allowed by law; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; custom hydraulic hoses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; drum and rotor resurfacing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; electrical and module testing; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; loaner tool program; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; used oil, oil filter and battery recycling. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nSee the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks relevant to our business. These risk factors include, among others, risks related to deteriorating economic conditions, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products, business interruptions, failure to protect our brand and reputation, risks associated with international operations, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our increased debt levels, a downgrade in our credit ratings, future growth assurance, our dependence upon key personnel, our acquisition strategies, information and systems security, damage and failure, and litigation, environmental legislation and other regulations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOUR BUSINESS \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy. We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O&#8217;Reilly values, including hard work, superior customer service and expense control. Our mission is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCompetitive Advantages \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network and experienced management Team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nProven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy: \n\nFor more than 40 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers. We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage. The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers, capitalizing on our existing store and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIn 2022, we derived approximately 56% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 44% of our sales from our professional service provider customers. Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation. We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge, industry-leading parts availability and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, augmented by our approximately 725 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer. We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.\n\n&#8203; \n\nSuperior Customer Service: \n\nWe seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products. We believe the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the correct automotive products needed to complete their repairs. Accordingly, each O&#8217;Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications. We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management&#8217;s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace. We have no material backorders for the products we sell.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; superior in-store service through highly-motivated, technically-proficient store personnel (&#8220;Professional Parts People&#8221;); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; an extensive selection and superior availability of products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; many enhanced service programs, including battery and electrical testing, battery, wiper and bulb replacement and check engine light code extractions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; attractive stores in convenient locations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; competitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers&#8217; quality and value preferences; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a robust point-of-sale system integrated with our proprietary electronic catalog, which contains a wide variety of product images, schematics and technical specifications and equips our Team Members with highly effective tools to source products in our extensive supply network; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; online ordering for our professional customers through our proprietary professional customer platform, www.FirstCallOnline.com , with local delivery available; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; online ordering, featuring &#8220;chat with a parts professional,&#8221; parts look up assistance for our DIY customers through our retail platform, www.OReillyAuto.com , with convenient store locations for pick up in store orders or home delivery. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nTechnically Proficient Professional Parts People: \n\nOur highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard part repairs, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis. Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People. See our &#8220;Team Members and Human Capital Management&#8221; disclosure of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our technically proficient professional parts people.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nStrategic Regional Tiered Distribution Network: \n\nWe believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network. Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes distribution centers (&#8220;DCs&#8221;) and Hub stores. Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management. We currently operate 28 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 154,000 stock keeping units (&#8220;SKUs&#8221;), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers. To augment our robust distribution network, we operate a total of 383 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to stores within the surrounding areas to an average of 49,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 94,000 SKUs. More than 95% of our stores receive multiple same-day deliveries and deliveries on weekends of hard to find parts from our DCs and Hub stores. We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business. \n\n&#8203; \n\nExperienced Management Team: \n\nOur Company philosophy is to &#8220;promote from within,&#8221; and the vast majority of our senior managers, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company. We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, technical proficiency or subject matter expertise. We have a strong management Team that has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 30 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993. See our &#8220;Team Members and Human Capital Management&#8221; disclosure of the &#8220;Business&#8221; section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our experienced management Team.\n\n&#8203; \n\nGrowth Strategy \n\n&#8203; \n\nAggressively Open New Stores: \n\nWe intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket. During 2022, we opened 170 net, new domestic stores and 17 new stores in Mexico. In 2023, we plan to open 180 to 190 net, new stores, which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets. The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O&#8217;Reilly stores. We typically open new stores by\n\n##TABLE_START (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store (&#8220;jobber store&#8221;), typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (iii) purchasing multi-store chains. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nNew store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, vehicles in operation, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network. While we have, and continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets. We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.\n\n&#8203; \n\nGrow Sales in Existing Stores: \n\nProfitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O&#8217;Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service, that generates sustainable increased sales and profitability.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nSelectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: \n\nThe automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, like O&#8217;Reilly, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation. Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new domestic and international markets.\n\n&#8203; \n\nContinually Enhance Store Design and Location: \n\nOur current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, in-store signage, multilingual signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress, ample parking and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service. We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance. During 2022, while experiencing macroeconomic constraints to construction timing and the supply of material and equipment, we relocated 11 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 1,300 additional stores. We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best attract and serve our customers. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOmnichannel Growth Strategy: \n\nOur Omnichannel growth strategies reflect the continued evolution of customer preferences in researching and completing purchases. More than ever before, our customers&#8217; purchase decisions are informed by a range of interactions, whether in-person, over the phone, or through a variety of digital channels, as they seek to find the professional parts knowledge and the product availability they need to meet their automotive repair and maintenance needs. Our Omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering our customers an enhanced and seamless research and buying experience through any of these channels. We have long been known for excellent customer service and continue to grow the functionality and user-friendliness of our digital platforms, including www.OReillyAuto.com and www.FirstCallOnline.com , to enhance our customers&#8217; shopping experience. Many of our customers interact over multiple channels to research and complete a purchase, and the functionality and features of our digital sites complement the outstanding customer service provided in our brick and mortar locations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nTeam Members and Human Capital Management \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur tradition for 66 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our &#8220;Live Green&#8221; culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member&#8217;s contribution to the success of O&#8217;Reilly. This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading Team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent. \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe are committed to providing a work environment that allows Team Members to feel highly valued and to be productive and effective in their jobs by maintaining an inclusive environment and healthy work/life balance, which we believe increases employee engagement. Our ongoing emphasis on diversity and inclusion, including our policies, recruitment and selection procedures, onboarding processes and training efforts, positively builds upon our successful &#8220;promote from within&#8221; philosophy and growth strategies. \n\n&#8203; \n\nTalent Acquisition, Retention and Training: \n\nOur Company knows the value of a tenured Team, which is why our philosophy is to &#8220;promote from within&#8221; first. As management opportunities arise, we look first within the Company and promote those who have performed well, have the right expertise and have shown leadership potential before looking outside the Company; however, we augment this philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, customer service excellence, subject matter expertise, and strong culture fit. This comprehensive approach increases Team Member commitment and has resulted in a very experienced leadership Team. As of December 31, 2022, our strong management Team was comprised of 226 senior managers who average 20 years of service, 293 corporate managers who average 16 years of service and 591 district managers who average 14 years of service.\n\n&#8203; \n\nEach of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store. Each of our 591 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores, which provides our stores with strong operational support.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe offer a variety of specific training programs that address a broad spectrum of topics from store and distribution center operations to customer service. We believe our highly trained Team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers. A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products. In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard \n\n&#8203; \n\nparts. The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts and repairs or automotive aptitude. New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific position. Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers. Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O&#8217;Reilly Certified Parts Professional test. Passing the O&#8217;Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (&#8220;ASE&#8221;).\n\n&#8203; \n\nAll of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers. For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager. These Team Members then spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers. Each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAdditionally, store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model. Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri. Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training programs, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual leadership conference.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDiversity and Inclusion: \n\nAt O&#8217;Reilly, valuing diversity and inclusion is about creating an environment in which our Team Members feel included, respected and have opportunities to do their best work and achieve their greatest potential. We believe diversity within the workplace is crucial in running our business and building the best Team of Professional Parts People to serve our customers. We are committed to recruiting and building a diverse team through inclusive talent acquisition, ongoing leadership development and actively identifying emerging talent. We have worked to expand opportunities for all of our Team Members through programs designed to prepare them to take on more responsibilities at every level of the organization. We firmly believe that promoting from within is a differentiator in maximizing our diversity across the entire company. In order to ensure our diversity and inclusion efforts are successful, we survey our Team Members, provide enhanced, collaborative learning through diversity and inclusion training and resources, and build network groups, action plans and programs aimed at improving our work environments for our Team Members and customers.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCompensation, Benefits and Recognition: \n\nOur compensation philosophy has always been to incentivize Team Members to &#8220;run it like you own it,&#8221; and we continually evaluate and benchmark our comprehensive compensation programs to ensure they remain competitive, providing an important tool to attract and retain the best and most qualified Team Members in every market. We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through various incentive compensation programs. Store team members have the opportunity to earn incentive pay that increases their base hourly wage consistent with their individual performance or the performance of their store. Store managers, district managers, region directors and division vice presidents have the ability to earn additional compensation above their salary or base hourly wage based upon the performance of their stores. In addition, beginning with the district manager level, we augment our competitive programs with share-based compensation. We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our Team Members.\n\n&#8203; \n\nJust as pay, benefits, and growth opportunities are critically important to our Team Members&#8217; success, we believe it is equally important to recognize Team Members for a job well done. We regularly present many awards that range from recognizing individual service longevity to performance, allowing peer-to-peer recognition or management nomination of an individual&#8217;s excellent performance. \n\n&#8203; \n\nTeam Composition: \n\nWe recognize that each and every one of our Team Members plays a very important role in our ability to provide outstanding customer service and achieve consistent, successful performance. As of January 31, 2023, we employed 87,745 Team Members (71,612 full-time Team Members and 16,133 part-time Team Members), of whom 71,582 were employed at our stores, 11,789 were employed at our DCs and 4,374 were employed at our corporate and regional offices. Ours is an increasingly technical business creating the need for knowledgeable Professional Parts People, and our ongoing focus on developing a technically proficient Team has resulted in the growth of the mix of our full-time work force, increasing from 65% at January 31, 2020 to 82% at January 31, 2023. While full-time Professional Parts People play a vital role in our ongoing success, the flexibility of incorporating part-time employment into our work force is also \n\n&#8203; \n\nan important component of providing excellent customer service. Many of our part-time Team Members choose to work at O&#8217;Reilly while attending school, or during other transitional periods in their lives, or simply because of their passion for cars and knowledge of auto parts. Part-time Team Members have the opportunity to become career Professional Parts People because of our promote from within philosophy, and many of our leaders today began their careers as part-time Team Members in our stores or distribution centers. \n\n&#8203; \n\nA union represents 435 Team Members in 47 stores in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years. There are 52 Team Members that drive over-the-road trucks in two of our domestic DCs that are also represented by a labor union. Additionally, two unions represent approximately 1,076 Team Members in Mexico. We consider our current relationship with these unions and union Team Members to be excellent. With the exception of the previously described Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions. \n\n&#8203; \n\nAdditional information about our Team Member population and human capital management practices can be found in our most recent Sustainability, Social, and Governance report, which is available on our website at www.OReillyAuto.com . Our Sustainability, Social, and Governance report is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n&#8203; \n\nStore Network \n\n&#8203; \n\nNew Store Site Selection: \n\nIn selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; population density; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; demographics, including age, life style and per capita income; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; market economic strength, retail draw and growth patterns; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; number, age and percent of makes and models of registered vehicles; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the number, type and sales potential of existing automotive repair facilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the number of auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; physical location, traffic count, size, economics and presentation of the site; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; financial review of adjacent existing locations; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the type and size of store that should be developed. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nWhen entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale. After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas. As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas. This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.\n\n&#8203; \n\nStore Locations and Size: \n\nAs a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Our U.S. stores, on average, carry approximately 22,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,500 total square feet in size. At December 31, 2022, we had a total of approximately 45 million square feet in our 5,929 domestic stores. Our domestic stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 154,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 383 Hub stores that average 12,700 square feet in size and carry an average of 49,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to an approximately 94,000 SKUs.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe believe that our stores are &#8220;destination stores&#8221; generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity. Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe following table sets forth the geographic distribution and opening activity of our stores as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203;

Our distribution expansion strategy, supported by our ongoing, significant capital investments, complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores, and additional penetration into existing markets, in the regions surrounding each DC. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total growth capacity of 150 to 300 U.S. stores in our distribution network. Further enhancing our distribution capabilities in 2023, we plan to open our first DC in Puerto Rico and a large DC in Guadalajara, Mexico.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDistribution Centers: \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we operated 28 domestic DCs comprised of approximately 12.1 million operating square feet (see the &#8220;Properties&#8221; table in Item 2 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about DC operating square footages). Our DCs stock an average of 154,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have access to multiple other regional DCs&#8217; inventory. Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to substantially all of our stores in the continental United States. In addition, stores within an individual DC&#8217;s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC&#8217;s &#8220;city counter,&#8221; many of which receive this service seven days per week. Our DCs provide service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores. Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAs part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2023, we plan to\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; continue to enhance our distribution network through the engineering, design, expansion or relocation of new or current DCs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; continue to utilize routing software to enhance logistics efficiencies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; continue to implement labor management software to improve DC productivity and overall operating efficiency; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; continue to define and implement best practices in all DCs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules, lift equipment and computer hardware; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; continue to augment our robust distribution network, when and where appropriate, through the use of strategically located Hubs. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nHub Stores: \n\nWe currently operate a total of 383 strategically located Hub stores. In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis. Our Hub store network consists of 383 Hubs that average approximately 12,700 square feet and carry an average of 49,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 94,000 SKUs.\n\n&#8203; \n\nProducts and Purchasing \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks. Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, Castrol, Dorman, Fel-Pro, Gates Rubber, Lucas Oil, Mobil1, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Standard, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better and best value spectrum, under our BesTest&#174;, BrakeBest&#174;, Cartek&#174;, Import Direct&#174;, MasterPro&#174;, MicroGard&#174;, Murray&#174;, Omnispark&#174;, O&#8217;Reilly Auto Parts&#174;, Precision&#174;, Power Torque&#174;, Super Start&#174;, Syntec&#174;, and Ultima&#174; brands. Our proprietary private label products are produced by respected automotive manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands, which we have acquired or developed over time. Our &#8220;good&#8221; proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our &#8220;better&#8221; and &#8220;best&#8221; proprietary brands offer options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts. We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell. It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers. We have entered into various programs \n\n&#8203; \n\nand arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases. As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 815 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24% of our total purchases in 2022. Our largest supplier in 2022 accounted for approximately 7% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 6% of our total purchases.\n\n&#8203; \n\nMarketing \n\n&#8203; \n\nRetail and Online Marketing: \n\nOur integrated marketing strategy and Omnichannel efforts include national media channels, in-store, digital and social media activation, as well as marketing the O&#8217;Reilly brand through automotive event sponsorships and on-site appearances throughout the country. Our O&#8217;Rewards loyalty program encourages repeat customers, as they accumulate points from their O&#8217;Reilly purchases that are redeemable for rewards at various purchase levels. Our marketing efforts also target the Spanish-speaking market through broadcast media, print and sports marketing, as well as sponsorships of local and regional events.\n\n&#8203; \n\nProfessional Marketing: \n\nTo develop our continued relationships with professional service providers and installers, we employ Territory Sales Managers in nearly every market to ensure complete sales territory coverage and personalized service for professional customers. Flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are distributed on a regular basis to all professional service providers, including paint and body shops and fleet maintenance customers to encourage brand and program awareness. In addition, our professional customer program, First Call, also offers a proprietary ordering and other services platform called www.FirstCallOnline.com , dedicated Professional Service Specialists in stores, multiple daily deliveries and access to training opportunities, shop management, maintenance supplies and the Certified Auto Repair program, which offers professional service providers with the business tools they need to profitably grow and market their business. \n\n&#8203; \n\nINDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale. The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $357 billion, according to the Auto Care Association. This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales. We estimate that O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s addressable market within this industry is approximately $130 billion to $140 billion, which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and DIY sales at retail. We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations. \n\n&#8203; \n\nCompetition \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price. We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market. We compete primarily with\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; national retail and wholesale automotive parts chains (such as AutoZone, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST and NAPA); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; regional retail and wholesale automotive parts chains; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; wholesalers or jobber stores (some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA, CARQUEST, Bumper to Bumper and Auto Value); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; automobile dealers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; mass merchandisers and online retailers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.). ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nWe compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout, the Omnichannel experience and convenient and accessible store locations. Our dual market strategy requires significant capital, including the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nInflation and Seasonality \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition costs increased due to price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nTo some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRegulations \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, as well as the health and safety of our Team Members and customers, including, but not limited to, those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants and the ownership and operation of real property.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAs part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our used oil, oil filter and battery recycling programs. We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers. The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into supplier-provided containers and pallets and then recycled by the third-party suppliers. In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCompliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS \n\n&#8203; \n\nGregory D.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY \n\n&#8203; \n\nDeteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others, with which we do business, to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nAlthough demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers. The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels, a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside of our control. Our customers&#8217; purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty. If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nOverall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles in the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the U.S. Changes in vehicle technology used by the original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) on future vehicles, including but not limited to electric, hybrid and internal combustion engines, may result in less frequent repairs, parts lasting longer or elimination of certain repairs. In addition, restrictions on access to telematics, diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the OEMs or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities. Furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may worsen. If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions, the cause of which could include a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nBoth the DIY and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. Online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortment and availability between us and a range of competitors, which could result in pricing pressure. Some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do, as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional in-store experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust, regional distribution footprint, which could also create pricing pressure. We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. For a list of our principal competitors, see the &#8220;Competition&#8221; section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales. \n\nOur business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters. Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers. Extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers&#8217; automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts. In addition, our stores and DCs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased unrecoverable losses resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n&#8203; \n\nA change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, the limited supply or unavailability of key products, supply chain disruptions or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health. \n\nOur business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers&#8217; ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms. For example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them. In addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. We could also be negatively impacted when our suppliers or our supply chain experiences work stoppages; labor strikes; a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic; shipping and transportation disruptions or increased costs; currency fluctuations or inflation; or other interruptions to, or difficulties in, the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase. If we are unable to effectively respond to such disruptions to our supply chain, or manage them more effectively than our competitors, our business and competitive position may be negatively impacted. In addition, changes in U.S. trade policies, sanctions, practices, tariffs or taxes, import limitations and other factors relating to foreign trade and port agreements could affect our ability to source products and our suppliers&#8217; ability to source materials or provide products at current volumes and/or prices. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nBusiness interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, stability of systems we rely on, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business. \n\nBusiness interruptions, including from a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, weather-related events, terrorist activities, war, political or civil unrest, or other disasters, or the threat of them, may result in a disruption of operations or the closure of one or more of our DCs or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis. This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty, among other things. Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices. Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, we rely extensively on various systems, some of which are provided by third-party service providers, to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our stores and customers. These systems are subject to failure, damage or interruption, including power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches or other catastrophic events. If these systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories, deliver product or process customer transactions. Such a disruption of these systems, and the response to remedy, could result in a negative impact on our business operations and increased costs, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nFailure to protect our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nWe believe our Company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry. We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. Our reputation is based, in part, on perceptions of subjective qualities; negative publicity involving the Company, our merchandise or our industry in general that erode customer trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and business. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting or environmental standards, or existing or future laws or regulations, as well as failure or perceived failure to achieve or make progress with environmental, social and governance goals, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions from consumer or environmental groups, employees or regulatory bodies, which could require us to incur substantial legal fees and costs. In addition, negative claims or publicity, including the availability of information and opinions on social media, as its impact is immediate, could adversely affect our reputation. The opportunity for the rapid dissemination of information, including inaccurate and inflammatory information and opinions, is virtually limitless and easily accessible. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRisks associated with international operations could result in additional costs and inefficiencies. \n\nIn addition to many of the risks we face in our U.S. operations, international operations present a unique set of risks and challenges, including local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socio-economic conditions. Our ability to operate effectively and grow in international markets could be impacted by these risks resulting in legal liabilities, additional costs and the distraction of management&#8217;s attention. Compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and protection of intellectual property rights surrounding items such as tradenames and trademarks in foreign jurisdictions can pose significant challenges.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries. Given that our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK \n\n&#8203; \n\nRisks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price. \n\nWe believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. We cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. \n\nThe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions and potentially being targeted through the selling and buying of our common stock by a group of individuals, whose interests \n\n&#8203; \n\nand reasoning behind such actions may not align with an average market participant. The market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts&#8217; expectations and failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#8217;s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such companies. If similar litigation were initiated against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. \n\nWe have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences for our financial health. For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things,\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the senior unsecured notes and our credit facility; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms, if at all; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; expose us to fluctuations in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIn addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees. A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nA downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes, as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs. \n\nCredit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital. These ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength. Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates. A downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility. A downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our unsecured senior notes, preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future. In addition, a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to the supplier financing programs our suppliers participate in at attractive rates. Decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRISK RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY \n\n&#8203; \n\nDamage, failure or interruptions of information technology systems could adversely affect our business operations and results. \n\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to collect, analyze, process, store, manage, transmit and protect business operations, processes, transactions and data. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading or patching of these systems, applications or processes could adversely impact their effectiveness or could expose us to risks. Our systems, and the third-party systems with which we interact, are subject to damage, failure or interruption due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, power or other critical infrastructure outages; facility damage; physical theft; telecommunications failures; malware; security incidents; cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, spyware, denial of service attacks and ransomware; natural disasters and catastrophic events; inadequate or ineffective redundancy measures; and design or usage errors by Team Members, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we seek to effectively \n\n&#8203; \n\nmaintain and safeguard our systems, and we seek to ensure our third-party service providers effectively maintain and safeguard their systems, such measures are not guaranteed to be successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience one or more errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service impacting the integrity or availability of our information technology infrastructure. A material incident could significantly disrupt our operations and business processes; result in the impairment or loss of critical data; be costly and resource-intensive to remedy; and/or harm our reputation and relationship with customers, Team Members, suppliers and other stakeholders, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel require substantial investments, such as replacing systems, maintaining or enhancing systems or designing or acquiring new systems. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, incurring more costs than expected or implementation delays or errors, and may result in operational challenges, security control failures, reputational harm, and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nA breach of customer, supplier, Team Member or Company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or litigation. \n\nOur business involves the receiving, storage and transmitting of certain personally identifiable or confidential information about our customers, suppliers, Team Members and the Company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and suppliers. We and our third-party service providers and suppliers have taken significant and appropriate steps to protect this information, including maintaining compliance with payment card industry and National Clearing House standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies, employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our systems. However, these security measures are costly and require constant, ongoing attention and may not prevent a security breach due to cyber-attacks, computer malware viruses, exploitation of hardware or software vulnerabilities, Team Member error, malfeasance, system compromises, fraud, hacking, trickery or other intentional or unintentional acts, which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. There is no guarantee that the security measures that we and our third-party service providers and suppliers have implemented, or will introduce in the future, to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, or provide us with sufficient visibility to determine if a data security breaches has occurred. A compromise of our security measures or those of a third-party party we entrust could result in information related to our customers, suppliers, Team Members or the Company being obtained or misused by unauthorized persons; damage to our reputation; adverse operational effects or interruptions; costs to the Company to address the breach, which could require extensive time and financial resources to resolve; or claims, litigation or possible regulatory action against us, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, the regulatory environment related to information security and data collection, processing, use and privacy is complex and constantly evolving. The effects of complying with stricter and more complex data collection, processing, use and privacy and information security laws, regulations and standards can be far-reaching and may increase our responsibility and liability, which may increase our costs by needing to invest significant, additional time and resources and make changes to our existing practice and processes. Failure to comply with data collection, processing, use and privacy and information security laws, regulations and standards by us or our third-party service providers or suppliers could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nGENERAL RISKS \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe cannot assure future growth will be achieved. \n\nWe believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2023 and beyond will be achieved. Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the &#8220;Growth Strategy&#8221; section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIn order to be successful, we will need to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. \n\nOur success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel. In order to be successful, we will need to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees. Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses to fill many of our hourly positions, which historically have had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. Our business, results of \n\n&#8203; \n\noperations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, in particular in a significant inflationary wage pressured environment, and, as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability. For a discussion of our management, see the &#8220;Business&#8221; section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRisks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies. \n\nWe expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations. Examples of such risks include the following:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; We may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Our management&#8217;s attention may be distracted. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; We may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; We may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; We may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nWe may fail, or be unable, to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we or the subsequent owner or operator may be liable.\n\n&#8203; \n\nLitigation, governmental proceedings, environmental, employment and tax legislation and regulations may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nWe are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nEnvironmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries. While it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, new or more stringent climate change-related mandates, laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing mandates, laws or regulations could potentially be forthcoming. These matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices or requiring additional expenditures by us or our suppliers to comply, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOur business is subject to employment legislation and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs. Our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation. A violation of, or change in, employment legislation and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#8203; \n\nNew tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could harm our business operations, results of operations and financial condition, and existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us, which could adversely impact our costs directly or indirectly through our suppliers and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\n&#8203; \n\n"

Properties \n\n&#8203; \n\nStores, distribution centers and other properties: \n\nOf the 5,971 stores we operated at December 31, 2022, 2,465 stores were owned, 3,436 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties, 38 of which were located in Mexico, and 70 stores were leased from entities that include one or more of our affiliated directors or members of their immediate family. Leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of, at a minimum, 10 years, subject to one or more renewals at our option. We have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby. \n\n&#8203; \n\nSuch master lease agreements with two of the five affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores. The master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from December 31, 2023, to December 31, 2029. We believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those of third parties.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe following table provides information regarding our U.S. regional DCs in operation as of December 31, 2022:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Square Footage (1) \n\nPrincipal Use \n\n&#8203; \n\nNature of Occupancy \n\n&#8203; \n\nNumber of Locations \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in thousands) \n\nDistribution center\n\n&#8203; \n\nOwned\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n9,599 \n\nDistribution center\n\n&#8203; \n\nLeased (2) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,483 \n\nTotal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n12,082 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) DC operating square footage includes floor and mezzanine operating square footage and excludes subleased square footage. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Terms expiring on dates ranging from October 31, 2024, to June 30, 2035. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIn addition, we operate six small distribution centers in Mexico; these distribution centers do not serve U.S. stores and are immaterial in the aggregate. Further enhancing our distribution capabilities in 2023, we plan to open our first DC in Puerto Rico and a large DC in Guadalajara, Mexico. \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe believe that our present facilities are in good condition, are sufficiently insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations. The store servicing capability of our 28 existing U.S. DCs is approximately 6,075 stores, providing a growth capacity of 150 to 300 U.S. stores. We believe the growth capacity in our DCs will provide us with the DC infrastructure needed for near-term expansion. However, as we expand our geographic footprint, we will continue to evaluate our existing distribution system infrastructure and will adjust our distribution system capacity as needed to support our future growth.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOur corporate office operations occur primarily in Springfield, Missouri, and as of December 31, 2022, the total square footage was 0.6 million square feet, substantially all of which was owned. \n\n&#8203; \n\n"

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both DIY customers and professional service providers &#8211; our &#8220;dual market strategy.&#8221; Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects &#8220;good,&#8221; &#8220;better,&#8221; and &#8220;best&#8221; alternatives. Our sales and total gross profit dollars are, generally, highest for the &#8220;best&#8221; quality category of products. Consumers&#8217; willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of enhanced sales and profitability in our industry. We have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as &#8220;purchasing up&#8221; on the value spectrum.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOur stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 5,929 stores in 47 U.S. states and 42 stores in Mexico.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and consumers, including, but not limited to, inflation, including rising consumer staples, fuel and energy costs, unemployment trends, interest rates and other economic factors. Future changes, such as continued broad-based inflation and rapid increases in fuel costs that exceed wage growth, may negatively impact our consumers&#8217; level of disposable income, and we cannot predict the degree these changes, or other future changes, may have on our business or industry.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe believe the key drivers of demand over the long-term for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, annual rate of light vehicle sales and average vehicle age.\n\n&#8203; \n\nNumber of Miles Driven \n\nThe number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. decreased 13.2% in 2020, as a result of responses to the coronavirus pandemic, including work from home arrangements and reduced travel. In 2021, miles driven improved and increased 11.2%, and year-to-date through November of 2022, miles driven continued to improve, increasing 1.2%. Total miles driven can be impacted by macroeconomic factors, including rapid increases in fuel cost, but we are unable to predict the degree of impact these factors may have on miles driven in the future.\n\n&#8203; \n\nSize and Age of the Vehicle Fleet \n\nThe total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by the Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 12.1% from 2011 to 2021, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 279 million by the end of 2021. In 2022, the rate of new \n\n&#8203; \n\nvehicle sales was pressured due to supply chain constraints experienced by manufacturers, and the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (&#8220;SAAR&#8221;) was below the historical average at approximately 13.3 million vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2022. From 2011 to 2021, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.1% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 11.0%, from 10.9 years in 2011 to 12.1 years in 2021. While the annual changes to the vehicle population resulting from new vehicle sales and the fluctuation in vehicle scrappage rates in any given year represent a small percentage of the total light vehicle population and have a muted impact on the total number and average age of vehicles on the road over the short term, we believe our business benefits from the current environment of new vehicle scarcity and higher than typical used vehicle prices, as consumers are more willing to continue to invest in their current vehicle.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe believe the increase in average vehicle age over the long term can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors, and the consumer&#8217;s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.\n\n&#8203; \n\nInflationary cost pressures impact our business; however, historically we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases, principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases or other input cost increases affecting the entire industry, we have typically been able to pass along these cost increases through higher selling prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O&#8217;Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service. \n\n&#8203;

Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.4% and 13.3% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on changes in sales for U.S. stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders for U.S. stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 (in millions):\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease in Sales for the Year Ended \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, 2022, \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCompared to the Same Period in 2021 \n\nStore sales: \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nComparable store sales\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nNon-comparable store sales:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nSales for U.S. stores opened throughout 2021, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales, and Mexico store sales\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nSales for U.S. stores opened throughout 2022\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nSales for stores that have closed, including temporarily closed stores\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(6) \n\nNon-store sales: \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nIncludes sales of machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal increase in sales \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n1,082 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nWe believe the increased sales are the result of store growth, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory from our regional distribution centers and hub store network, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, the Omnichannel experience, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. In addition, the strength of our distribution network and our strong supplier relationships allowed us to maintain better in-stock inventory positions than the broader market and contributed to our sales growth. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2022, was driven by increases in average ticket values for both professional service provider and DIY customers and positive transaction counts from professional service provider customers, partially offset by negative transaction counts from DIY customers. Average ticket values benefited from increases in average selling prices, on a same-SKU basis, as compared to 2021, driven by increases in acquisition costs of inventory, which were passed on in selling prices. Average ticket values also continue to be positively impacted by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. The resulting decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. The decrease in DIY customer transaction counts was driven by a challenging comparison to the strong transaction counts in 2021, which were aided by government stimulus, and broad-based inflationary pressures on the consumer.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe opened 187 and 168 net, new stores during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate new store growth will be 180 to 190 net, new store openings in 2023.\n\n&#8203; \n\nGross profit: \n\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 5% to $7.38 billion (or 51.2% of sales) from $7.02 billion (or 52.7% of sales) for the same period in 2021. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily the result of new store sales and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, was due to the impact from the rollout of our professional pricing initiative, which was a strategic investment aimed at ensuring we are more competitively priced on the professional side of our business; a greater percentage of our total sales mix generated from professional service provider customers, which carry a lower gross margin than DIY sales; and a greater benefit in the prior year from selling through inventory purchased prior to recent acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases. We determine inventory cost using the last-in, first-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;) method but had, over time, seen our LIFO reserve balance exhausted, which resulted in a LIFO inventory value above replacement cost prior to September 30, 2021. As our policy is to not write-up inventory in excess of replacement cost, we had been effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost, which resulted in a benefit when selling prices increased as we sold through this lower cost inventory. In the third quarter of 2021, our LIFO reserve reverted back to a more typical credit balance, due to the significant inflationary acquisition cost increases. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we realized the final benefit from selling through inventory valued at the older, lower replacement cost, at a lesser amount than the full year benefit received in 2021. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses: \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 8% to $4.43 billion (or 30.7% of sales) from $4.10 billion (or 30.8% of sales) for the same period in 2021. The increase in total SG&#38;A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, inflationary pressures on wages, benefits and fuel costs, as compared to the same period one year ago, and a non-cash charge associated with our transition to an enhanced paid time-off program for our Team Members. The decrease in SG&#38;A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, was principally due to leverage of fixed store operating costs on strong comparable store sales, partially offset by inflationary pressures on wages, benefits and fuel costs, as compared to the same period one year ago, and the charge associated with our transition to an enhanced paid time-off program.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOperating income: \n\nAs a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 1% to $2.95 billion (or 20.5% of sales) from $2.92 billion (or 21.9% of sales) for the same period in 2021.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOther income and expense: \n\nTotal other expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 15% to $156 million (or 1.1% of sales), from $135 million (or 1.0% of sales) for the same period in 2021. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings, as well as a decrease in the value of our trading securities, as compared to an increase in the same period in 2021. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIncome taxes: \n\nOur provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 1% to $626 million (22.4% effective tax rate) from $617 million (22.2% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2021. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of higher taxable income and lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of the lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet income: \n\nAs a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased to $2.17 billion (or 15.1% of sales), from $2.16 billion (or 16.2% of sales) for the same period in 2021.\n\n&#8203; \n\nEarnings per share: \n\nOur diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 8% to $33.44 on 65 million shares from $31.10 on 70 million shares for the same period in 2021. \n\n&#8203; \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\n&#8203; \n\nA discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 28, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol &#8220;ORLY&#8221; or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com , by clicking &#8220;Investor Relations&#8221; located at the bottom of the page. \n\n&#8203; \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur long-term business strategy requires capital to invest open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores, develop enhanced information technology systems and tools and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. Our material cash requirements necessary to maintain the current operations of our long-term business strategy include, but are not limited to, inventory purchases, human capital obligations, including payroll and benefits, contractual obligations, including debt and interest obligations, capital expenditures, payment of income taxes and other operational priorities. We expect to fund our short- and long-term cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity, which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior note offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows or maintain liquidity at or above recent levels, as we are unable to predict decreased demand for our \n\n&#8203; \n\nproducts or changes in customer buying patterns. Additionally, these factors could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur material contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2022, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements and interest payments related to long-term debt, future minimum payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, projected obligations related to future payments under the Company&#8217;s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, uncertain tax positions and associated estimated interest and penalties, payments for certain deferred income taxes and commitments for the purchase of inventory.

See page 35 for the reconciliation of the calculation of free cash flow. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nCash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the U.S. were $11.1 million and $7.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in Mexico.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOperating activities: \n\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to a larger decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings. The larger decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings was primarily due to higher accrued incentive compensation payments in 2022 versus 2021. \n\n&#8203; \n\nInvesting activities: \n\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase in store and distribution enhancement and expansion projects in 2022 versus 2021. \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe opened 187 and 168 net, new stores in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We plan to open 180 to 190 net, new stores in 2023. The costs associated with the expected openings of owned store locations in 2023, including the cost of land acquisition, building construction, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $2.8 million to $3.0 million per store; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.\n\n&#8203; \n\nFinancing activities: \n\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2022, partially offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock in 2022.\n\n&#8203; \n\n2021 Compared to 2020: \n\nA discussion of the changes in our operating activities, liquidity activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 28, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol &#8220;ORLY&#8221; or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com , by clicking &#8220;Investor Relations&#8221; located at the bottom of the page.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDebt instruments: \n\nSee Note 7 &#8220;Financing&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the Company&#8217;s credit agreement, unsecured revolving credit facility, outstanding letters of credit and unsecured senior notes. \n\n&#8203; \n\nDebt covenants: \n\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the \n\n&#8203; \n\nindentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments and five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.71 times and 6.97 times as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.73 times and 1.59 times as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203;

We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial \n\n&#8203; \n\ninformation. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n&#8203; \n\nShare repurchase program: \n\nSee Note 9 &#8220;Share Repurchase Program&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our share repurchase program. \n\n&#8203; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting estimates and assumptions to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.\n\n&#8203; \n\nSelf-Insurance Reserves: \n\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers&#8217; compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers&#8217; compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. \n\n&#8203; \n\nWhen estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Certain of the self-insurance liabilities are determined at an estimate of their net present value, using the U.S. treasury risk-free rate. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply a significant amount of subjective judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to resolve reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. The application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Management believes the assumptions developed and used to determine the estimate for our self-insurance reserve are reasonable. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur self-insurance reserve estimate included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets increased $11 million from 2021 to 2022, which is primarily due to our growing operations, inflation, increases in healthcare costs, the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience. If the underlying assumptions in management&#8217;s estimate changed self-insurance reserves 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2022, the financial impact would have been approximately $23 million or 0.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.\n\n&#8203; \n\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets: \n\nWe evaluate the carrying value of finite and indefinite long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As a component of the finite long-lived assets evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management&#8217;s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future \n\n&#8203; \n\ncash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs a component of the indefinite long-lived assets evaluation, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events or circumstances that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset have occurred, as well as if they continue to support an indefinite useful life. Areas evaluated include changes in cost factors such as raw materials or labor, financial performance including declining revenues or cash flows, the legal, regulatory and political environment, and other industry and market considerations, including the competitive environment and changes in product demand. If events or market conditions exist that would more likely than not indicate that impairment may be necessary, a detailed quantitative assessment would be performed. \n\n&#8203; \n\nBased on our qualitative assessment, we do not believe there has been a change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a calculation of fair value of indefinite long-lived assets is required as of December 31, 2022. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. See Note 6 &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangibles&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our finite and indefinite long-lived assets. \n\n&#8203; \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\n&#8203; \n\nSee Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest rate risk: \n\nWe are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;) with variable interest rates based on either an Alternative Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe had outstanding fixed rate debt of $4.4 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCash equivalents risk: \n\nWe invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $108.6 million.\n\n&#8203; \n\nForeign currency risk: \n\nForeign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities&#8217; functional currencies. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies. Our foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso-denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe view our investments in Mexican subsidiaries as long-term. The net asset exposure in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rates was $228.0 million at December 31, 2022. The year ended December 31, 2022, exchange rates of the Mexican peso, relative to the U.S. dollar, strengthened by approximately 5.2% from December 31, 2021. The potential loss in value of our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022, would be approximately $20.7 million. Any changes in our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. A 10% change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n"

The Company&#8217;s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\n&#8203; \n\nInternal control over financial reporting includes all policies and procedures that\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nManagement recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n\n&#8203; \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\n\n&#8203; \n\nErnst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n/s/\n\nGregory D.

In our opinion, O&#8217;Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n&#8203; \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n&#8203; \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP\n\n&#8203; \n\nKansas City, Missouri\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\n&#8203; \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\n&#8203; \n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of O&#8217;Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries\n\n&#8203; \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of O&#8217;Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\n&#8203; \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nValuation of Self-insurance Reserves \n\nDescription of the Matter \n\n&#8203; \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s self-insurance reserve was $233 million. As discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements, self-insurance liabilities are estimated based upon historical claim experience and trend-lines. \n\n&#8203; \n\nAuditing management&#8217;s self-insurance reserves was complex and judgmental and required us to use our actuarial specialists for certain reserves due to the estimation required in determining the ultimate claim value. The estimate is sensitive to assumptions such as the projected cost inflation, claim growth patterns and exposure forecasts. \n\n&#8203; \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design of controls over the Company&#8217;s self-insurance estimation process and tested the operating effectiveness of those controls including management&#8217;s controls over reviewing the appropriateness of assumptions and the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the reserves. \n\n&#8203; \n\nTo test the Company&#8217;s determination of the estimated self-insurance reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, involving a specialist to assist in the development of an independent actuarial \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START estimate for certain of the reserve balances based upon current industry and economic trends, comparing certain selected assumptions used by management to our independent estimates which were developed with the assistance of our specialists, testing the underlying data used by management in the development of the reserves and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1992.\n\nKansas City, Missouri \n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nO&#8217;REILLY AUTOMOTIVE, INC.

\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nO&#8217;REILLY AUTOMOTIVE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n&#8203; \n\nNOTE 1 &#8211; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n&#8203; \n\nNature of business: \n\nO&#8217;Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries, collectively, &#8220;O&#8217;Reilly&#8221; or the &#8220;Company,&#8221; is a specialty retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts. The Company&#8217;s stores carry an extensive product line, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and various automotive accessories. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned and operated 5,929 stores in 47 U.S. states and 42 stores in Mexico, servicing both do-it-yourself (&#8220;DIY&#8221;) and the professional service provider customers. The Company&#8217;s robust distribution system provides stores with same-day or overnight access to an extensive inventory of hard-to-find items not typically stocked in the stores of other auto parts retailers.\n\n&#8203; \n\nSegment reporting: \n\nThe Company is managed and operated by a single management Team reporting to the chief operating decision maker. Product sales are the only material source of revenue for the Company and the products sold by the Company have similar economic characteristics, are sourced from the Company&#8217;s suppliers in a similar manner, and are available for sale to all of the Company&#8217;s customers through the Company&#8217;s stores. The Company&#8217;s stores have similar characteristics, including the nature of the products and services, the type and class of customers and the methods used to distribute products and provide service to its customers and, as a whole, make up a single operating segment. The Company does not regularly prepare for review by the chief operating decision maker discrete financial information with respect to product categories or types of customers and, as such, has one reportable segment.\n\n&#8203; \n\nPrinciples of consolidation: \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n&#8203; \n\nUse of estimates: \n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCash equivalents: \n\nCash equivalents include investments with maturities of 90 days or less on the date of purchase. \n\n&#8203; \n\nForeign Currency: \n\nThe Company accounts for its Mexican operations using the local market currency, the Mexican peso, and converts its financial statements compiled for these operations from the Mexican peso to U.S. dollars. The cumulative gain or loss on currency translation is included as a component of &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive income&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s accumulated other comprehensive income. \n\n&#8203; \n\nAccounts receivable: \n\nThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company&#8217;s customers to make required payments. The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current expectations of future economic and industry trends, changes in customer payment terms and management&#8217;s expectations. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on historical experience and an evaluation of the current composition of accounts receivable.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company grants credit to certain professional service provider and jobber customers who meet the Company&#8217;s pre-established credit requirements. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to these receivables are limited because the Company&#8217;s customer base consists of a large number of relatively small customers, spreading the credit risk across a broad base regarded as a single class of financing receivable by the Company. The Company also controls this credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures. Generally, the Company does not require security when credit is granted to customers. Credit is granted to customers on a short-term basis, consisting primarily of daily, weekly or monthly accounts. Credit losses are provided for in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and have consistently been within management&#8217;s expectations.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nManagement does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the aggregate amounts receivable from suppliers, and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable amounts from suppliers in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n&#8203; \n\nAmounts due to the Company from its Team Members are included in &#8220;Accounts receivable&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts consist primarily of purchases of merchandise on Team Member accounts. Accounts receivable due from Team Members was approximately $ 0.8 million and $ 0.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAmounts receivable from suppliers: \n\nThe Company receives concessions from its suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for new stores and warranties, volume purchase rebates and co-operative advertising. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to the Company&#8217;s advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to the Company for changeover merchandise and product returns. The Company regularly reviews supplier receivables for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company&#8217;s suppliers&#8217; financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations. Management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the amounts receivable from suppliers and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable amounts from suppliers in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.\n\n&#8203; \n\nInventory: \n\nInventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory also includes capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution centers (&#8220;DCs&#8221;). Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;) method, which more accurately matches costs with related revenues. The replacement cost of inventory was $ 4.70 billion and $ 3.92 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n&#8203; \n\nFair value of financial instruments: \n\nThe Company uses the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure the fair value of certain of its financial instruments. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The Company uses the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 2 &#8211; Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 3 &#8211; Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nSee Note 2 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.\n\n&#8203; \n\nProperty and equipment: \n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, generally over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated economic life of the assets. The lease term includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception, for which failure to execute renewal options would result in a substantial economic penalty to the Company. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. See Note 4 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s property and equipment.\n\n&#8203; \n\nGoodwill and other intangibles: \n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, include goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as the result of acquisitions. The Company operates a single reporting unit and evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. The goodwill impairment test includes an optional qualitative assessment. The Company&#8217;s \n\n&#8203; \n\nqualitative assessment found no evidence to suggest it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. As such, no goodwill impairment adjustment was required as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Finite-lived intangibles are carried at amortized cost and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method, generally over the estimated useful lives of the intangibles. See Note 6 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s goodwill and other intangibles.\n\n&#8203; \n\nLeases: \n\nThe Company leases certain office space, retail stores, distribution centers and equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases. The Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components for any current lease contracts. Leases generally include renewal options and some include options to purchase, provisions for percentage rent based on sales and/or incremental step increase provisions. The exercise of renewal options is typically at the Company&#8217;s sole discretion and all operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company rents or subleases certain surplus real estate to third parties. Right-of-use assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities are recognized for all leases with an initial term greater than 12 months. See Note 5 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s operating leases.\n\n&#8203; \n\nImpairment of long-lived assets: \n\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, including its right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When such an event occurs, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the asset (asset group) with the carrying amounts of the asset. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment charges to its long-lived assets. See Note 4 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s impairment of long-lived assets activities.\n\n&#8203; \n\nValuation of investments: \n\nThe Company has an unsecured obligation to pay, in the future, the value of deferred compensation and a Company match relating to employee participation in the Company&#8217;s nonqualified deferred compensation plan (the &#8220;Deferred Compensation Plan&#8221;). The future obligation is adjusted to reflect the performance, whether positive or negative, of selected investment measurement options, chosen by each participant. The Company invests in various marketable securities with the intention of selling these securities to fulfill its future obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The investments in this plan were stated at fair value based on quoted market prices, were accounted for as trading securities and were included in &#8220;Other assets, net&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 2 for further information concerning the fair value measurements of the Company&#8217;s marketable securities. See Note 12 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s benefit plans.\n\n&#8203; \n\nVariable Interest Entities: \n\nThe Company invests in certain tax credit funds that promote renewable energy. These investments generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits and other tax benefits. The Company accounts for the tax attributes of its renewable energy investments using the deferral method. Under this method, realized investment tax credits and other tax benefits are recognized as a reduction of the renewable energy investments. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company has determined its investment in these tax credit funds were investments in variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;). The Company analyzes any investments in VIEs at inception and again if certain triggering events are identified to determine if it is the primary beneficiary. The Company considers a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIEs&#8217; economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had invested in six unconsolidated tax credit fund entities that were considered to be VIEs and concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of any of the entities, as it did not have the power to control the activities that most significantly impact the entities, and has therefore accounted for these investments using the equity method. The Company&#8217;s maximum exposure to losses associated with these VIEs is generally limited to its net investment, which was $ 38.0 million as of December 31, 2022, and was included in &#8220;Other assets, net&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized investment tax credits in the amounts of $ 167.6 million, $ 177.1 million and $ 170.5 million, respectively, all of which were realized through reductions in cash income taxes paid and were reflected as a component of the change in Income taxes payable on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the respective years. \n\n&#8203; \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into two agreements to invest in additional tax credit funds, which promote renewable energy through the development of solar energy farms, primarily for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax \n\n&#8203; \n\ncredits. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had commitments to make certain additional capital contributions to its tax credit funds totaling approximately $ 3.4 million upon achievement of project milestones by the solar energy farms, the timing of which is uncertain and outside of the Company&#8217;s control. See Note 15 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s investment in renewable energy tax credits.\n\n&#8203; \n\nSelf-insurance reserves: \n\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities for Team Member health care benefits, workers&#8217; compensation, vehicle liability, general liability and property loss. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, the Company obtains third-party insurance coverage to limit its exposure. The Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected cost inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. Certain of these liabilities were recorded at an estimate of their net present value.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe following table identifies the components of the Company&#8217;s self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSelf-insurance reserves (undiscounted)\n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n245,562 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n233,185 \n\nSelf-insurance reserves (discounted)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n233,017 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n222,273 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nThe current portion of the Company&#8217;s discounted self-insurance reserves totaled $ 138.9 million and $ 128.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was included in &#8220;Self-insurance reserves&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The remainder was included in &#8220;Other liabilities&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWarranties: \n\nThe Company provides warranties on certain merchandise it sells with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of the Company&#8217;s suppliers. Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to the Company in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, the Company bears the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between supplier allowances received by the Company, in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense, are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. The Company&#8217;s historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims to the Company has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. See Note 8 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s aggregate product warranty liabilities.\n\n&#8203; \n\nLitigation accruals: \n\nThe Company is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company&#8217;s business. Based on existing facts and historical patterns, the Company accrues for litigation losses in instances where an adverse outcome is probable and the Company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 450-20. The Company also accrues for an estimate of legal costs to be incurred for litigation matters. Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from legal matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters, taking into account applicable insurance and accruals, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.\n\n&#8203; \n\nShare repurchases: \n\nIn January of 2011, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. Under the program, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. All shares repurchased under the share repurchase program are retired and recorded under the par value method on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 9 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRevenue recognition: \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is derived from the sale of automotive aftermarket parts and merchandise to its customers. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, in an amount representing the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. Generally, the \n\n&#8203; \n\nCompany&#8217;s performance obligations are satisfied when the customer takes possession of the merchandise, which normally occurs immediately at the point of sale or through same day delivery of the merchandise. All sales are recorded net of estimated returns allowances, discounts and taxes. The Company does not recognize revenue related to product warranties, as these are considered assurance warranty obligations. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOver-the-counter retail sales to DIY customers are recorded when the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Internet retail sales, included in sales to DIY customers, are recorded when the merchandise is shipped or when the customer picks up the merchandise at a store. Sales to professional service provider customers, also referred to as &#8220;commercial sales,&#8221; are recorded upon same-day delivery of the merchandise to the customer, generally at the customer&#8217;s place of business. Other sales and sales adjustments primarily includes sales to Team Members, wholesale sales to other retailers (&#8220;jobber sales&#8221;), equipment sales, discounts, rebates, deferred revenue adjustments relating to the Company&#8217;s retail loyalty program and adjustments to estimated sales returns allowances. Sales to Team Members are recorded when the Team Member takes possession of the merchandise. Jobber sales are recorded upon shipment of the merchandise from a regional distribution center with same-day delivery to the jobber customer&#8217;s location.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company maintains a retail loyalty program named O&#8217;Reilly O&#8217;Rewards, which represents a performance obligation. The Company records a deferred revenue liability, based on a breakage adjusted, estimated redemption rate and a corresponding reduction in revenue in periods when loyalty points are earned by members. The Company recognizes revenue and a corresponding reduction to the deferred revenue liability in periods when loyalty program issued coupons are redeemed by members, generally within a period of three months from issuance, or when unredeemed points expire, generally within 12 months after the date they were earned, which satisfies the Company&#8217;s performance obligation. See Note 11 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s revenue.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses: \n\nBelow follows the primary costs classified in each major expense category.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Total cost of merchandise sold, including freight expenses associated with acquiring merchandise and with moving merchandise inventories from the Company&#8217;s distribution centers to the stores; and defective merchandise and warranty costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Supplier allowances and incentives, including allowances that are not reimbursements for specific, incremental and identifiable costs; and cash discounts on payments to suppliers. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Costs associated with the Company&#8217;s supply chain, including payroll and benefit costs; warehouse occupancy costs; transportation costs; depreciation; and inventory shrinkage. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nSelling general and administrative expenses:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Payroll benefit costs for store and corporate Team Members; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Occupancy costs of store and corporate facilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Depreciation and amortization related to store and corporate assets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Vehicle expenses for store and Hub delivery services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Self-insurance costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Closed store expenses; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Other administrative costs, including accounting, legal and other professional services; bad debt, banking and credit card fees; supplies; travel; and advertising costs ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nAdvertising expenses: \n\nAdvertising expense consists primarily of expenses related to the Company&#8217;s integrated marketing program, which includes radio, in-store, digital and social media promotions, as well as sports and event sponsorships and direct mail and newspaper promotional distribution. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. The Company also participates in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of its suppliers. Advertising expense, net of cooperative advertising allowances from suppliers that were incremental to the advertising program, specific to the product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, total $ 81.5 million, $ 72.5 million and $ 73.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were included in &#8220;Selling, general and administrative expenses&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n&#8203; \n\nShare-based compensation and benefit plans: \n\nThe Company sponsors share-based compensation plans and benefit plans. The Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period for its share-based plans based on the fair value of the awards on the date of the grant, award or issuance and \n\n&#8203; \n\naccounts for forfeitures as they occur. Share-based plans include stock option awards, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights issued under the Company&#8217;s incentive plans and stock issued through the Company&#8217;s employee stock purchase plan. See Note 12 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s share-based compensation and benefit plans.\n\n&#8203; \n\nPre-opening expenses: \n\nCosts associated with the opening of new stores, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are charged to &#8220;Selling, general and administrative expenses&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as incurred. Costs associated with the opening of new distribution centers, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are included in &#8220;Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as incurred.\n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest expense: \n\nThe Company capitalizes interest costs as a component of construction in progress, based on the weighted-average interest rates incurred on its long-term borrowings. Total interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $ 5.5 million, $ 7.0 million and $ 10.2 million, respectively.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIn conjunction with the issuance or amendment of long-term debt instruments, the Company incurs various costs, including debt registration fees, accounting and legal fees and underwriter and book runner fees. Debt issuance costs related to the Company&#8217;s long-term unsecured senior notes are recorded as a reduction of the principal amount of the corresponding unsecured senior notes. Debt issuance costs related to the Company&#8217;s unsecured revolving credit facility are recorded as an asset. These debt issuance costs have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt instrument and the amortization expense is included in &#8220;Interest expense&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred debt issuance costs totaled $ 24.7 million and $ 22.0 million net of accumulated amortization, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $ 2.6 million and $ 3.4 million were included in &#8220;Other assets, net&#8221; as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with the remainder included in &#8220;Long-term debt&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company issued its long-term unsecured senior notes at a discount. The original issuance discounts on the senior notes are recorded as a reduction of the principal amount of the corresponding senior notes and are accreted over the term of the applicable senior note, with the accretion expense included in &#8220;Interest expense&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Original issuance discounts, net of accretion, totaled $ 6.3 million and $ 4.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n&#8203; \n\nSee Note 7 for further information concerning debt issuance costs and original issuance discounts associated with the Company&#8217;s issuances of long-term debt instruments.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIncome taxes: \n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the U.S. GAAP basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rules and rates currently scheduled to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Tax carry forwards are also recognized in deferred tax assets and liabilities under this method. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date. The Company would record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not the amount will not be realized, based upon evidence available at the time of the determination and any change in the valuation allowance is recorded in the period of a change in such determination. The Company did not establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, as it was considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets were realizable through a combination of future taxable income, the realization of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company regularly reviews its potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. In management&#8217;s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of the Company&#8217;s potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company&#8217;s various tax positions and actual results could differ from estimates. See Note 15 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s income taxes.\n\n&#8203; \n\nEarnings per share: \n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the common stock equivalents associated with the potential impact of dilutive stock options. Certain common stock equivalents that \n\n&#8203; \n\ncould potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been antidilutive. Generally, stock options are antidilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation when the exercise price exceeds the market price of the common shares. See Note 16 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s common stock equivalents.\n\n&#8203; \n\nNew accounting pronouncements: \n\nIn September of 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2022- 04, &#8220;Liabilities &#8211; Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.&#8221; ASU 2022-04 enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs. Under ASU 2022-04, a buyer in a supplier finance program would be required to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program&#8217;s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude. ASU 2022-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within that reporting period, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. ASU 2022-04 allows for early adoption and requires retrospective adoption, except on rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. The Company will adopt this guidance beginning with its first quarter ending March 31, 2023. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, as the guidance pertains to disclosure.\n\n&#8203; \n\nNOTE 2 &#8211; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\n&#8203; \n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: \n\nThe Company invests in various marketable securities with the intention of selling these securities to fulfill its future unsecured obligations under the Company&#8217;s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. See Note 12 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s benefit plans.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s marketable securities were accounted for as trading securities and the carrying amount of its marketable securities were included in &#8220;Other assets, net&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company recorded a decrease in fair value related to its marketable securities in the amount of $ 8.3 million and an increase in fair value to its related to its marketable securities in the amount of $ 5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included in &#8220;Other income (expense)&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe tables below identify the estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s marketable securities, determined by reference to quoted market prices (Level 1), as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nQuoted Priced in Active Markets \n\n&#8203; \n\nSignificant Other \n\n&#8203; \n\nSignificant \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nfor Identical Instruments \n\n&#8203; \n\nObservable Inputs \n\n&#8203; \n\nUnobservable Inputs \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Level 1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(Level 2) \n\n&#160; \n\n(Level 3) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nMarketable securities \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n49,371 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n49,371 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets\n\n&#8203; \n\nSignificant Other\n\n&#8203; \n\nSignificant\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nfor Identical Instruments\n\n&#8203; \n\nObservable Inputs\n\n&#8203; \n\nUnobservable Inputs\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Level 1)\n\n&#160;\n\n(Level 2)\n\n&#160;\n\n(Level 3)\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\nMarketable securities\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n52,456 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n52,456 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nNon-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: \n\nCertain long-lived non-financial assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in certain circumstances, including when there is evidence of impairment.

\n\nThe future minimum lease payments under the Company&#8217;s operating leases, in the table above, do not include potential amounts for percentage rent and other variable operating lease related costs and have not been reduced by expected future minimum sublease income under non-cancelable subleases, which was approximately $ 13.2 million as of December 31, 2022. The weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for the Company&#8217;s operating leases was 9.6 years and 4.0 %, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe present value discount component of the future minimum lease payments under the Company&#8217;s operating leases, in the table above, was primarily calculated using the Company&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement or modification date. Inputs for the calculation of the Company&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate include valuations and yields of U.S. domestic investment grade corporate bonds and the applicable credit spread over comparable U.S. Treasury rates, adjusted to a collateralized basis by estimating the credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade of one ratings classification.

The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $ 1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;) arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in June of 2026. The Credit Agreement includes a $ 200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $ 75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company may, from time to time, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $ 900 million, provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed $ 2.7 billion at any time.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers&#8217; compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, under the Credit Agreement in the amounts of $ 5.1 million and $ 84.0 \n\n&#8203; \n\nmillion, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Credit Agreement by those amounts. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at the Company&#8217;s option, at either an Alternate Base Rate or an Adjusted LIBO Rate (both as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin, which will vary from 0.000 % to 0.250 % in the case of loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate and 0.680 % to 1.250 % in the case of loans bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody&#8217;s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. The Credit Agreement includes customary provisions to provide for the eventual replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at an Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin for Alternate Base Rate loans. In addition, the Company pays a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Credit Agreement in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.070 % to 0.250 % per annum. The interest rate margins and facility fee are based upon the better of the ratings assigned to the Company&#8217;s debt by Moody&#8217;s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services, subject to limited exceptions. As of December 31, 2022, based upon the Company&#8217;s current credit ratings, its margin for Alternate Base Rate loans was 0.000 %, its margin for Eurodollar Revolving Loans was 0.900 % and its facility fee was 0.100 %.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on subsidiary indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50 :1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 :1.00. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments and five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that the Company should default on any covenant (subject to customary grace periods, cure rights and materiality thresholds) contained in the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from lenders. As of December 31, 2022, the Company remained in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition to the letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement described above, as of December 31, 2022, the Company had other outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations under workers&#8217; compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $ 96.6 million. Substantially all of these letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance and were not issued under the Company&#8217;s Credit Agreement or another committed facility.\n\n&#8203; \n\nSenior notes: \n\nOn June 15, 2022 , the Company issued $ 850 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.700 % Senior Notes due 2032 (&#8220; 4.700 % Senior Notes due 2032&#8221;) at a price to the public of 99.684 % of their face value with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (&#8220;U.S. Bank&#8221;) as trustee. Interest on the 4.700 % Senior Notes due 2032 is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2022, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOn September 1, 2022, the Company&#8217;s $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800 % Senior Notes due 2022 matured, and the Company repaid these notes using available cash on hand.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has issued and outstanding a cumulative $ 4.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, which are due between 2023 and 2032, with UMB Bank, N.A. and U.S. Bank Trust Company as trustees. Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 1.750 % to 4.700 %, is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year. The $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.850 % Senior Notes due 2023 were included in &#8220;Long-term debt&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance these notes on a long-term basis.

The Company makes matching contributions equal to 100 % of the first 2% of each employee&#8217;s wages that are contributed and 25 % of the next 4% of each employee&#8217;s wages that are contributed. An employee generally must be employed on December 31 to receive that year&#8217;s Company matching contribution, with the matching contribution funded annually at the beginning of the subsequent year following the year in which the matching contribution was earned. The Company may also make additional discretionary profit sharing contributions to the plan on an annual basis as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company did not make any discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan during the years ended \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. The Company expensed matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan in the amounts of $ 36.7 million, $ 32.5 million and $ 31.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were primarily included in &#8220;Selling, general and administrative expenses&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n&#8203; \n\nNonqualified deferred compensation plan: \n\nThe Company sponsors a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (the &#8220;Deferred Compensation Plan&#8221;) for highly compensated employees whose contributions to the 401(k) Plan are limited due to the application of the annual limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. The Deferred Compensation Plan provides these employees with the opportunity to defer the full 6% of matched compensation, including salary and incentive based compensation, that was precluded under the Company&#8217;s 401(k) Plan, which is then matched by the Company using the same formula as the 401(k) Plan. An employee generally must be employed on December 31 to receive that year&#8217;s Company matching contribution, with the matching contribution funded annually at the beginning of the subsequent year following the year in which the matching contribution was earned. In the event of bankruptcy, the assets of this plan are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. The Company has an unsecured obligation to pay, in the future, the value of the deferred compensation and Company match, adjusted to reflect the performance, whether positive or negative, of selected investment measurement options chosen by each participant during the deferral period. The timing related to the ultimate payment of these future share-based compensation related payments cannot be determined. The liability for compensation deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan was $ 49.4 million and $ 52.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included in &#8220;Other liabilities&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company expensed matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan in the amount of $ 0.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were included in &#8220;Selling, general and administrative expenses&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n&#8203; \n\nStock appreciation rights: \n\nThe Company&#8217;s incentive plans provide for the granting of stock appreciation rights, which expire after 10 years and vest 25 % per year, over four years , and are settled in cash. There were 13,159 and 9,811 stock appreciation rights outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were 3,348 stock appreciation rights granted. The liability for compensation to be paid for redeemed stock appreciation rights was $ 2.9 million and $ 1.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included in &#8220;Other liabilities&#8221; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recorded compensation expense for stock appreciation rights in the amounts of $ 1.7 million and $ 1.0 million and $ 0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were included in &#8220;Selling, general and administrative expenses&#8221; on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNOTE 13 &#8211; COMMITMENTS \n\n&#8203; \n\nConstruction commitments: \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had purchase obligations for construction contract commitments in the amount of $ 152.3 million. \n\n&#8203; \n\nLetters of credit commitments: \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to satisfy workers&#8217; compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $ 101.7 million. See Note 7 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s letters of credit commitments.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDebt financing commitments: \n\nEach series of senior notes is redeemable in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, at the Company&#8217;s option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, equal to the greater of (i) 100 % of the principal amount thereof or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the applicable Treasury Yield plus basis points identified in the indenture governing such series of senior notes; provided, that on or after the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the series of senior notes, such series of senior notes is redeemable at a redemption price equal to par plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, if at any time the Company undergoes a Change of Control Triggering Event, as defined in the indenture governing such series of senior notes, the holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their senior notes at a price equal to 101 % of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but not including the repurchase date. See Note 7 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s debt financing commitments.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nSelf-insurance reserves: \n\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities for Team Member health care benefits, workers&#8217; compensation, vehicle liability, general liability and property loss. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, the Company obtains third-party insurance coverage to limit its exposure to this obligation. See Note 1 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s self-insurance reserves. \n\n&#8203; \n\nRenewable energy tax credit equity investments: \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements to make capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is required to make capital contributions totaling approximately $ 3.4 million upon achievement of project milestones by the solar energy farms, the timing of which is uncertain and outside of the Company&#8217;s control. See Note 1 for further information concerning the Company&#8217;s renewable energy tax credit equity investments. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNOTE 14 &#8211; RELATED PARTIES \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company leases certain land and buildings related to 70 of its O&#8217;Reilly Auto Parts stores and two surplus properties under fifteen - or twenty-year operating lease agreements with entities that include one or more of the Company&#8217;s affiliated directors or members of an affiliated director&#8217;s immediate family. Generally, these lease agreements provide for renewal options for an additional five years at the option of the Company and the lease agreements are periodically modified to further extend the lease term for specific stores under the agreements. Lease payments under these operating leases totaled $ 4.7 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company believes that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.

The timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these uncertain tax positions cannot be determined. All of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020 , respectively, would affect the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate if recognized, generally net of the federal tax effect of approximately $ 6.2 million. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had accrued approximately $ 3.5 million, $ 3.8 million and $ 5.0 million, respectively, of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions before the benefit of the deduction for interest on state and federal returns. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded tax expense related to an increase in its liability for interest and penalties in the amounts of $ 1.5 million, $ 1.6 million and $ 2.2 million, respectively. Although unrecognized tax benefits for individual tax positions may increase or decrease during 2023, the Company expects a reduction of $ 5.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits during the one-year period subsequent to December 31, 2022, resulting from settlement or expiration of the statute of limitations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s United States federal income tax returns for tax years 2019 and beyond remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.

Controls and Procedures \n\n&#8203; \n\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company&#8217;s management, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) and as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS \n\n&#8203; \n\nThere were no changes in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n&#8203; \n\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company&#8217;s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\n&#8203; \n\nInternal control over financial reporting includes all policies and procedures that\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nManagement recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n\n&#8203; \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\n\n&#8203; \n\nErnst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n"
