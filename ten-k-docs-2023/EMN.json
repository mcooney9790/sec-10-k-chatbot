BUSINESS ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Page Corporate Overview \n\nBusiness Strategy \n\nFinancial Strategy \n\nBusiness Segments \n\nAdvanced Materials Segment \n\nAdditives &#38; Functional Products Segment \n\nChemical Intermediates Segment \n\nFibers Segment \n\nEastman Chemical Company General Information \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START CORPORATE OVERVIEW ##TABLE_END\n\nEastman Chemical Company (\"Eastman\" or the \"Company\") is a global specialty materials company that produces a broad range of products found in items people use every day. Eastman began business in 1920 for the purpose of producing chemicals for Eastman Kodak Company's photographic business and became a public company, incorporated in Delaware, on December 31, 1993. Eastman has 35 manufacturing facilities and has equity interests in two manufacturing joint ventures in 12 countries that supply products to customers throughout the world. See \"Properties\" in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \"Annual Report\"). The Company's headquarters and largest manufacturing facility are located in Kingsport, Tennessee. With a robust portfolio of specialty businesses, Eastman works with customers to deliver innovative products and solutions with commitment to safety and sustainability. Eastman's businesses are managed and reported in four operating segments: Advanced Materials (\"AM\"), Additives &#38; Functional Products (\"AFP\"), Chemical Intermediates (\"CI\"), and Fibers. See \"Business Segments\". \n\nIn the first years as a stand-alone company, Eastman was diversified between commodity and more specialty chemical businesses. Beginning in 2004, the Company refocused its strategy and changed its businesses and portfolio of products, first by the divestiture and discontinuance of under-performing assets and commodity businesses and initiatives (including divestiture in 2004 of resins, inks, and monomers product lines, divestiture in 2006 of the polyethylene business, and divestiture from 2007 to 2010 of the polyethylene terephthalate (\"PET\") assets and business). The Company then pursued growth through the development and acquisition of more specialty businesses and product lines by inorganic acquisition and integration (including acquisitions of Solutia, Inc., a global leader in performance materials and specialty chemicals in 2012, and Taminco Corporation, a global specialty chemical company in 2014) and organic development and commercialization of new and enhanced technologies and products. \n\nEastman uses an innovation-driven growth model which consists of leveraging world class scalable technology platforms, delivering differentiated application development capabilities, and relentlessly engaging the market. The Company's world class technology platforms form the foundation of sustainable growth by differentiated products through significant scale advantages in research and development (\"R&#38;D\") and advantaged global market access. Molecular recycling technologies continue to be an area of investment focus for the Company and extend the level of differentiation afforded by its world class technology platforms. Differentiated application development converts market complexity into opportunities for growth and accelerates innovation by enabling a deeper understanding of the value of Eastman's products and how they perform within customers' and end-users' products. Key areas of application development include thermoplastic conversion, functional films, coatings formulations, textiles and nonwovens, animal nutrition, and personal and home care formulations. The Company engages the market by working directly with customers and downstream users, targeting attractive niche markets, and leveraging disruptive macro trends. Management believes that these elements of the Company's innovation-driven growth model, combined with disciplined portfolio management and balanced capital deployment, are transforming Eastman into a global specialty materials company that enhances the quality of life in a material way. As a global specialty materials company, management continuously evaluates the Company's business and operations to improve cost structure, increase investment in growth, and strengthen execution capabilities, including specific initiatives to transform operations, work processes and systems, and business structure alignment, scale, and integration. As part of the continuous evaluation, the Company divested its rubber additives product line in 2021 and its adhesives resins assets and business in 2022, due to earnings volatility that was not in line with Eastman's expectations for the performance of a specialty business. \n\nIn 2022, the Company reported sales revenue of $10.6 billion, earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") of $1.2 billion, and net earnings attributable to Eastman of $793 million. Diluted earnings per share were $6.35. Net cash provided by operating activities was $975 million. Excluding non-core and unusual items, adjusted EBIT was $1.3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.88. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for reconciliation of financial measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") to non-GAAP financial measures, description of excluded items, and related information. For Company sales revenue by end-use market, see Exhibit 99.01 \"2022 Company and Segment Sales Revenue by End-Use Market\" of this Annual Report. Approximately 60 percent of 2022 sales revenue was generated from outside the United States and Canada region. For additional information regarding sales by customer location and by segment, see Note 20, \"Segment and Regional Sales Information\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary by Operating Segment\", \"Sales by Customer Location\", and \"Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report. \n\nBUSINESS STRATEGY \n\nEastman's objective is to be a global specialty materials company that enhances the quality of life in a material way with consistent, sustainable earnings growth and strong cash flow. Integral to the Company's strategy for growth is leveraging its heritage expertise and innovation within its cellulosic biopolymer and acetyl, olefins, polyester, and alkylamine chemistries. For each of these \"streams\", the Company has developed and acquired a combination of assets and technologies that combine scale and integration across multiple manufacturing units and sites as a competitive advantage. Management uses an innovation-driven growth model which consists of leveraging world class scalable technology platforms, delivering differentiated application development, and relentlessly engaging the market. The Company sells differentiated products into diverse markets and geographic regions and engages the market by collaborating and co-innovating with customers and downstream users in existing and new niche markets to creatively solve problems. Management believes that this innovation-driven growth model will enable the Company to leverage its proven technology capabilities to improve product mix, increasing emphasis on specialty businesses, and sustaining and expanding market share through leadership in attractive niche markets. The Company's strategy will also focus on organic growth initiatives and targeted bolt-on acquisitions. \n\nInnovation \n\nManagement is pursuing specific opportunities to leverage Eastman's innovation-driven growth model with the goal of greater than end-market growth by both sustaining the Company's leadership in existing markets and expanding into new markets. Recently developed, introduced, or commercialized innovation products, applications, and technologies include the following: \n\n&#8226; Molecular recycling technologies, carbon renewal technology, and polyester renewal technology which are being used for production and commercial sales of multiple products, described below under \" Sustainability and Circular Economy \"; \n\n&#8226; Eastman Tritan &#8482; Renew copolyester based on polyester renewal technology which transforms single-use polyester waste into basic building blocks that are then used to make durable, high performance materials; \n\n&#8226; Naia &#8482; Renew, a fiber product for the apparel market developed from proprietary cellulosic biopolymer technology; \n\n&#8226; Saflex &#8482; E series, an enhanced acoustic interlayer product, formulated to dampen sound, particularly in the high frequency range, and provides improved performance compared to traditional acoustic interlayers; \n\n&#8226; Saflex &#8482; Horizon, a next generation polyvinyl butyral (\"PVB\") interlayer product, supports the longer virtual image distance, expanded field of view, and augmented reality features of advanced Head-up Displays (\"HUD\") systems; \n\n&#8226; Tetrashield &#8482; performance polyester resins based on proprietary monomer technology with improved performance and sustainability features for packaging, industrial, and automotive coatings end-users; \n\n&#8226; Eastapure &#8482; , an ultra high purity solvent portfolio for electronic and semiconductor customers requiring products with extremely low organic and inorganic impurities, and particulates; \n\n&#8226; Performance films innovations in automotive and architectural window films and paint protection films and expanded adoption of Eastman CORE (trademark and patent pending), a software platform that provides automotive dealership groups and professional installers access to shop management and automotive film patterns to improve installation quality and customer experience; and \n\n&#8226; Cellulosic biopolymers including addition of new microbeads for personal care applications including color cosmetics, sunscreens, and facial lotions, and Aventa&#8482; for use in food service applications. \n\nSustainability and Circular Economy \n\nCentral to Eastman's innovation-driven growth model is management's dedication to enhance the quality of life in a material way with an ongoing commitment to sustainability. \n\nThe Company's long history of technical expertise in chemical processes and polymer science position it to provide innovative solutions to some of the world's most complex problems. Eastman is contributing to development of a more \"circular economy\". A circular economy focuses on making the most of the world's resources - minimizing waste and maximizing value - by providing end-of-life solutions to reduce, reuse, and recycle products and materials. This keeps materials in use and decouples growth from scarce resource consumption, allowing economic development and improvement in quality of life within natural resource limits. The Company's sustainable innovation initiatives include biodegradation, molecular recycling, and strategic collaborations with end-user markets. In 2019, the Company announced the use of its unique platform of solutions to address the challenges of plastic waste in the environment with advanced circular recycling, or molecular recycling, including carbon renewal and polyester renewal technologies. Together, these technologies allow the Company to use plastic waste, such as polyester carpet and textiles, as feedstock and lower greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions compared to traditional processes. Eastman's scale and integration provide a unique opportunity to accelerate the use of these molecular recycling technologies and make a meaningful positive impact on the environment. \n\nManagement approaches sustainability as a source of competitive strength by focusing its innovation strategy on opportunities where disruptive macro trends align with the Company's differentiated technology platforms and applications development capabilities to develop innovative products, applications, and technologies that enable customers' development and sale of sustainable products. Eastman's sustainability-related growth initiatives include targeted product and process innovation that focuses on enhancing product health and safety, end-use product durability, recyclability, and reducing material usage, while lowering GHG emissions associated with climate change. Eastman has focused on communication and collaboration with stakeholders, including policymakers and other interested parties, to build support for the concepts of molecular recycling and mass balance accounting (an accepted and certified protocol that documents and tracks recycled content through complex manufacturing systems). Eastman has committed to reduce its absolute scope 1 (direct GHG emissions occurring from sources that are owned by Eastman) and scope 2 (indirect GHG associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling and are a result of Eastman's energy use) emissions by approximately one-third by 2030 in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and to innovate to provide products that enable energy savings and GHG emissions reductions to customers and end-users. \n\nEastman focuses on the triple challenge of Climate, Circularity, and Caring for Society. Examples of Eastman sustainable solutions within identified disruptive macro trends include: \n\n&#8226; Climate: \n\n&#8226; Eastman's molecular recycling processes are expected to reduce GHG emissions by 20 percent to 50 percent when compared to processes using fossil fuels for intermediates used in various Renew products; \n\n&#8226; Saflex &#8482; Q series advanced acoustic interlayers enables weight reduction of vehicles; \n\n&#8226; Solar-absorbing Saflex &#8482; PVB interlayer solutions, such as the Saflex &#8482; S series, Saflex &#8482; Solar Connect, and XIR &#8482; Solar Control Technology, are ideal for electric vehicle (\"EV\") glass in cabin-forward designs and for larger sunroofs, as they reduce loads on air-conditioning systems and help maximize EV driving range; \n\n&#8226; LLumar &#8482; and SunTek &#8482; performance films, in the building and construction market, provide energy savings of 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on glass and film type; and \n\n&#8226; Eastman specialty solvents reduce volatile organic compounds (\"VOC\"). \n\n&#8226; Circularity: \n\n&#8226; Eastman's molecular recycling technology, including carbon renewal and polyester renewal technologies, utilizes plastic waste as a feedstock. Products made with certified recycled content (allocated by International Sustainability &#38; Carbon Certification (\"ISCC\") mass balance) include: \n\n&#8226; Tritan &#8482; Renew copolyesters \n\n&#8226; Acetate Renew cellulosic biopolymers \n\n&#8226; Tr&#275;va &#8482; Renew cellulosic biopolymers \n\n&#8226; Cristal &#8482; Renew copolyesters \n\n&#8226; Naia &#8482; Renew cellulosic yarn \n\n&#8226; Aventa&#8482; Renew cellulosic biopolymers \n\n&#8226; Eastman expects the methanolysis manufacturing plant in Kingsport, Tennessee to begin commissioning and startup activities by early summer 2023, and approximately 75 percent of required feedstock for the facility is being procured today, under contract, or in active negotiation; \n\n&#8226; Eastman made significant progress in 2022 on a material-to-material molecular recycling facility in Port-J&#233;r&#244;me-sur-Seine, France. This facility will use Eastman's polyester renewal technology to initially recycle up to 110,000 metric tons annually of hard-to-recycle plastic waste. Additionally, a long-term supply agreement was reached in September 2022 that will provide up to 20,000 metric tons per year of feedstock for this facility; and \n\n&#8226; Eastman reached a definitive supply agreement in October 2022 for a planned third molecular recycling facility that will be located in the United States. \n\n&#8226; Caring for Society: \n\n&#8226; Tetrashield &#8482; performance polyester resins provide Bisphenol A-non intent (\"BPA-NI\") can coating for food and beverage applications; \n\n&#8226; Animal nutrition solutions, including Eastman organic acids and proprietary feed additives for feeding the world, are antibiotic free; \n\n&#8226; Saflex &#8482; PVB and HUD acoustic interlayers in the automotive sector are essential to ensure passenger safety. Eastman's materials enable the adoption of digital technologies within the cabin and further advance improvements in solar, heat, and ultraviolet management; and \n\n&#8226; Eastman medical polymers provide quality and durability to healthcare providers while ensuring safety for their patients. \n\nFINANCIAL STRATEGY \n\nIn its management of the Company's businesses and growth initiatives, management is committed to maintaining a strong financial position with appropriate financial flexibility and liquidity. Management believes maintaining a financial profile that supports an investment grade credit rating is important to its long-term strategy and financial flexibility. The Company employs a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation and deployment of cash. The priorities for uses of available cash include payment of the quarterly dividend, funding targeted growth opportunities, repurchasing shares, and repayment of debt. Management expects that the combination of continued strong cash flow generation, a strong balance sheet, and sufficient liquidity will continue to provide flexibility to pursue growth initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_START BUSINESS SEGMENTS ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Advanced Materials (\"AM\"), Additives &#38; Functional Products (\"AFP\"), Chemical Intermediates (\"CI\"), and Fibers. This organizational structure is based on the management of the strategies, operating models, and sales channels that the various businesses employ and supports the Company's continued transformation towards a global specialty materials company.

Management believes that the ability to leverage the AFP segment's research, differentiated application development, and production capabilities across multiple markets uniquely positions it to meet evolving needs to improve the quality and performance of its customers' products. For example, Eastman BPA-NI Tetrashield &#8482; protective resins enable metal packaging coatings formulation with a unique balance of durability and flexibility, improving performance, regulatory compliance, shelf life, and consumer safety. Such protective resins can also be used in protective coatings, industrial coatings and automotive coatings. The Company is also developing solutions to address the environmental challenges caused by non-biodegradable microplastics in personal care products by leveraging its world-class biodegradable cellulosic biopolymer technology platform in biodegradable microbeads for personal care application. \n\nIn 2022, the AFP segment: \n\n&#8226; expanded capacity and capabilities of Eastapure &#8482; electronic solvents for use in manufacturing of semiconductor chips and other electronic applications with extremely low organic and inorganic impurities; \n\n&#8226; realized additional production capacity across its Global Alkylamines assets through optimization projects; and \n\n&#8226; continued global launch of Fluid Genius &#8482; , a patent-pending product that equips end-users with predictive insights to optimize heat transfer fluid performance by leveraging artificial intelligence technology with Eastman expertise to monitor and maximize the life cycle of heat transfer fluids for a myriad of system applications. \n\nIn response to market and business conditions, the Company divested its adhesives resins assets and business in 2022. The sale consisted of hydrocarbon resins (including Eastman Impera &#8482; tire resins), pure monomer resins, polyolefin polymers, rosins and dispersions, and oleochemical and fatty-acid based resins product lines. \n\nCHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES SEGMENT \n\nOverview \n\nEastman leverages large scale and vertical integration from the cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl, olefins, and alkylamines streams to support the Company's specialty operating segments with advantaged cost positions. The CI segment sells excess intermediates beyond the Company's internal specialty needs into end-markets such as industrial chemicals and processing, building and construction, health and wellness, and agrochemicals. Key technology platforms include acetyls, oxos, plasticizers, polyesters, and alkylamines. \n\nThe CI segment product lines benefit from competitive cost positions primarily resulting from the use of and access to lower cost raw materials, and the Company's scale, technology, and operational excellence. Examples include coal used in the production of cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl stream product lines, propylene and ethylene used in the production of olefin derivative product lines such as oxo alcohols and plasticizers, and ammonia and methanol used to manufacture methylamines. The CI segment also provides superior reliability to customers through its backward integration into readily available raw materials, such as propane, ethane, coal, and propylene. See \"Eastman Chemical Company General Information - Manufacturing Streams\". \n\nSeveral CI segment product lines are affected by cyclicality, most notably olefin and acetyl-based products. This cyclicality is caused by periods of supply and demand imbalance, when either incremental capacity additions are not offset by corresponding increases in demand, or when demand exceeds existing supply. While management continues to take steps to reduce the impact of the trough of these cycles, future results are expected to fluctuate due to both general economic conditions and industry supply and demand. \n\nPrincipal Products ##TABLE_START Product Description Principal Competitors Key Raw Materials End-Use Applications Functional Amines Alkylamines \n\nmethylamines and salts higher amines and solvents \n\nBASF SE \n\nUS Amines Limited \n\nOxea GmbH \n\nBelle Chemical Company \n\nmethanol \n\nammonia \n\nacetone \n\nethanol \n\nbutanol \n\nagrochemicals energy consumables water treatment animal nutrition industrial intermediates Intermediates Oxo alcohols \n\nand derivatives \n\nAcetic acid and \n\nderivatives \n\nAcetic anhydride \n\nEthylene \n\nGlycol ethers \n\nEsters \n\nOlefin derivatives, acetyl derivatives, ethylene, commodity solvents \n\nLyondell Bassell, \n\nBASF SE \n\nDow Inc. \n\nOxea \n\nCelanese Corporation \n\nLonza \n\nIneos Group Holdings \n\nS.A \n\npropane \n\nethane \n\npropylene \n\ncoal \n\nnatural gas \n\nparaxylene \n\nmetaxylene \n\nindustrial chemicals and processing \n\nbuilding and construction (paint and coating applications, construction chemicals, building materials) \n\npharmaceuticals and agriculture \n\nhealth and wellness \n\npackaging \n\nPlasticizers Eastman 168 &#8482; \n\nDioctyl \n\nphthalate \n\n&#160;(\"DOP\") \n\nBenzoflex &#8482; \n\nTXIB &#8482; \n\nEffusion &#8482; \n\nprimary non- \n\nphthalate and \n\nphthalate \n\nplasticizers \n\nand a range of \n\nniche non- \n\nphthalate \n\nplasticizers \n\nBASF SE \n\nExxon Mobil Corporation \n\nLG Chem, Ltd. \n\nLanxess AG \n\npropane \n\npropylene \n\nparaxylene \n\nbuilding and construction (non-phthalate plasticizers used in interior surfaces) consumables (food packaging, packaging adhesives, and glove applications) health and wellness (medical devices) ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Exhibit 99.01 for CI segment revenue by end-use market. \n\nStrategy \n\nTo maintain and enhance its status as a low-cost producer and optimize earnings, the CI segment continuously focuses on cost control, operational efficiency, and capacity utilization. This includes focusing on products used internally by other operating segments, thereby supporting growth in specialty product lines throughout the Company, and also external licensing opportunities. Through the CI segment, the Company has leveraged the advantage of its highly integrated manufacturing facilities. Scale and feedstock versatility at the Kingsport, Tennessee manufacturing facility allows for competitive advantage in the production of acetic anhydride and other acetyl derivatives. At the Longview, Texas manufacturing site, Eastman uses its proprietary oxo technology in one of the world's largest single-site oxo butyraldehyde manufacturing facilities to produce a wide range of alcohols and other derivative products utilizing local propane and ethane supplies and purchased propylene. The Pace, Florida manufacturing facility, which uses ammonia and methanol feedstocks, is one of the world's largest methylamine production sites in the world. These integrated facilities, combined with large scale production processes and a continuous focus on additional process improvements, allow the CI segment product lines to remain cost competitive and, for some products, cost-advantaged as compared to competitors. Use of refinery-grade propylene (\"RGP\") in the feedstock mix of the olefin cracking units at the Longview, Texas manufacturing site reduces the amount of other purchased feedstocks. This results in a decrease in ethylene production and excess ethylene sales while maintaining historical levels of propylene production, providing flexibility to reduce participation in the merchant ethylene market, and retaining a cost-advantaged integrated propylene position to support specialty derivatives throughout the Company. \n\nFIBERS SEGMENT \n\nOverview \n\nIn the Fibers segment, Eastman manufactures and sells acetate tow and triacetin plasticizers for use in filtration media, primarily cigarette filters; cellulosic staple fibers and filament yarn for use in apparel, home furnishings, and industrial fabrics; nonwoven media for use in filtration and friction applications, used primarily in transportation, industrial, and agricultural end-markets; and cellulose acetate flake and acetyl raw materials for other acetate fiber producers. The Company is the world's largest producer of acetate yarn and has been in this business for over 85 years. \n\nThe Fibers segment's competitive strengths include a reputation for high-quality products, technical expertise, large scale vertically-integrated processes, reliability of supply, internally produced acetate flake supply for Fibers segment's products, a reputation for customer service excellence, and a customer base characterized by strategic long-term customers and end-user relationships. The Company continues to capitalize and build on these strengths to further improve the strategic position of its Fibers segment. To strengthen and stabilize segment earnings, the Company has taken actions such as the establishment of long-term variable pricing in acetate tow customer arrangements and agreements, development of innovative textile and nonwoven applications, and repurposing manufacturing capacity from acetate tow to new products. \n\nThe 10 largest Fibers segment customers accounted for approximately 60 percent of the segment's 2022 sales revenue, and include multinational as well as regional cigarette producers, fabric manufacturers, and other acetate fiber producers. \n\nThe Company's long history and experience in fibers markets are reflected in the Fibers segment's operating expertise, both within the Company and in support of its customers' processes. The Fibers segment's knowledge of the industry and of customers' processes allows it to assist its customers in maximizing their processing efficiencies, promoting repeat sales, and developing mutually beneficial, long-term customer relationships. \n\nThe Company's fully integrated fibers manufacturing process employs unique technology that allows it to use a broad range of high-purity wood pulps for which the Company has dependable sources of supply. \n\nPrincipal Products ##TABLE_START Product Description Principal Competitors Key Raw Materials End-Use Applications Acetate Tow \n\nEstron &#8482; \n\ncellulose acetate tow Celanese Corporation \n\nCerdia International \n\nDaicel Corporation \n\nwood pulp \n\nmethanol \n\nhigh sulfur coal \n\nfiltration media (primarily cigarette filters) Acetate Yarn and Fiber Naia &#8482; \n\nEstron &#8482; \n\nnatural (undyed) acetate yarn \n\nsolution dyed acetate yarn \n\nstaple fiber \n\nUAB Dirbtinis Pluostas \n\nLenzing AG \n\nAditya Birla Group \n\nwood pulp \n\nmethanol \n\nhigh sulfur coal \n\nwaste plastics and textiles \n\nconsumables (apparel, home furnishings, and industrial fabrics) \n\nhealth and wellness (medical tape) \n\nAcetyl Chemical Products \n\nEstrobond &#8482; \n\ntriacetin \n\ncellulose acetate flake \n\nacetic acid \n\nacetic anhydride \n\nJiangsu Ruijia Chemistry Co., Ltd. \n\nPolynt SpA \n\nDaicel Corporation \n\nCelanese Corporation \n\nCerdia International \n\nwood pulp \n\nmethanol \n\nhigh sulfur coal \n\nfiltration media (primarily cigarette filters) Nonwovens Nonwovens wetlaid nonwoven media \n\nspecialty and engineered papers \n\ncellulose acetate fiber \n\nHollingsworth and Vose Company \n\nLydall, Inc. \n\nBorgWarner Inc. \n\nnatural and synthetic fibers \n\ninorganic and metallic additives \n\nresins \n\nfiltration and friction media for transportation \n\nindustrial \n\nagriculture and mining \n\naerospace markets \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nStrategy \n\nManagement applies the innovation-driven growth model to the Fibers segment by leveraging its strong customer relationships and industry knowledge to maintain a leading industry position in the global market. The segment benefits from a state-of-the-art, world class, acetate flake production facility at the Kingsport, Tennessee site, which is supplied from Eastman's vertically integrated coal gasification facility and is the largest and most integrated acetate tow site in the world. The Fibers segment also expects to benefit from Eastman's recently developed carbon renewal technology, which enables the substitution of fossil fuel feedstock with recycled waste content. Products using this technology are marketed and sold under the \"Renew\" product designation. See \"Corporate Overview - Business Strategy - Sustainability and Circular Economy \". The Company supplies 100 percent of the acetate flake raw material to the manufacturing facility of its acetate tow joint venture in China from the Company's manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tennessee, which the Company recognizes in sales revenue. The Company recognizes earnings in the joint venture through its equity investment, reported in \"Other (income) charges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Company's focus on innovation has resulted in repurposing some of its acetate tow manufacturing capacity to fibers products for textiles, resulting in increased capacity utilization and lower acetate tow costs. \n\nTo meet customers' evolving needs and further improve the Fibers segment's manufacturing process efficiencies, the Company makes use of its capabilities in fibers technology to maintain a strong focus on incremental product and process improvements. \n\nIn 2022, the Fibers segment: \n\n&#8226; implemented variable pricing agreements across the acetate tow customer base, driving growth and returning adjusted EBIT margins and cash flow generation to acceptable performance levels; \n\n&#8226; commercialized Naia &#8482; staple fiber for spun yarns for apparel and home textiles; and \n\n&#8226; announced several high-profile brand adoptions, including a major multinational clothing company; an American retailer of outdoor clothing; and a sustainable women's clothing and accessories designer and manufacturer. \n\nThe Fibers segment R&#38;D efforts focus on serving new and existing customers, leveraging proprietary cellulosic biopolymers and spinning technology, optimizing asset productivity through process improvement, selective product innovation in response to acetate tow customer needs, and working with suppliers to reduce costs. For textiles, the Fibers segment is offsetting declines in acetate tow through investments in differentiated application development capabilities and new product innovations, including circular solutions, to drive growth in textiles and apparel of Naia &#8482; yarns and fibers. \n\n##TABLE_START EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY GENERAL INFORMATION ##TABLE_END\n\nSeasonality \n\nEastman's earnings are typically higher in the second and third quarters, and cash flows from operations are typically highest in the second half of the year due to seasonal demand based on general economic activity in the Company's key markets as described in \"Business Segments\". Results in all segments except the Fibers segment are typically weaker in the fourth quarter due to seasonal downturns in key markets. \n\nThe coatings additives product line of the AFP segment and the intermediates product line of the CI segment are impacted by the cyclicality of key end products and markets, while other operating segments and product lines are more sensitive to global economic conditions. Eastman is exposed to consumer discretionary end-markets and changes in global consumer spending, particularly in the AM and AFP segments. Supply and demand dynamics determine profitability at different stages of business cycles and global economic conditions affect the length of each cycle. \n\nSales, Marketing, and Distribution \n\nEastman markets and sells products primarily through a global marketing and sales organization which has a presence in the United States and approximately 30 other countries selling into more than 100 countries around the world. The Company focuses its market engagement on attractive niche markets, leveraging disruptive macro trends, and market activation throughout the value chain with both customers and downstream users. Eastman's strategy is to target industries and markets where the Company can leverage its application development expertise to develop product offerings to provide differentiated value that address current and future customer and market needs. The Company's strategic marketing approach and capabilities leverage the Company's insights about trends, markets, and customers to drive development of specialty products. Through a highly skilled and specialized sales force that is capable of providing differentiated product solutions, Eastman strives to be the preferred supplier in the Company's targeted markets. \n\nThe Company's products are also marketed through indirect channels, which include dealers and contract representatives. Sales outside the United States tend to be made more frequently through dealers and contract representatives than sales in the United States. The combination of direct and indirect sales channels, including sales online through its Customer Center website, allows Eastman to reliably serve customers throughout the world. \n\nThe Company's products are shipped to customers and to downstream users directly from Eastman manufacturing plants and distribution centers worldwide. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nManagement applies its innovation-driven growth model to leverage the Company's world class scalable technology platforms that provide a competitive advantage and the foundation for sustainable earnings growth. The Company's R&#38;D strategy for sustainable growth through innovation includes multi-generational product development for specialty products, faster and more differentiated product development by leveraging global application development capabilities, and the creation of value through integration of multiple technology platforms. The Company's innovation strategy is guided by the need to provide practical solutions to sustainability macro-drivers that will improve the quality of life globally through material solutions. This strategy has been accelerated by enhancements of global differentiated application development capabilities that position Eastman as a strategic element of customers' success within attractive niche markets. See examples of recent product and technology innovations in \"Corporate Overview - Business Strategy - Innovation\". \n\nEastman manages certain growth initiatives and costs at the corporate level, including certain R&#38;D costs not allocated to any one operating segment. The Company uses a stage-gating process, which is a disciplined decision-making framework for evaluating targeted opportunities, with a number of projects at various stages of development. As projects meet milestones, additional amounts are spent on those projects. The Company continues to explore and invest in R&#38;D initiatives such as high-performance materials and opportunities created by disruptive macro trends including sustainability and development of a more \"circular economy\". See \"Corporate Overview - Business Strategy - Sustainability and Circular Economy \". \n\nManufacturing Streams \n\nIntegral to Eastman's strategy for growth is leveraging its heritage expertise and innovation in polyester, cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl, alkylamine, and olefins chemistries in key markets, including transportation, building and construction, consumables, and agriculture. For each of these chemistries, Eastman has developed and acquired a combination of assets and technologies that are operated within four manufacturing \"streams\", combining scale and integration across multiple manufacturing units and sites as a competitive advantage. \n\n&#8226; In the polyester stream, the Company begins with paraxylene, ethylene glycol, and integrated feedstocks, converting them through a series of intermediate materials to ultimately produce clear, tough, chemically resistant copolyesters. The Company is enhancing the polyester stream by investing in the multiple plastic-to-plastic polyester renewal facilities to enable various waste plastics to be recycled into high quality, specialty copolyester Renew products. Polyester stream products are converted for end-uses in cosmetics and personal care, medical device, durable goods, and food packaging industries. \n\n&#8226; In the cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl stream, the Company begins with gasification of fossil fuels with oxygen. The resulting synthesis gas is converted into acetic acid and acetic anhydride. Cellulosic biopolymers derivative manufacturing at the Company begins with natural polymers, sourced from sustainably-managed forests, which, when combined with acetyl and olefin chemicals, provide differentiated product lines. Through a new recycling innovation, carbon renewal technology is now enabling the recycling of complex plastics to the basic building blocks of Eastman's cellulosic product stream. The major end-markets for products from the cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl stream include coatings, displays, and thermoplastics. \n\n&#8226; In the alkylamines stream, the Company begins with ammonia and alcohol feedstocks to produce methylamines and higher alkylamines, which can then be further converted into alkylamine derivatives. The Company's alkylamines products are primarily used in agriculture, water treatment, consumables, animal nutrition, and oil and gas end-markets. \n\n&#8226; In the olefins stream, the Company begins primarily with propane and ethane, which are thermally \"cracked\" (the process whereby hydrocarbon molecules are broken down and rearranged) into ethylene and propylene in cracking units at its site in Longview, Texas. As a result of modifications completed in 2018, these units also offer flexibility to use refinery-grade propylene (\"RGP\") as a diversified feedstock to minimize the impact of olefins spread volatility. The Company purchases some additional propylene to supplement cracking unit production. Propylene derivative products are used in a variety of items such as paints and coatings, automotive safety glass, and non-phthalate plasticizers. Ethylene derivative products are converted for end-uses in the food industry, health and beauty products, detergents, and automotive products. \n\nThe Company leverages its expertise and innovation in cellulosic biopolymers and acetyl, olefins, polyester, and alkylamine chemistries and technologies to meet demand and create new uses and opportunities for the Company's products in key markets. Through integration and optimization across these streams, the Company is able to create unique and differentiated products that have a performance advantage over competitive materials. \n\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials and Energy \n\nEastman purchases a majority of its key raw materials and energy through different contract mechanisms, generally of one to three years in initial duration with renewal or cancellation options for each party. Most of these agreements do not require the Company to purchase materials or energy if its operations are reduced or idle. The cost of raw materials and energy is generally based on market price at the time of purchase; however, from time to time Eastman uses derivative financial instruments for certain key raw materials to mitigate the impact of market price fluctuations. Key raw materials include propane, propylene, paraxylene, methanol, cellulosic biopolymers, fatty alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol, and a wide variety of precursors for specialty organic chemicals. Key purchased energy sources include natural gas, coal, and electricity. The Company has multiple suppliers for most key raw materials and energy and uses quality management principles, such as the establishment of long-term relationships with suppliers and ongoing performance assessments and benchmarking, as part of its supplier selection process. When appropriate, the Company purchases raw materials from a single source supplier to maximize quality and reduce cost and has contingency plans to minimize the potential impact of any supply disruptions from single source suppliers. \n\nWhile temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur, these items are generally sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements. However, their continuous availability and cost are subject to unscheduled plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, domestic and world market conditions, changes in government regulation, supply chain disruption, the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic (\"COVID-19\"), natural disasters, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure. Eastman's operations or products have been in the past, and may be in the future, adversely affected by these factors. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report. The Company's raw material and energy costs as a percent of total cost of operations were approximately 55 percent in 2022. For additional information about raw materials, see Exhibit 99.02 \"Product and Raw Material Information\" of this Annual Report. \n\nIntellectual Property, Trademarks, and Licensing \n\nWhile Eastman's intellectual property portfolio is an important Company asset which it expands and vigorously protects globally through a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, neither its business as a whole nor any particular operating segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret. As a producer of a broad range of advanced materials, specialty additives, chemicals, and fibers, Eastman owns over 800 active United States patents and over 1,400 active foreign patents, expiring at various times over several years, and owns over 4,800 active worldwide trademark applications and registrations. As the laws of many countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, Eastman cannot ensure that it will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property assets outside the United States. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report. \n\nThe Company pursues opportunities to license proprietary technology to third parties where it has determined that the competitive impact to its businesses will be minimal. These arrangements typically are structured to require payments at significant project milestones such as signing, completion of design, and start-up. \n\nInformation Security \n\nThe Company employs information systems to support its business, enable transformation and deploy digital services. The Company utilizes a risk-based, multi-layered information security approach following the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, including (a) dedicated security operations center monitoring, (b) network-based and host-based protections, (c) a Privacy Council focused upon adherence to privacy regulations, (d) privilege access management controls, (e) annual and on-going information security training and targeted exercises, (f) encryption of data, backup, recovery, and testing, (g) regular internal and external audits against information security best practices, and (h) benchmarking utilizing external third parties. As with other industry participants, the Company from time to time experiences attempted cyber-attacks of its information systems. None of these attempts have resulted in a material adverse impact on the Company's operations or financial results, any penalties, or settlements. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report. \n\nSenior management, including the Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\"), reviews information security performance and recent cybersecurity industry trends at least quarterly, and at least annually reviews the Company's information security strategy with executive management. \n\nUnder the Company's enterprise-wide approach to risk management, cyber security and security of company information is a \"high-priority\" risk that is reported to and overseen by the Board of Directors. The CIO provides an overview of information security performance and recent cybersecurity industry trends to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis throughout the year. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nTo keep solving complex problems and growing its business, the Company must continue to attract, develop, and retain exceptional people (\"human capital\"), and motivate them to excel. Strong workforce and leadership development, succession management, an inclusive culture that brings out the best in every individual and competitive compensation and benefits are vital to the success of Eastman's innovation-driven growth strategy. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors oversees workforce and senior management development and the Board of Directors monitors the culture of the Company and leadership quality, morale, and development. \n\nEastman places a strong emphasis on the health, safety and well-being of employees &#8212; both at work and at home. Eastman's \"zero-incident mindset\" takes a holistic approach to people and processes by fostering the right behaviors, values, and culture to ensure that employees are operating responsibly, accountably, and safely. In addition to annual process and personal safety performance expectations (see \"Executive Compensation\" in Part III, Item 11 of this Annual Report), safety and wellness protocols continue to be included for protection against the COVID-19 virus for employees. \n\nThe Company's focus on well-being also includes physical, emotional, and financial health of employees and their families, with on-site and on-demand resources such as fitness classes, health coaches, and financial counselors. In 2022, the Company conducted a benefits equity study to better understand the needs of its employees in the current environment. Through this work, the Company continues to explore new ways to make benefits more equitable and inclusive and more attractive in a diverse talent marketplace. The Company also continues to provide global flexibility principles and resources to emphasize the importance of balancing work and personal responsibilities. \n\nBreakthroughs require creativity and unconventional ideas, and that takes diverse perspectives and an environment that empowers everyone to speak their mind and add value, so their ideas can get translated into plans and actions. As Eastman develops new products to meet today's most pressing needs, the Company inspires innovative ideas by making every team member feel valued and empowered to do their best work. Eastman's capacity to innovate and transform depends on its ability to attract and retain the best and brightest talent. Building an inclusive workplace, powered by a diverse global employee population of approximately 14,500 people worldwide is key to promoting innovation and driving results. \n\nThe table below shows the percentage of the Company's global employee population by region. \n\n##TABLE_START United States and Canada 72 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 15 % Asia Pacific 10 % Latin America 3 % Total 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nEastman's focus on inclusion and diversity transcends race and gender. To execute the growth strategy, the Company needs to attract, develop, and retain people of all backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. Eastman believes transparency is an important part of creating accountability and driving progress. To that end, the Company has set clear goals to achieve gender parity in professional and leadership roles globally and to be an industry leader in racial and ethnic diversity in the United States by 2030. In 2022, the Company's female representation globally was 39 percent in professional level roles, 28 percent in leadership roles, and 25 percent at the executive level. In the United States, the Company's racially and ethnically diverse talent was 14 percent at both professional and leadership levels, and 13 percent at the executive level. The non-employee directors of Eastman's Board of Directors are 30 percent female and 20 percent racially and ethnically diverse. See \"Information About our Executive Officers\" in Part I of this Annual Report and \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\"&#8212; \"Election of Directors\" in Part III, Item 10 of this Annual Report for more information. \n\nEastman Resource Groups (\"ERGs\") are uniquely positioned to bring the Company's Inclusion &#38; Diversity strategy to life through their insights and access to key populations to make sure every team member feels valued, respected, and able to perform at their full potential. Chaired by a team member and sponsored by a senior executive, each ERG is dedicated to helping its members bridge cultural gaps, grow professionally and maximize business contributions. All Eastman team members are encouraged to join or participate in any or multiple ERGs, either as a member of the target community or as an ally. \n\nEastman's compensation philosophy, principles and processes are designed to ensure the Company pays competitively in the market for top talent and that the pay is distributed fairly and consistently. An independent third party assesses pay equity each year by comparing pay for people in the same jobs, job levels, and locations. This analysis, which considers gender, race and ethnicity (in the U.S.), performance, tenure, specialty skills, and educational credentials, is completed during the annual compensation review process, when leadership makes pay decisions. \n\nCustomers \n\nEastman has an extensive customer base and, while it is not dependent on any one customer, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the Company until such business is replaced. The top 100 customers accounted for approximately 55 percent of the Company's 2022 sales revenue. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Company's consolidated sales revenue during 2022. \n\nCompliance With Environmental and Other Government Regulations \n\nThe Company is subject to significant and complex governmental laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance and may, depending on specific facts and circumstances, impact the Company's competitive position. (See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors -- Legislative, regulatory, or voluntary actions, including associated with physical impacts of climate change, could increase the Company's future health, safety, and environmental compliance costs.\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.) These include health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations; site security regulations; chemical control laws; laws protecting intellectual property; privacy, data sharing and data protection laws; laws regulating energy generation and distribution, such as utilities, pipelines and co-generation facilities; and customs laws and laws regulating import and export of products and technology. As described below, the most significant environmental capital and other expenditures are for compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. In addition to these regulations, compliance with chemical control laws (including the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act, the U.S. Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and similar non-U.S. counterparts, and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\"REACH\") program in the European Union) and laws protecting intellectual property (see \"Intellectual Property, Trademarks, and Licensing\") have the most impact on the Company's day-to-day operations and competitive position. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nThe Company is subject to laws, regulations, and legal requirements relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal, remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which it does business. These health, safety, and environmental considerations are a priority in the Company's planning for all existing and new products and processes. The Environmental, Safety, and Sustainability Committee of Eastman's Board of Directors oversees the Company's policies and practices concerning health, safety, and the environment and its processes for complying with related laws and regulations and monitors related matters. \n\nThe Company's policy is to operate its plants and facilities in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations such that it protects the environment and the health and safety of its employees and the public. The Company intends to continue to make expenditures for environmental protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with its policies and with available technology. In some cases, applicable environmental regulations such as those adopted under the Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and related actions of regulatory agencies determine the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by the Company. Likewise, any new legislation or regulations related to GHG gas emissions, energy or climate change, or the repeal of such legislation or regulations, could impact the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by the Company. \n\nThe Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In some instances, the amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to insufficient information, particularly as to the nature and timing of future expenditures. In these cases, the liability is monitored until such time that sufficient information exists. With respect to a contaminated site, the amount accrued reflects liabilities expected to be paid out within approximately 30 years as well as the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. \n\nThe Company does not currently expect near term environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially impact the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Other matters concerning health, safety, and the environment are discussed in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 and in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\"; Note 13, \"Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\"; and Note 21, \"Reserve Rollforwards\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nEastman's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $300 million, $281 million, and $265 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and include operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, engineering costs, and construction costs. These cash expenditures include environmental capital expenditures of approximately $60 million, $38 million, and $42 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nEastman places a strong emphasis on the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Eastman's commitment to a \"zero-incident mindset\" takes a holistic approach to people and processes by fostering the right behaviors, values, and culture to ensure that its employees are operating responsibly, accountably, and safely. See \"Human Capital\". Under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"), some of the Company's operations are subject to workplace standards under OSHA's Process Safety Management program. From time to time, the Company may incur significant capital expenditures to maintain compliance with the requirements of this program. \n\nAvailable Information - Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Filings \n\nEastman makes available free of charge, in the Investors section of its Internet website at www.eastman.com, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with, or furnishing it to, the SEC.

      "text": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS \n\nGeneral \n\nFrom time to time, Eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Consistent with the requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K, Item 103, the Company's threshold for disclosing any environmental legal proceeding involving a governmental authority (including the Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania proceedings described below) is potential monetary sanctions that management believes will exceed $1 million. \n\nJefferson Hills, Pennsylvania Environmental Proceeding \n\nIn September 2021, Eastman Chemical Resins, Inc. (\"ECRI\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company received a proposed Consent Decree from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Region 3 Office (\"EPA\") and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (\"PADEP\") alleging that ECRI's Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania manufacturing operation had violated certain federal and state environmental regulations. Even though the Company sold the Jefferson Hills facility on April 1, 2022 as part of its previously reported sale of the adhesives resins business, it retained responsibility for any civil penalty assessed by EPA and PADEP in this matter. Following receipt of the proposed Consent Decree, ECRI and Company representatives met on multiple occasions with EPA and PADEP representatives and vigorously defended against these allegations. The parties have now reached a tentative settlement of this matter. The ultimate resolution of this proceeding is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nSolutia Legacy Torts Claims Litigation \n\nPursuant to an Amended and Restated Settlement Agreement effective February 28, 2008 between Solutia, Inc. (\"Solutia\") and Monsanto Company (\"Monsanto\") in connection with Solutia's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings (the \"Monsanto Settlement Agreement\"), Monsanto is responsible for the defense and indemnification of Solutia against any Legacy Tort Claims (as defined in the Monsanto Settlement Agreement) and Solutia has agreed to retain responsibility for certain tort claims, if any, that may arise from Solutia's conduct after its spinoff from Pharmacia Corporation (f/k/a Monsanto), which occurred on September 1, 1997. Solutia, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastman upon Eastman's acquisition of Solutia in July 2012, has been named as a defendant in several such proceedings, and has submitted the matters to Monsanto, which was acquired by Bayer AG in June 2018, as Legacy Tort Claims. To the extent these matters are not within the meaning of Legacy Tort Claims, Solutia could potentially be liable thereunder. In connection with the completion of its acquisition of Solutia, Eastman guaranteed the obligations of Solutia and Eastman was added as an indemnified party under the Monsanto Settlement Agreement. \n\n"

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \n\n(a) Eastman's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") under the symbol \"EMN\". \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 118,796,867 shares of Eastman's common stock issued and outstanding, which shares were held by 11,486 stockholders of record. These shares include 50,798 shares held by the Company's charitable foundation. \n\nSee \"Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters -Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\" in Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report for the information required by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K. \n\n(b) Not applicable. \n\n(c) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers. \n\nIn February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders (the \"2018 authorization\"). The Company completed the 2018 authorization in May 2022, acquiring a total of 19,915,370 shares. In December 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders (the \"2021 authorization\"). As of December 31, 2022, a total of 6,743,883 shares have been repurchased under the 2021 authorization for $635 million. Both dividends and share repurchases are key strategies employed by the Company to return value to its stockholders. \n\nIn fourth quarter 2021, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (\"2021 ASR\") to purchase $500 million of the Company's common stock under the 2018 authorization. In exchange for upfront payment totaling $500 million, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the 2021 ASR's purchase period, which was settled in first quarter 2022. The total number of shares ultimately delivered was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock during the term of the 2021 ASR, less a discount.

In exchange for upfront payment totaling $500 million, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the 2022 ASR's purchase period, which was settled in third quarter 2022. The total number of shares ultimately delivered was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock during the term of the 2022 ASR, less a discount. Approximately 80 percent of the expected shares repurchased under the 2022 ASR were delivered in second quarter 2022 and the remaining shares were delivered in third quarter 2022. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company repurchased 10,710,259 shares of common stock for $1,102 million, which included $100 million from the settlement of the 2021 ASR. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 15, \"Stockholders' Equity\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n##TABLE_START Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share (1) \n\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plan or Program Approximate Dollar Value that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plan or Program October 1-31, 2022 &#8212; $ &#8212; &#8212; $ 1.965 billion November 1-30, 2022 611,452 $ 82.68 611,452 $ 1.915 billion December 1-31, 2022 592,863 $ 84.33 592,863 $ 1.865 billion Total 1,204,315 $ 83.56 1,204,315 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Average price paid per share reflects the weighted average purchase price paid for shares. \n\n"

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n##TABLE_START Page \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nOverview \n\nResults of Operations \n\nSummary by Operating Segment \n\nSales by Customer Location \n\nLiquidity and Other Financial Information \n\nInflation \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards \n\nRisk Factors \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&#38;A\") is based upon the consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company (\"Eastman\" or the \"Company\"), which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted (\"GAAP\") in the United States, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \"Annual Report\"). All references to earnings per share (\"EPS\") contained in this report are to diluted EPS unless otherwise noted. EBIT is the GAAP measure earnings before interest and taxes. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, please read \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item. 7 of Eastman's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, fair value of disposal groups, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Eastman evaluates its estimates, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets, environmental costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company's financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nDefinite-lived Assets \n\nProperties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by Eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review of properties and equipment and the review of definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. The Company's assumptions to estimate cash flows in the evaluation of impairment related to long-lived assets are subject to change and impairments may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are decreased, the carrying amount of the related asset is reduced, resulting in a charge to earnings. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill is an asset determined as the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets and liabilities \n\nacquired in a business combination. Eastman conducts testing of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The testing of goodwill is performed at the \"reporting unit\" level which the Company has determined to be its \"components\". Components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a \"business\" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by Company operating segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. \n\nAn impairment is recognized when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. The Company uses an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model, in testing the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit for impairment. Key assumptions and estimates used in the Company's 2022 goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues and EBIT determined using the Company's annual multi-year strategic plan, the estimated weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\"), and a projected long-term growth rate. The Company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made. However, actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the Company's estimates. In addition, the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different estimated fair values of reporting units. The WACC is calculated incorporating weighted average returns on debt and equity from market participants. Therefore, changes in the market, which are beyond the control of the Company, may have an impact on future estimates of fair value. \n\nThe Company had $3.7 billion of goodwill as of December 31, 2022. As a result of the goodwill impairment testing performed during fourth quarter 2022, fair values were determined to exceed the carrying values for each reporting unit tested. Declines in market conditions or forecasted revenue and EBIT could result in a future impairment of goodwill. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. The Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment, and it was determined that it is more likely than not the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets was greater than their carrying value. When a quantitative impairment assessment is performed, the Company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment. The estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on projections of revenue and an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant WACC plus a risk premium. The Company had $359 million in indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2022. There was no impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the tests performed during fourth quarter 2022. Declines in market conditions or forecasted revenue could result in impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets. \n\nThe Company will continue to monitor both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for any indication of events which might require additional testing before the next annual impairment test and could result in material impairment charges. \n\nFor additional information related to impairment of long-lived assets, see Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\", Note 4, \"Properties and Accumulated Depreciation\", Note 5, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\", and Note 16, \"Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nEnvironmental Costs \n\nEastman recognizes environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company recognizes the minimum undiscounted amount. This undiscounted amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years and the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $245 million to the maximum of $457 million at December 31, 2022. The best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable and include the amounts recognized at December 31, 2022. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 13, \"Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\nEastman maintains defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. The estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits primarily reflect the Company's assumptions related to discount rates and expected return on plan assets. For the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the Company assumed weighted average discount rates of 5.58 percent and 4.27 percent, respectively, and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 6.62 percent and 3.86 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2022. The Company assumed a weighted average discount rate of 5.55 percent for its other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2022. The estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 and expense for 2023 are affected by year-end 2022 assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Company's long-term assumptions in the assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. ##TABLE_START Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Pre-tax Benefits Expense (Excludes mark-to-market impact) for Pension Plans Impact on December 31, 2022 Projected Benefit Obligation for Pension Plans Impact on 2023 Pre-tax Benefits Expense (Excludes mark-to-market impact) for Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Impact on December 31, 2022 Benefit Obligation for Other Postretirement Benefit Plans U.S. Non-U.S. 25 basis point decrease in discount rate $-1 Million $+32 Million $+22 Million $-1 Million $+10 Million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $+1 Million $-31 Million $-20 Million $+1 Million $-10 Million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets $+4 Million No Impact No Impact &#60;+$0.5 Million No Impact 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets $-4 Million No Impact No Impact &#60;-$0.5 Million No Impact ##TABLE_END\n\nThe assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to calculate the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are established each December 31. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Because future health care benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on results of operations. The expected return on plan assets is based upon prior performance and the long-term expected returns in the markets in which the plans invest their funds, primarily in U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income securities, U.S. and non-U.S. public equity securities, private equity, and real estate. Moreover, the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption and on average is expected to approximate the actual return on plan assets. Actual returns will be subject to year-to-year variances and could vary materially from assumptions. \n\nThe Company calculates service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. This cost approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation or the annual net periodic benefit cost or credit of the plans because the change in the service and interest costs will be offset in the mark-to-market (\"MTM\") actuarial gain or loss. The MTM gain or loss, as described in the next paragraph, is typically recognized in the fourth quarter of each year or in any other quarters in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. \n\nThe Company uses fair value accounting for plan assets. If actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, primarily discount rates and long-term assumptions for asset returns which were used in determining the current year expense, the difference is recognized as part of the MTM net gain or loss in fourth quarter each year, and any other quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. See the calculation of the MTM pension and other post-retirement benefits (gain) loss table below in \"NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES - Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Non-Core and Unusual Items Excluded from Earnings\". \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nWhile changes in obligations do not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirements, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. \n\nFor further information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 11, \"Retirement Plans\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nAmounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities on Eastman's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income and domestic and foreign taxes, using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning opportunities. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from management estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and statements of financial position. As of December 31, 2022, valuation allowances of $258 million have been provided against the deferred tax assets. \n\nThe calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and management judgment. Eastman's income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments which could result in additional income tax liabilities and income tax expense. Income tax expense could be materially impacted to the extent the Company prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, or to the extent payments are required in excess of the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nFor further information, see Note 8, \"Income Taxes\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures, and the accompanying reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, are presented below in this section and in \"Overview\", \"Results of Operations\", \"Summary by Operating Segment\", and \"Liquidity and Other Financial Information - Cash Flows\" in this MD&#38;A. \n\nManagement discloses non-GAAP financial measures, and the related reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess the Company's and its operating segments' performances, make resource allocation decisions, and evaluate organizational and individual performances in determining certain performance-based compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have definitions under GAAP, and may be defined differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on any non-GAAP financial measure, but to consider such measures alongside the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nCompany Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nNon-Core Items and any Unusual or Non-Recurring Items Excluded from Non-GAAP Earnings \n\nIn addition to evaluating Eastman's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows as reported in accordance with GAAP, management evaluates Company and operating segment performance, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions, excluding the effect of transactions, costs, and losses or gains that do not directly result from Eastman's normal, or \"core\", business and operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. \n\n&#8226; Non-core transactions, costs, and losses or gains relate to, among other things, cost reductions, growth and profitability improvement initiatives, changes in businesses and assets, and other events outside of core business operations, and have included asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, costs of and related to acquisitions, gains and losses from and costs related to dispositions, closure, or shutdowns of businesses or assets, financing transaction costs, environmental costs related to previously divested businesses or non-operational sites and product lines, and mark-to-market losses or gains for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. \n\n&#8226; In 2022, the Company recognized unusual costs, net of insurance proceeds, from the previously reported January 31, 2022 operational incident at its Kingsport site as a result of a steam line failure (the \"steam line incident\"). Management considered the operational incident unusual because of the Company's operational and safety history and the magnitude of the unplanned disruption. \n\n&#8226; In 2021, the Company decreased the provision for income taxes due to adjustment of the amount recognized in prior years resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform Act\"). As with the prior years' item to which this relates, management considers this decrease unusual because of the infrequent nature of the underlying change in tax law and resulting impacts on earnings. \n\nBecause non-core, unusual, or non-recurring transactions, costs, and losses or gains may materially affect the Company's, or any particular operating segment's, financial condition or results in a specific period in which they are recognized, management believes it is appropriate to evaluate the financial measures prepared and calculated in accordance with both GAAP and the related non-GAAP financial measures excluding the effect on the Company's results of these non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. In addition to using such measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management evaluates such non-GAAP measures, and believes that investors may also evaluate such measures, because such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's, and its segments', operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and, as a result, provide a better indication of expected future trends. \n\nAdjusted Tax Rate and Provision for Income Taxes \n\nIn interim periods, Eastman discloses non-GAAP earnings with an adjusted effective tax rate and a resulting adjusted provision for income taxes using the Company's forecasted tax rate for the full year as of the end of the interim period. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes are equal to the Company's projected full year effective tax rate and provision for income taxes on earnings excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items for completed periods. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes may fluctuate during the year for changes in events and circumstances that change the Company's forecasted annual effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. Management discloses this adjusted effective tax rate, and the related reconciliation to the GAAP effective tax rate, to provide investors more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's operational performance on a period-over-period interim basis and on the same basis as management evaluates quarterly financial results to provide a better indication of expected full year results. \n\nNon-GAAP Debt Measure \n\nEastman from time to time evaluates and discloses to investors and securities and credit analysts the non-GAAP debt measure \"net debt\", which management defines as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities and credit analysts to provide them with information similar to that used by management in evaluating the Company's overall financial position, liquidity, and leverage and because management believes investors, securities analysts, credit analysts and rating agencies, and lenders often use a similar measure to assess and compare companies' relative financial position and liquidity. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nNon-GAAP Measures in this Annual Report \n\nThe following non-core items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Annual Report: \n\n&#8226; Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net; \n\n&#8226; Mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefit plans gains and losses resulting from the changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets during the period; \n\n&#8226; Environmental and other costs from previously divested or non-operational sites and product lines; \n\n&#8226; Gains and losses, net on divested businesses and related transaction costs; \n\n&#8226; Adjustments to contingent considerations; \n\n&#8226; Accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility as part of site optimization; and \n\n&#8226; Early debt extinguishment costs. \n\nThe following unusual items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Annual Report: \n\n&#8226; Steam line incident costs, net of insurance proceeds, and \n\n&#8226; Decrease to the provision for income taxes due to adjustment of the amount recognized in prior years as a result of the Tax Reform Act. \n\nAs described above, the alternative non-GAAP measure of debt, \"net debt\", is also presented in this Annual Report. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Non-Core and Unusual Items Excluded from Earnings ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Non-core items impacting EBIT: Mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefits loss (gain), net $ 19 $ (267) Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 52 47 Environmental and other costs 15 &#8212; Loss on divested businesses and related transaction costs 61 570 Adjustments to contingent considerations (6) &#8212; Accelerated depreciation &#8212; 4 Unusual item impacting EBIT: Steam line incident costs, net of insurance proceeds 39 &#8212; Total non-core and unusual items impacting EBIT 180 354 Non-core item impacting earnings before income taxes: Early debt extinguishment &#8212; 1 Total non-core item impacting earnings before income taxes &#8212; 1 Less: Items impacting provision for income taxes: Tax effect for non-core and unusual items (11) (16) Adjustments from tax law changes &#8212; 15 Total items impacting provision for income taxes (11) (1) Total items impacting net earnings attributable to Eastman $ 191 $ 356 ##TABLE_END\n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nBelow is the calculation of the \"Other components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net\" that are not included in the above non-core item \"mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefits loss (gain), net\" and that are included in the non-GAAP results. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Other components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net $ (101) $ (412) Service cost 36 45 Net periodic benefit (credit) cost (65) (367) Less: Mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefits loss (gain), net 19 (267) Components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net included in non-GAAP earnings measures $ (84) $ (100) ##TABLE_END\n\nBelow is the calculation of the MTM pension and other post-retirement benefits (gain) loss disclosed above. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Actual return and percentage of return on assets $ (582) (23) % $ 278 10 % Less: expected return on assets 163 6 % 168 6 % Mark-to-market (loss) gain on assets (745) 110 \n\nActuarial gain (1) \n\n719 157 \n\nCurtailment gain (2) \n\n7 &#8212; Total mark-to-market (loss) gain $ (19) $ 267 Global weighted-average assumed discount rate for year ended December 31: 5.27 % 2.52 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Actuarial gain resulted primarily from the change in discount rates from the prior year and changes in other actuarial assumptions. \n\n(2) Curtailment gain in a Non U.S. pension plan was triggered by the sale of the adhesives resins business. The Company retained certain plan participants while the status of the participants changed. The curtailment includes $3 million reduction in the pension benefit obligation and $4 million of prior service credits recognized. \n\nFor more detail about MTM pension and other postretirement benefit plans net gains and losses, including actual and expected return on plan assets and the components of the net gain or loss, see \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\" above, and Note 11, \"Retirement Plans\", \"Summary of Changes - Actuarial (gain) loss, Actual return on plan assets, and Reserve for third party contributions\", and \"Summary of Benefit Costs and Other Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income - Mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefits (gain) loss, net\" to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nThis MD&#38;A includes the effect of the foregoing on the following GAAP financial measures: \n\n&#8226; Gross profit, \n\n&#8226; Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&#38;A\") expenses, \n\n&#8226; Other components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net, \n\n&#8226; Other (income) charges, net, \n\n&#8226; Earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\"), \n\n&#8226; Provision for income taxes, \n\n&#8226; Net earnings attributable to Eastman, \n\n&#8226; Diluted EPS, and \n\n&#8226; Total borrowings. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOther Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nAlternative Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures \n\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report and other periodic reports, management may occasionally evaluate and disclose to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP measure cash provided by or used in operating activities excluding certain non-core, unusual, or non-recurring sources or uses of cash or including cash from or used by activities that are managed as part of core business operations (\"adjusted cash provided by or used in operating activities\") when analyzing, among other things, business performance, liquidity and financial position, and performance-based compensation. Management has used this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the GAAP measure cash provided by or used in operating activities because it believes it is an appropriate metric to evaluate the cash flows from Eastman's core operations that are available for organic and inorganic growth initiatives and because it allows for a more consistent period-over-period presentation of such amounts. In its evaluation, management generally excludes the impact of certain non-core and unusual activities and decisions of management that it considers not core, ongoing components of operations and the decisions to undertake or not to undertake such activities may be made irrespective of the cash generated from operations, and generally includes cash from or used in activities that are managed as operating activities and in business operating decisions. Management has disclosed this non-GAAP measure and the related reconciliation to investors, securities analysts, credit analysts and rating agencies, and lenders to allow them to better understand and evaluate the information used by management in its decision-making processes and because management believes investors and securities analysts use similar measures to assess Company performance, liquidity, and financial position over multiple periods and to compare these with other companies. \n\nFrom time to time, Eastman may evaluate and disclose to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of \"free cash flow\", which management defines as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less the amount of net capital expenditures (typically the GAAP measure additions to properties and equipment). In addition, Eastman may disclose to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of \"free cash flow yield\", which management defines as annual free cash flow divided by the Company's market capitalization, and \"free cash flow conversion\", which management defines as annual free cash flow divided by adjusted net income. Management believes these metrics can be useful to investors and securities analysts in comparing cash flow generation with that of peer and other companies. \n\nAlternative Non-GAAP Earnings Measures \n\nFrom time to time, Eastman may also disclose to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP earnings measures \"Adjusted EBIT Margin\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA Margin\", \"Return on Invested Capital\" (or \"ROIC\"), and \"Adjusted ROIC\". Management defines Adjusted EBIT Margin as the GAAP measure EBIT adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA (net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for the same periods. Management defines ROIC as net earnings plus interest expense after tax divided by average total borrowings plus average stockholders' equity for the periods presented, each derived from the GAAP measures in the Company's financial statements for the periods presented. Adjusted ROIC is ROIC adjusted to exclude from net earnings the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods. Management believes that Adjusted EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, ROIC, and Adjusted ROIC are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of and returns from Eastman's operating businesses, and from time to time uses such measures in internal performance calculations. Further, management understands that investors and securities analysts often use similar measures of Adjusted EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, ROIC, and Adjusted ROIC to compare the results, returns, and value of the Company with those of peer and other companies. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nEastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Advanced Materials (\"AM\"), Additives &#38; Functional Products (\"AFP\"), Chemical Intermediates (\"CI\"), and Fibers. Eastman uses an innovation-driven growth model which consists of leveraging world class scalable technology platforms, delivering differentiated application development capabilities, and relentlessly engaging the market. The Company's world class technology platforms form the foundation of sustainable growth by differentiated products through significant scale advantages in research and development (\"R&#38;D\") and advantaged global market access. Molecular recycling technologies continue to be an area of investment focus for the Company and extends the level of differentiation afforded by its world class technology platforms. Differentiated application development converts market complexity into opportunities for growth and accelerates innovation by enabling a deeper understanding of the value of Eastman's products and how they perform within customers' and end-user products. Key areas of application development include thermoplastic conversion, functional films, coatings formulations, textiles and nonwovens, animal nutrition, and personal and home care formulations. The Company engages the market by working directly with customers and downstream users, targeting attractive niche markets, and leveraging disruptive macro trends. Management believes that these elements of the Company's innovation-driven growth model, combined with disciplined portfolio management and balanced capital deployment, will result in consistent, sustainable earnings growth and strong cash flow from operations. \n\nThe Company generated sales revenue of $10.6 billion and $10.5 billion for 2022 and 2021, respectively. EBIT was $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Excluding the non-core and unusual items referenced in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", adjusted EBIT was $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nSales revenue in 2022 compared to 2021 was relatively unchanged as higher selling prices, resulting from higher raw material, energy, and distribution prices, were mostly offset by lower sales volume. Sales volume was lower due to an unfavorable impact from divested businesses and limited product availability in the first nine months of the year resulting from unplanned outages. The Company experienced significantly lower end-market demand and customer inventory destocking, mostly in fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted EBIT decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower sales volume; higher manufacturing costs resulting from planned and unplanned outages; an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchanges rates; and continued investment in growth. These factors were partially offset by higher selling prices, net of higher raw material and energy costs, and distribution costs, as well as lower SG&#38;A costs, primarily due to variable compensation costs. \n\nOn January 31, 2022, the Company had an incident at its Kingsport site as a result of a steam line failure (the \"steam line incident\"). Consistent with Eastman's safety processes, all manufacturing operations at the site were safely shut down following the incident. All impacted areas of the manufacturing facility were operational as of March 31, 2022. The primary impacted area was specialty copolyesters in the AM segment. The Fibers segment was also modestly impacted. Incremental costs, net of insurance proceeds, of $39 million for 2022, primarily related to the repair of damaged infrastructure, were excluded from the Company's adjusted EBIT. \n\nOn November 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the rubber additives (including Crystex&#8482; insoluble sulfur and Santoflex&#8482; antidegradants) and other product lines and related assets and technology of the global tire additives business of its AFP segment (\"rubber additives\"). The sale did not include the Eastman Impera&#8482; and other performance resins product lines of the tire additives business. \n\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the adhesives resins business, which included hydrocarbon resins (including Eastman Impera&#8482; tire resins), pure monomer resins, polyolefin polymers, rosins and dispersions, and oleochemical and fatty-acid based resins product lines, of its AFP segment (\"adhesives resins\"). \n\nFor additional information on the sales of the rubber additives business and the adhesive resins business, see Note 2, \"Divestitures\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nDiscussion of sales revenue and EBIT changes is presented in \"Results of Operations\" and \"Summary by Operating Segment\" in this MD&#38;A. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nNet earnings and EPS and adjusted net earnings and EPS were as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 (Dollars in millions, except diluted EPS) &#160; $ \n\nEPS &#160; $ \n\nEPS Net earnings attributable to Eastman $ 793 $ 6.35 $ 857 $ 6.25 Total non-core and unusual items, net of tax 191 1.53 356 2.60 Net earnings attributable to Eastman excluding non-core and unusual items $ 984 $ 7.88 $ 1,213 $ 8.85 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company generated $975 million and $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nEastman's results of operations as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report are summarized and analyzed below. \n\nSales ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Change Sales $ 10,580 $ 10,476 1 % Volume / product mix effect &#160; &#160; (3) % Price effect &#160; &#160; 14 % Exchange rate effect &#160; &#160; (2) % Divested business effect (1) \n\n(8) % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Contribution to sales revenue of businesses divested which are not in 2022 comparable periods. \n\nSales revenue increased as a result of increases in all operating segments.

There were no debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of this debt. \n\nIn 2021, the Company amended and restated the $1.50 billion revolving credit agreement (the \"Credit Facility\").

For additional financial and product information for each operating segment, see \"Business - Business Segments\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report and Note 20, \"Segment and Regional Sales Information\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and the recasted financial information for the AFP segment and \"Other\" in Part II, Item 5, \"Other Information\" of the Quarterly Repor t on Form 10-Q for first quarter 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Advanced Materials Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 $ % Sales $ 3,207 $ 3,027 $ 180 6 % Volume / product mix effect (127) (4) % Price effect 391 13 % Exchange rate effect (84) (3) % EBIT $ 376 $ 519 $ (143) (28) % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 19 9 10 Accelerated depreciation &#8212; 4 (4) EBIT excluding non-core items 395 532 (137) (26) % ##TABLE_END\n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nSales revenue increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. Higher selling prices across all product lines were due to higher raw material, energy, and distribution prices. Lower sales volume was due to reduced demand and significant destocking attributed to global economic uncertainty in consumer durables and building and construction end-markets, primarily in fourth quarter 2022, as well as planned and unplanned outages. The lower sales volume was partially offset by favorable product mix due to increased sales of premium products in the advanced interlayers and specialty plastics product lines. \n\nEBIT in 2022 and 2021 included asset impairment and restructuring charges, net, and in 2021 included accelerated depreciation. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges see Note 16, \"Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nExcluding these non-core items, EBIT decreased primarily due to: $79 million of lower sales volume and higher manufacturing costs, primarily due to lower capacity utilization and costs from planned and unplanned outages; $34 million of an unfavorable shift in foreign exchange rates; and $14 million of higher growth spending. \n\nInitiatives \n\nIn 2022, the AM segment: \n\n&#8226; achieved key milestones for planned molecular recycling facilities (see \"Corporate Overview - Business Strategy - Sustainability and Circular Economy - Circularity\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report); \n\n&#8226; continued adoption of polyester renewal technology for products including, Tritan &#8482; Renew, Cristal &#8482; Renew, and Cristal &#8482; One Renew across several end-markets, including cosmetic packaging, eyewear and power tools; and \n\n&#8226; continued to expand portfolio of differentiated post-applied window films and protective films for automotive and architectural applications. \n\n##TABLE_START Additives &#38; Functional Products Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 $ % Sales $ 3,165 $ 2,708 $ 457 17 % Volume / product mix effect 71 3 % Price effect 490 18 % Exchange rate effect (104) (4) % EBIT $ 483 $ 448 $ 35 8 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net &#8212; 4 (4) EBIT excluding non-core item 483 452 31 7 % ##TABLE_END\n\nSales revenue increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume, partially offset by an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. Higher selling prices were due to strong demand across several key end-markets. Cost pass-through contracts represented approximately 45 percent of the selling price increase in 2022. The increase in sales volume due to growth in care additives and animal nutrition product lines was mostly offset by a decline in building and construction and industrial end-markets primarily attributed to deceleration of demand and customer inventory destocking in fourth quarter 2022 attributed to global economic uncertainty. \n\nEBIT in 2021 included asset impairments and restructuring charges, net. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges see Note 16, \"Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nExcluding these non-core items, EBIT increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: $49 million higher selling prices, net of higher raw material and energy costs, and higher distribution costs; lower SG&#38;A costs partially offset by higher R&#38;D costs, totaling $10 million; $14 million unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates; and $9 million of higher manufacturing costs. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nInitiatives \n\nIn 2022, the AFP segment: \n\n&#8226; expanded capacity and capabilities of Eastapure &#8482; electronic solvents for use in manufacturing of semiconductor chips and other electronic applications with extremely low organic and inorganic impurities; \n\n&#8226; realized additional production capacity across its Global Alkylamines assets through optimization projects; and \n\n&#8226; continued global launch of Fluid Genius &#8482; , a patent-pending product that equips end-users with predictive insights to optimize heat transfer fluid performance by leveraging artificial intelligence technology with Eastman expertise to monitor and maximize the life cycle of heat transfer fluids for a myriad of system applications. \n\n##TABLE_START Chemical Intermediates Segment Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 $ % Sales $ 3,026 $ 2,849 $ 177 6 % Volume / product mix effect (238) (8) % Price effect 462 16 % Exchange rate effect (47) (2) % EBIT $ 409 $ 445 $ (36) (8) % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 3 16 (13) EBIT excluding non-core item 412 461 (49) (11) % ##TABLE_END\n\nSales revenue increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher selling prices, resulting from higher raw material, energy, and distribution prices, as well as constrained market conditions. This increase was partially offset by lower sales volume and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in sales volume, primarily in plasticizers, which was partially offset by demand growth in the agriculture end-market for functional amines, was broadened in fourth quarter 2022 due to slowing demand in the building and construction and industrial end-markets, primarily attributed to deceleration of demand and customer inventory destocking related to global economic uncertainty. \n\nEBIT in 2022 and 2021 included asset impairment and restructuring charges, net. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges see Note 16, \"Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nExcluding these non-core items, EBIT decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to $121 million lower sales volume and higher manufacturing costs partially offset by $60 million higher selling prices, net of higher raw material and energy costs, and higher distribution costs, and $31 million lower SG&#38;A costs. In addition, there was a $14 million unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n##TABLE_START Fibers Segment (Dollars in millions) Change 2022 2021 $ % Sales $ 1,022 $ 900 $ 122 14 % Volume / product mix effect (10) (1) % Price effect 139 15 % Exchange rate effect (7) &#8212; % EBIT $ 131 $ 142 $ (11) (8) % Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net 9 &#8212; 9 EBIT excluding non-core item 140 142 (2) (1) % ##TABLE_END\n\nSales revenue increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher selling prices across the segment due to higher raw material, energy, and distribution prices. \n\nEBIT in 2022 included asset impairment and restructuring charges, net.

Additionally, on April 1, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries completed the sale of its adhesives resins business. The sale included hydrocarbon resins (including Eastman Impera&#8482; tire resins), pure monomer resins, polyolefin polymers, rosins and dispersions, and oleochemical and fatty-acid based resins product lines, all of which were also previously part of the AFP segment. \n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, sales revenue and EBIT of the divested businesses are included in \"Other\". To maintain comparability of segment financial statement information, the Company has recast the segment financial information for the AFP segment and \"Other\" for each quarter from first quarter 2019 through fourth quarter 2021. For more information, see the Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 18, 2022, and Part II, Item 5, \"Other Information\" of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for first quarter 2022. \n\nCosts related to growth initiatives, including circular economy, R&#38;D costs, certain components of pension and other postretirement benefits, and other expenses and income not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in operating segment results for any of the periods presented and are included in \"Other\". In 2022, the Company recognized costs, net of insurance proceeds from the steam line incident, environmental and other costs from previously divested or non-operational sites, and adjustments to contingent considerations. In 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized severance and related costs as part of business improvement and cost reduction initiatives.

Higher sales revenue was primarily due to higher selling prices (up 14 percent) partially offset by lower sales volume (down 11 percent, including the impact from divested businesses) and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates (down 2 percent). The most significant increase in sales revenue occurred in the United States and Canada, primarily due to higher selling prices across all operating segments partially offset by lower sales volume from the divested businesses. \n\nSee Note 20, \"Segment and Regional Sales Information\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for segment sales revenues by customer location. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION \n\nCash Flows \n\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 493 $ 459 ##TABLE_END\n\nCash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company's cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman's products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under \"Risk Factors\" in this MD&#38;A. Management believes maintaining a financial profile that supports an investment grade credit rating is important to its long-term strategy and financial flexibility. \n\n##TABLE_START For years ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): &#160; &#160; Operating activities $ 975 $ 1,619 Investing activities 392 (29) Financing activities (1,321) (1,690) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (12) (5) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 34 (105) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 459 564 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 493 $ 459 ##TABLE_END\n\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $644 million due to lower net earnings adjusted for both loss on divested businesses and mark-to-market pension and other postretirement benefit plans (gain) loss, net, as well as higher variable compensation payout. The use of cash in working capital also increased, driven by higher inventory due to continued inflationary pressures and lower sales volume. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nCash provided by investing activities was $392 million in 2022 compared with cash used in investing activities of $29 million in 2021 primarily due to proceeds from the sale of the adhesives resins business in 2022 greater than proceeds from the sale of the tire additives business in 2021. In addition, 2021 included cash used for acquisitions in the AFP and AM segments. \n\nCash used in financing activities decreased $369 million primarily due to proceeds from borrowings including net increase in commercial paper partially offset by repayment of borrowings. \n\nWorking Capital Management \n\nEastman applies a proactive and disciplined approach to working capital management to optimize cash flow and to enable a full range of capital allocation options in support of the Company's strategy. Eastman expects to continue utilizing the programs described below to support operating cash flow consistent with the Company's past practices. \n\nThe Company has an off balance sheet, uncommitted accounts receivable factoring program under which entire invoices may be sold, without recourse, to third-party financial institutions. Available capacity under these agreements, which the Company uses as a routine source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables. The total amount of receivables sold in 2022 and 2021 were $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Based on the original terms of receivables sold for certain agreements and actual outstanding balance of receivables under service agreements, the Company estimates that $402 million and $239 million of these receivables would have been outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, had they not been sold under these factoring agreements. \n\nEastman works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working \n\ncapital and cash flows. The Company has a voluntary supply chain finance program to provide suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from Eastman to a participating financial institution. See Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding both programs. \n\nDebt and Other Commitments \n\nEastman has debt and other commitments for debt securities, credit facilities, interest payable, purchase obligations, operating leases, and other liabilities. A summary of the Company's debt and other commitment obligations as of December 31, 2022 for each of the next five years and beyond is included in Note 12, \"Leases and Other Commitments\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Eastman's borrowings totaled approximately $5.2 billion with various maturities. In second quarter 2022, the Company repaid $550 million of the 3.6% notes due August 2022. In third quarter 2022, the Company repaid the remaining $200 million principal of the 3.6% notes due August 2022 using available cash. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company repaid the 3.5% notes due December 2021 ($300 million principal) using available cash. For information about debt and related interest, see Note 9, \"Borrowings\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nFor information about purchase obligations and operating leases, see Note 12, \"Leases and Other Commitments\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nAmounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, accrued compensation benefits, environmental loss contingency estimates, uncertain tax liabilities, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the \"2028 and beyond\" line item. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe amount and timing of pension and other postretirement benefit payments included in other liabilities is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Excess contributions are periodically made by management in order to keep the plans' funded status above 80 percent under the funding provisions of the Pension Protection Act to avoid partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payment. The Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans are not currently under any benefit restrictions. See Note 11, \"Retirement Plans\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, for more information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. \n\nThe resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters included in other liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See \"Environmental Costs\" in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, and see Note 13, \"Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding outstanding environmental matters and asset retirement obligations. \n\nCredit Facility, Term Loan, and Commercial Paper Borrowings \n\nThe Company has access to a $1.50 billion revolving credit agreement (the \"Credit Facility\") expiring December 2026. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. The Credit Facility includes sustainability-linked pricing terms, provides available liquidity for general corporate purposes, and supports commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2022, the Company's commercial paper borrowings were $326 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.85%. \n\nIn 2022, the Company borrowed $500 million under a five-year term loan agreement (the \"2027 Term Loan\") and used the proceeds from the 2027 Term Loan to pay down $500 million of the 3.6% notes due August 2022. The 2027 Term Loan had a variable interest rate of 5.55% as of December 31, 2022. \n\nIn January 2023, the Company borrowed $300 million under a delayed draw two-year term loan (the \"2024 Term Loan\"), which was executed in fourth quarter 2022. Borrowings under the 2024 Term Loan are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. The 2024 Term Loan contains the same customary covenants and events of default, including maintenance of certain financial ratios, as the Credit Facility, with payment of customary fees. \n\nThe Credit Facility and 2027 Term Loan contain customary covenants, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, that determine the events of default, amounts available, and terms of borrowings. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2022. The total amount of available borrowings under the Credit Facility was $1.50 billion as of December 31, 2022. For additional information regarding financial covenants under the Credit Facility, see Section 5.03 of the Credit Facility at Exhibit 10.01 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 30, 2020 . \n\nSee Note 9, \"Borrowings\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nNet Debt ##TABLE_START December 31, December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Total borrowings $ 5,151 $ 5,159 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 493 459 \n\nNet debt (1) \n\n$ 4,658 $ 4,700 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes a non-cash decrease from foreign currency exchange rates of $85 million and $113 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nCapital expenditures were $611 million and $555 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2022 were primarily for the AM segment methanolysis plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tennessee, and other targeted growth initiatives and site modernization projects. \n\nThe Company expects that 2023 capital spending will be approximately $700 million to $800 million, primarily for targeted growth initiatives, including the AM segment methanolysis plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling manufacturing facility and the Tritan &#8482; capacity expansion, both in Kingsport, Tennessee, and other targeted growth initiatives and site modernization projects. \n\nThe Company had capital expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement of approximately $60 million and $38 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company does not currently expect near term environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially impact the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. \n\nDividends and Stock Repurchases \n\nIn February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders (the \"2018 authorization\"). The Company completed the 2018 authorization in May 2022, acquiring a total of 19,915,370 shares. In December 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders (the \"2021 authorization\"). As of December 31, 2022, a total of 6,743,883 shares have been repurchased under the 2021 authorization for $635 million. Both dividends and share repurchases are key strategies employed by the Company to return value to its stockholders. \n\nIn fourth quarter 2021, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (\"2021 ASR\") to purchase $500 million of the Company's common stock under the 2018 authorization. In exchange for upfront payment totaling $500 million, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the 2021 ASR's purchase period, which was settled in first quarter 2022. The total number of shares ultimately delivered was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock during the term of the 2021 ASR, less a discount. Approximately 80 percent of the expected shares repurchased under the 2021 ASR were delivered in fourth quarter 2021 and the remaining shares were delivered in first quarter 2022. \n\nIn second quarter 2022, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (\"2022 ASR\") to purchase $500 million of the Company's common stock under the Board approved authorizations. In exchange for upfront payment totaling $500 million, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the 2022 ASR's purchase period, which was settled in third quarter 2022. The total number of shares ultimately delivered was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock during the term of the 2022 ASR, less a discount. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company repurchased 10,710,259 shares of common stock for $1,102 million, which included $100 million from the settlement of the 2021 ASR. \n\nThe Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.79 per share during the first quarter of 2023, payable on April 10, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2023. Both dividends and share repurchases are key strategies employed by the Company to return value to its stockholders. \n\nINFLATION \n\nIn 2022, the Company experienced rapid, broad-based inflation across its portfolio, including higher raw material and energy costs and higher distribution costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although derivative financial instruments are utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market price fluctuations. Management expects the volatility of raw material and energy costs to continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors\" and \"Summary by Operating Segments\" in this MD&#38;A, and Note 10, \"Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nFor information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nRISK FACTORS \n\nIn addition to factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are the material known factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\". The risks described below should be carefully considered, some of which have manifested and any of which may occur in the future, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report before making an investment decision with respect to any of the Company's securities. The following risk factors are not necessarily presented in the order of importance. In addition, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. This and other related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report, and elsewhere from time to time, represent management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in Company press releases, or in other public Company presentations) on related subjects. \n\nRisks Related to Global Economy and Industry Conditions \n\nContinued uncertain conditions in the global economy, labor market, and financial markets could negatively impact the Company. \n\nThe Company's business and operating results were impacted by the last global recession, and its related impacts, such as the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that impacted the global economy. Similarly, as a company which operates and sells products worldwide, uncertainty in the global economy, labor market, and capital markets (including impacts from inflation, higher interest rates, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent changes and disruptions in business, political, and economic conditions) have impacted and may adversely impact demand for and the costs of certain Eastman products and accordingly results of operations, and may adversely impact the Company's financial condition and cash flows and ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms and negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives. \n\nBoth domestic and international markets experienced significant inflationary pressures in 2022 and inflation rates in the U.S., as well as in other countries in which the Company operates, are currently expected to continue at elevated levels for the near-term. In addition, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and other central banks in various countries have raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. Interest rate increases or other government actions taken to reduce inflation could also result in recessionary pressures in many parts of the world. \n\nVolatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply and transportation of these commodities and in transportation of company products could adversely impact the Company's financial results. \n\nEastman is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes certain risk management tools to mitigate market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. The cost and availability of these raw materials and energy commodities can be adversely impacted by factors such as business and economic conditions, anomalous severe weather events, natural disasters, the global COVID-19 pandemic, plant interruptions, supply chain and transportation disruptions (related to the global COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise), changes in laws or regulations, levels of unemployment and inflation, currency exchange rates, higher interest rates, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism (such as the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict), and breakdown or degradation of transportation and supply chain infrastructure. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nRecent inflationary pressures affecting the general economy, energy markets, and certain raw materials have increased the Company's operating costs. For example, inflationary pressures in 2022 have resulted in increased costs for energy and feedstocks such as natural gas, paraxylene, vinyl acetate monomer, polyvinyl alcohol, and others. While inflation in these and other inputs has increased operating costs, the Company has undertaken efforts to offset many of these costs through pricing actions, including contract terms and some surcharges, contracts leveraged to multiple market indices, alternative supply arrangements, and hedging strategies, however, these risk mitigation measures do not eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations. \n\nIn addition to these inflationary pressures, the Company has experienced certain supply chain challenges impacting its ability to secure certain raw materials and timely distribute products to customers. For example, the global supply chain disruptions have impacted the availability of certain raw materials such as ammonia, methanol, and toluene. To mitigate the effects of these and other supply chain disruptions, the Company has implemented multifaceted sourcing, warehousing, and delivery strategies to focus on building resilient and redundant supply positions, and minimizing disruptions to customers by using alternate shipping methods to expedite delivery times. The Company's geographic footprint has also helped reduce exposure to localized risks. \n\nProlonged periods of heightened inflation or continued or worsening supply chain disruptions could have a material, adverse impact on the Company's financial performance and results of operations. \n\nThe Company's substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in other countries, including U.S. and non-U.S. trade relations, which could adversely impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nMore than half of Eastman's sales for 2022 were to customers outside of North America. The Company expects sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its sales. Also, a significant portion of the Company's manufacturing capacity is located outside of the United States. Accordingly, the Company's business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements, and economic conditions of many jurisdictions including the unique geographic impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact product demand and may adversely impact the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, the U.S. and foreign countries have imposed and may impose additional taxes or otherwise tax Eastman's foreign income (see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Income Taxes\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report). For example, the Organization for Economic Development has proposed the introduction of a global minimum tax. While details around the timing and impact of a global minimum tax are uncertain, if enacted, the Company may experience an increase in tax obligations in jurisdictions it conducts business. \n\nThe U.S. and foreign countries may also adopt or increase restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, tariffs or other taxes, or limitations on imports or exports (including recent and proposed changes in U.S. trade policy and resulting retaliatory actions by other countries, including China, which have recently reduced and which may increasingly reduce demand for and increase costs of impacted products or result in U.S.-based trade counterparties limiting trade with U.S.-based companies or non-U.S. customers limiting their purchases from U.S.-based companies). Certain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Eastman's global scope. For example, it may be more difficult for Eastman to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems, and the laws of some countries may not protect the Company's intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Eastman's intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in loss of valuable proprietary information. There is also risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Eastman operates. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Eastman's corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where Eastman operates are a risk to the Company's financial performance. As Eastman continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage and mitigate these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse impact on Eastman's business, financial condition, or results of operations. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nRisks Related to the Company's Business and Strategy \n\nThe Company's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical and specialty materials manufacturing businesses, including cybersecurity risks, any of which could disrupt manufacturing operations or related infrastructure and adversely impact results of operations. \n\nAs a global specialty materials company, Eastman's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling, and transportation, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation and supply chain interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. Significant limitation on the Company's ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the Company's sales revenue, costs, results of operations, credit ratings, and financial condition. Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as supply chain disruption, computer or equipment malfunction at third-party service providers, natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber-attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation and supply chain infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. The Company has in the past experienced cyber-attacks and breaches of its computer information systems, although none of these have had a material adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial results. While the Company remains committed to managing cyber related risk, no assurances can be provided that any future disruptions due to these, or other, circumstances will not have a material impact on operations (see \"Business - Eastman Chemical Company General Information - Information Security\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report). Unplanned disruptions of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors, and the environment, and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. \n\nGrowth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require significant resources in addition to or different from those available or in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives. \n\nEastman continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both organic and inorganic initiatives, such as Eastman's sustainable innovation initiatives which aim to develop a more \"circular economy.\" These and other growth opportunities include development and commercialization or licensing of innovative new products and technologies and related employee leadership, expertise, skill development and retention, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities. Such initiatives are necessarily constrained by availability and development of additional resources, including development, attraction, and retention of employee leadership, application development, and sales and marketing talent and capabilities. There can be no assurance that such innovation, development and commercialization or licensing efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances (including integration of acquired businesses) will receive necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, or result in financially successful commercialization of products, or acceptance by existing or new customers, or successful entry into new markets or otherwise achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Company's results of operations. There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively impact the returns from any proposed or current investments and projects. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nSignificant acquisitions or divestitures could expose the Company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nWhile acquisitions and divestitures have been and continue to be a part of Eastman's strategy, acquisitions of large companies and acquisitions or divestitures of businesses subject the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the actual and projected future financial performance of the acquired or remaining business may be significantly worse than expected and that, in the case of an acquired business and as reported in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Goodwill\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report, the carrying values of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and certain assets from acquisitions may, as has been the case for certain acquired assets, be impaired resulting in non-cash charges to future earnings and, in the case of a divested business, the divestiture could reduce Eastman's revenue and, potentially, margins and increase its costs and liabilities in the form of transition costs and retained liabilities from the operations divested, including environmental liabilities; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the Company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other \"synergies\" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the integration of the new business or specific assets or product lines or separation of the divested business or specific assets or product lines resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the Company's legacy businesses; and that the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business or specific assets or product lines into Eastman or separate any divested business or specific assets or product lines from Eastman, or that the integration or separation efforts will not achieve the expected benefits. \n\nRisks Related to Regulatory Changes and Compliance \n\nLegislative, regulatory, or voluntary actions, including associated with physical impacts of climate change, could increase the Company's future health, safety, and environmental compliance costs. \n\nEastman, its facilities, and its businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws, regulations, and related voluntary actions, both in the U.S. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws, regulations, and voluntary actions. The Company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. For example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number of and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations and actions, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. Specifically, while the Company's sustainability and \"circular economy\" innovation initiatives are sources of competitive strength (see \"Business - Corporate Overview - Business Strategy - Circular Economy and Sustainability\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report), future changes in legislation and regulation and related voluntary actions associated with physical impacts of climate change may increase the likelihood that the Company's manufacturing facilities will in the future be impacted by carbon requirements, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and energy policy, and may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct and indirect compliance or other costs or consequences including decreased demand for products related to carbon-based energy sources or increased demand for goods that result in lower emissions than competing products and reputational risk resulting from operations with greenhouse gas emissions. See \"Business - Eastman Chemical Company General Information - Compliance With Environmental and Other Government Regulations\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nEastman has exposure to various market risks principally due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the pricing of various commodities, and interest rates. In an effort to manage these risks, the Company employs various strategies, including pricing, inventory management, and hedging. The Company enters into derivative contracts which are governed by policies, procedures, and internal processes set forth by its Board of Directors. \n\nThe Company determines its exposures to market risk by utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates. \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\nDue to a portion of the Company's operating cash flows and borrowings being denominated in foreign currencies, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. The Company manages most foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets. To mitigate foreign currency risk, from time to time, the Company enters into derivative instruments to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies, and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. Additionally, the Company, from time to time, enters into non-derivative and derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. The foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-denominated borrowings. It is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency derivative and non-derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the market risk associated with certain cash flows under these derivative transactions assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies was $50 million, with an additional $4 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those foreign currency rates. Since the Company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value from those instruments is generally offset by an increase in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, a 10 percent fluctuation in the euro currency rate would have had a $196 million impact on the designated net investment values in the foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the designation of the euro-denominated borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedges of the net investments, foreign currency translation gains and losses on the borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of the \"Change in cumulative translation adjustment\" within \"Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Therefore, a foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-denominated borrowings or the foreign currency change in the designated cross-currency interest rate swaps. \n\nCommodity Risk \n\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its raw materials and energy, as well as contract sales of certain commodity products. To mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene, as well as selling prices for ethylene, the Company enters into derivative transactions, from time to time, to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period. At December 31, 2022, the market risk associated with these derivative contracts, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent and no corresponding change in the selling price of finished goods, was $3 million, with an additional $300 thousand of exposure at December 31, 2022 for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nEastman is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. The nature and amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. The Company manages global interest rate exposure as part of regular operational and financing strategies. The Company had $825 million variable interest rate borrowings (including term loan borrowings and commercial paper borrowings) at December 31, 2022. \n\nEastman may enter into interest rate swaps, collars, or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to the Company's borrowing costs. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $75 million. For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the Company uses a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates. The corresponding market risk of the interest rate swap hedging the interest rate risk on the 3.8% bonds maturing March 2025 and the interest rate swap hedging the variability in interest rates for long-term debt issuances was $5 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\n"

McLain, Jr. Chief Executive Officer Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 15, 2023 February 15, 2023 ##TABLE_END\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Eastman Chemical Company \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Eastman Chemical Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Reporting Unit in the Additives &#38; Functional Products Segment \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated goodwill balance was $3,664 million as of December 31, 2022, and the goodwill associated with the Additives &#38; Functional Products segment was $1,601 million. Management conducts testing of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Management used an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model, in testing the carrying value of goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment. As disclosed by management, key assumptions and estimates used in the Company's goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), the estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and a projected long-term growth rate. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment for a reporting unit in the Additives &#38; Functional Products segment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to projections of revenues and EBIT, the estimated WACC, and the projected long-term growth rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of a reporting unit in the Additives &#38; Functional Products segment. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate of a reporting unit in the Additives &#38; Functional Products segment, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to projections of revenues and EBIT, the estimated WACC, and the projected long-term growth rate. Evaluating management's assumptions related to projections of revenues and EBIT and the projected long- term growth rate involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external industry reports, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nFinancial Statement Presentation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company (\"Eastman\" or the \"Company\") and subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted (\"GAAP\") in the United States and of necessity include some amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. Future actual results could differ from such current estimates. The consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, sales revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained. Eastman accounts for other joint ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises significant influence on the equity basis. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period data has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform to current period presentation, including sales revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\"), assets, depreciation and amortization expense, and capital expenditures related to the divested rubber additives product lines and related assets and technology and the adhesives resins business. See Note 20, \"Segment and Regional Sales Information\", for more information. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\nAccounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-05 Leases (Topic 842): Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments : On January 1, 2022, Eastman adopted this update which is a part of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") post-implementation review of this Topic. The update provides that lessors should classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate as an operating lease if both: the lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease and the lessor would have otherwise recognized a day-one loss. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nASU 2021-10 Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance : On January 1, 2022, Eastman adopted prospectively this amendment which requires business entities that account for transactions with a government by applying a grant or contribution model by analogy (for example, a grant model within International Financial Reporting Standards) to provide annual disclosures about government assistance recorded during the period. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nAccounting Standards Issued But Not Adopted as of December 31, 2022 \n\nASU 2021-08 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers : The FASB issued this update in October 2021, which requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as if it had originated the contracts. The update also provides certain practical expedients for acquirers and is applicable to all contract assets and liabilities within the scope of Topic 606. The expedients are as follows: \"provides relief for contracts that have been previously modified before the acquisition date\" and \"relief for situations in which the acquirer does not have the appropriate data or expertise to analyze the historical periods in which the contract was entered into\". This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. Adoption is on a prospective basis to business combinations occurring on or after the initial application. Management does not expect that changes required by the new standard will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nASU 2022-01 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging&#8212;Portfolio Layer Method : The FASB issued this update in March 2022. This ASU clarifies the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 815 on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets. This ASU amends the guidance in ASU 2017-12 (released on August 28, 2017) that, among other things, established the \"last-of-layer\" method for making the fair value hedge accounting for these portfolios more accessible. ASU 2022-01 renames that method the \"portfolio layer\" method and addresses feedback from stakeholders regarding its application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. Management does not expect that changes required by the new standard will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures : The FASB issued this update in March 2022. This ASU updates the requirements for accounting for credit losses under ASC 326, eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings for creditors in ASC 310-40, and enhances creditors' disclosure requirements related to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This ASU also amends the guidance on \"vintage disclosures\" to require disclosure of gross write-offs by year of origination. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. Management does not expect that changes required by the new standard will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nASU 2022-03 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions : The FASB issued this update in June 2022, which states that when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, a reporting entity should consider the characteristics of the asset or liability, including restrictions on the sale of the asset or liability, if a market participant also would take those characteristics into account. Key to that determination is the unit of account for the asset or liability being measured at fair value. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Management does not expect that changes required by the new standard will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nASU 2022-04 Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations : The FASB issued this update in September 2022, which requires the buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the program. Required disclosures include information about the key terms of the program, outstanding confirmed amounts as of the end of the period, a rollforward of such amounts during each annual period, and a description of where in the financial statements outstanding amounts are presented. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the changes required by the new standard on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nASU 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 : The FASB issued this update in December 2022, which extends the temporary optional relief in accounting for the impact of reference rate reform under Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The amendments apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. This update was effective immediately upon issuance, with no impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nEastman recognizes revenue when performance obligations of the sale are satisfied. Eastman sells to customers through master sales agreements or standalone purchase orders. The majority of the Company's terms of sale have a single performance obligation to transfer products. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. \n\nEastman accounts for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good and does not allocate revenue to those activities. All related shipping and handling costs are recognized at the time of shipment. Amounts collected for sales or other similar taxes are presented net of the related tax expense rather than presenting them as additional revenue. The incremental cost of obtaining a sales contract is recognized as a selling expense when incurred given the potential amortization period for such an asset is one year or less. The possible existence of a significant financing component within a sales contract is ignored when the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year. Finally, the Company does not disclose any unfulfilled obligations as customer purchase order commitments have an original expected duration of one year or less and no consideration from customers is excluded from the transaction price. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nThe timing of Eastman's customer billings does not always match the timing of revenue recognition. When the Company is entitled to bill a customer in advance of the recognition of revenue, a contract liability is recognized. When the Company is not entitled to bill a customer until a period after the related recognition of revenue, a contract asset is recognized. Contract assets represent the Company's right to consideration for the exchange of goods under a contract but which are not yet billable to a customer for consignment inventory or pursuant to certain shipping terms. Contract liabilities were $ 18 million and $ 14 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included as a part of \"Payables and other current liabilities\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Contract assets were $ 93 million and $ 82 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included as a component of \"Miscellaneous receivables\" in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 20, \"Segment and Regional Sales Information\". \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\nEastman maintains defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. The estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company's assumptions related to discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase or decrease for employees, and health care cost trends. The estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. \n\nEastman's pension and other postretirement benefit plans costs consist of two elements: 1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credits; and 2) mark-to-market (\"MTM\") gains and losses recognized annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, primarily resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets. Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes are recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 11, \"Retirement Plans\". \n\nEnvironmental Costs \n\nEastman recognizes environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company recognizes the minimum undiscounted amount. This undiscounted amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years and the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. \n\nThe Company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a loss contingency reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. The Company recognizes the asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. These future estimated costs are charged to earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. If the Company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, earnings will be impacted in the period the estimate is changed. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life and charged to \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. \n\nEnvironmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, or mitigate the possibility of future contamination. The cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings, as incurred. \n\nFor additional information see Note 13, \"Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\". \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nEastman recognizes compensation expense in \"Selling, general and administrative expense\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for stock options and other share-based compensation awards based upon the grant-date fair value over the substantive vesting period. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 18, \"Share-Based Compensation Plans and Awards\". \n\nRestructuring of Operations \n\nEastman records restructuring charges for costs incurred in connection with consolidation of operations, exited business or product lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that are expected to be substantially completed within twelve months. These restructuring charges are recorded as incurred, and are associated with site closures, legal and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, obsolete inventory, or other costs and charges directly related to the restructuring. The Company records severance charges for employee separations when the separation is probable and reasonably estimable. In the event employees are required to perform future service, the Company records severance charges ratably over the remaining service period of those employees. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 16, \"Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net\". \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Eastman's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The recoverability of the Company's deferred tax assets are evaluated each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the Company's net deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and management judgment. Eastman's income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. The Company has evaluated these potential issues under the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. The Company accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on the balance sheet. The accrued interest related to unrecognized income tax positions and taxes resulting from the global intangible low-tax income are recorded as a component of the income tax provision. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 8, \"Income Taxes\". \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nEastman records recurring and non-recurring financial assets and liabilities as well as all non-financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. An asset or liability's classification within the various levels is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses \n\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Eastman maintains allowances for estimated credit losses, which are developed at a market, country, and region level based on risk of collection as well as current and forecasted economic conditions. The Company calculates the allowance based on an assessment of the risk when the accounts receivable is recognized. Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. Allowance for credit losses was $ 15 million and $ 17 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company does not enter into receivables of a long-term nature, also known as financing receivables, in the normal course of business. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories measured by the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method are valued at the lower of cost or market and inventories measured by the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Eastman determines the cost of most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the United States and Switzerland by the LIFO method. The cost of all other inventories is determined by the average cost method, which approximates the FIFO method. The Company writes-down its inventories equal to the difference between the carrying value of inventory and the estimated market value or net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 3, \"Inventories\". \n\nProperties \n\nEastman records properties at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. When Eastman retires or otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related accumulated depreciation from the accounts. The Company records any profit or loss on retirement or other disposition in \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Asset impairments are reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation for properties that have been placed in service. In instances when an asset has not been placed in service and is impaired, the associated costs are removed from the appropriate property accounts. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 4, \"Properties and Accumulated Depreciation\". \n\nDepreciation and Amortization \n\nDepreciation expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for buildings and building equipment generally range from 20 to 50 years . Estimated useful lives generally ranging from 3 to 33 years are applied to machinery and equipment in the following categories: computer software ( 3 to 5 years ); office furniture and fixtures and computer equipment ( 5 to 10 years ); vehicles, railcars, and general machinery and equipment ( 5 to 20 years ); and manufacturing-related improvements ( 20 to 33 years ). Accelerated depreciation is reported when the estimated useful life is shortened and continues to be reported in \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 4, \"Properties and Accumulated Depreciation\". \n\nAmortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets is generally determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense is reported in \"Cost of sales\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 5, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\". \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nDefinite-lived Assets \n\nProperties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by Eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review of properties and equipment and the review of definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill is an asset determined as the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets and liabilities \n\nacquired in a business combination. Eastman conducts testing of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The testing of goodwill is performed at the \"reporting unit\" level which the Company has determined to be its \"components\". Components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a \"business\" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by Company operating segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. An impairment is recognized when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. The Company uses an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model, in testing the carrying value of goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment. \n\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets \n\nEastman conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the fair value, as established by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. The Company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. The estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant estimated weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") plus a risk premium. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 5, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\". \n\nLeases \n\nThere are two types of leases: financing and operating. Both types of leases have associated right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that are valued at the net present value of the lease payments and recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The discount rate used in the measurement of a right-to-use asset and lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used. The Company elected the accounting policy not to apply the recognition and measurement requirements to short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less and do not include a bargain purchase option. Residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are recognized as rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease. \n\nFor lease accounting policies, see Note 12, \"Leases and Other Commitments\". \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nInvestments \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman and all its subsidiaries and entities or joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained. The Company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in \"Net earnings attributable to Eastman\" and \"Comprehensive income attributable to Eastman\" located in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings and in \"Total equity\" located in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. \n\nInvestments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried under the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in \"Other (income) charges, net\" located in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 6, \"Equity Investments\". \n\nDerivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments \n\nEastman uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. \n\nThe Company's derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and measured at fair value. Hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively for all hedges that no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 10, \"Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments\". \n\nLitigation and Contingent Liabilities \n\nFrom time to time, Eastman and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a contingent loss liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. \n\nWorking Capital Management and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nThe Company has an off balance sheet, uncommitted accounts receivable factoring program under which entire invoices may be sold, without recourse, to third-party financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company sells the invoices at face value, less a transaction fee, which substantially equals fair value with no gain or loss recognized, and no credit loss exposure is retained. Available capacity under these agreements, which the Company uses as a routine source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables. In addition, certain agreements also require that the Company continue to service, administer, and collect the sold accounts receivable at market rates. The total amount of receivables sold in 2022 and 2021 were $ 2.5 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively. \n\nThe Company works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working capital and cash flows. The Company has a voluntary supply chain finance program to provide suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from Eastman to a participating financial institution. Eastman's responsibility is limited to making payments on the terms originally negotiated with suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the financial institution. The range of payment terms Eastman negotiates with suppliers are consistent, regardless of whether a supplier participates in the program. All of Eastman's accounts payable and associated payments are reported consistently in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows regardless of whether they are associated with a vendor who participates in the program. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n2. DIVESTITURES \n\nRubber Additives Divestiture \n\nOn November 1, 2021, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries completed the sale of its rubber additives (including Crystex&#8482; insoluble sulfur and Santoflex&#8482; antidegradants) and other product lines and related assets and technology of the global tire additives business (\"rubber additives\") of its Additives &#38; Functional Products (\"AFP\") segment. The sale did not include the Eastman Impera&#8482; and other performance resins product lines of the tire additives business. The Company provided certain business transition and post-closing services to the buyer on agreed terms, which were completed in 2022. The business was not reported as a discontinued operation because the sale did not have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. \n\nThe total estimated consideration, after estimates of contingent consideration and post-closing adjustments and ongoing agreements through October 2027, was $ 640 million. The additional amount of consideration of up to $ 75 million is to be paid based on performance of divested rubber additives through December 2023. The divestiture resulted in a $ 594 million loss (including cumulative translation adjustment liquidation of $ 23 million and certain costs to sell of $ 7 million ), of which $ 42 million was recorded in 2022. \n\nThe major classes of divested assets and liabilities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Assets divested Trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 107 &#160; Inventories 94 &#160; Other assets 26 &#160; Properties, net of accumulated depreciation 298 &#160; Goodwill 398 &#160; Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization 381 &#160; Assets divested 1,304 &#160; Liabilities divested Payables and other liabilities 48 &#160; Post-employment obligations 34 &#160; Other liabilities 18 &#160; Liabilities divested 100 &#160; Disposal group, net $ 1,204 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSeparately, the Company recognized $ 5 million and $ 15 million of transaction costs for the divested business in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company provided certain business transition and post-closing services to the buyer on agreed terms, which were completed in 2022. The business was not reported as a discontinued operation because the sale did not have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Included in the adhesives resins divestiture was the 50 percent interest in a joint venture that has a manufacturing facility in Nanjing, China, which produces Eastotac&#8482; hydrocarbon tackifying resins for pressure-sensitive adhesives, caulks, and sealants. \n\nThe total estimated consideration, after estimates of post-closing adjustments, was $ 957 million. The divestiture resulted in a $ 1 million loss (including cumulative translation adjustment liquidation of $ 10 million and certain costs to sell of $ 13 million ). \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nThe major classes of divested assets and liabilities as of the date of the divestiture were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Assets divested Trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 129 &#160; Inventories 163 &#160; Other assets 21 &#160; Properties, net of accumulated depreciation 303 &#160; Goodwill 399 &#160; Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization 14 &#160; Assets divested 1,029 &#160; Liabilities divested Payables and other liabilities 83 &#160; Deferred tax liability 7 &#160; Other liabilities 4 &#160; Liabilities divested 94 &#160; Disposal group, net $ 935 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company recognized $ 13 million and $ 3 million of transaction costs for the divested business in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Additionally, the 2021 provision for income taxes includes impacts of the divestiture of rubber additives, including an increase related to non-deductible losses partially offset by a decrease from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. \n\nThe 2020 provision for income taxes includes a $ 27 million decrease as a result of a decrease in previously unrecognized tax positions and a $ 7 million decrease related to adjustments to certain prior year tax returns. \n\nIncome tax incentives, in the form of tax holidays, have been granted to the Company in certain jurisdictions to attract investment and encourage industrial development. The expiration of these tax holidays varies by country. The tax holidays are conditional on the Company meeting certain requirements, including employment and investment thresholds; determination of compliance with these conditions may be subject to challenge by tax authorities in those jurisdictions. No individual tax holiday had a material impact to the Company's earnings in 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities follow: ##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets &#160; Post-employment obligations $ 150 &#160; $ 176 &#160; Net operating loss carryforwards 645 &#160; 637 &#160; Tax credit carryforwards 236 &#160; 212 &#160; Environmental contingencies 64 &#160; 67 &#160; Capitalized research and development expenses 139 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other 239 &#160; 224 &#160; Total deferred tax assets 1,473 &#160; 1,316 &#160; Less: Valuation allowance 258 &#160; 339 &#160; Deferred tax assets less valuation allowance $ 1,215 &#160; $ 977 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities &#160; Property, plant, and equipment $ ( 849 ) $ ( 843 ) Intangible assets ( 272 ) ( 288 ) Investments ( 441 ) ( 369 ) Other ( 201 ) ( 171 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ ( 1,763 ) $ ( 1,671 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 548 ) $ ( 694 ) As recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position: &#160; Other noncurrent assets $ 123 &#160; $ 116 &#160; Deferred income tax liabilities ( 671 ) ( 810 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 548 ) $ ( 694 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nAll foreign earnings, with the exception of short-term liquid assets on certain foreign subsidiaries, including basis differences, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested. As of December 31, 2022, unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaled approximately $ 3.0 billion of which a substantial portion has already been subject to U.S. tax. The Company has not determined the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings and basis differences, as such determination is not practicable. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaled $ 2.4 billion. Of this total, $ 900 million will expire in 1 to 20 years and $ 1.5 billion have no expiration date. A valuation allowance of approximately $ 131 million has been provided against such net operating loss carryforwards and other foreign deferred income tax balances. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, there were no federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. At December 31, 2022, foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 66 million were available to reduce possible future U.S. income taxes, which expire from 2023 to 2032. As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform Act\"), the Company may no longer be able to utilize certain U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $ 54 million has been established on a portion of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, a partial valuation allowance of $ 28 million has been provided against state tax credits that the Company may not be able to utilize. \n\nA partial valuation allowance of $ 42 million has been established for the Solutia, Inc. (\"Solutia\") state net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance will be retained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, or the related statute expires. \n\nThe Tax Reform Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development (\"R&#38;D\") expenses in the period incurred and requires R&#38;D expenses to be capitalized and amortized beginning in 2022. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nAmounts due to and from tax authorities as recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position: ##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Miscellaneous receivables $ 35 &#160; $ 173 &#160; Payables and other current liabilities $ 95 &#160; $ 68 &#160; Other long-term liabilities 174 &#160; 130 &#160; Total income taxes payable $ 269 &#160; $ 198 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 $ 200 &#160; $ 257 &#160; $ 202 &#160; Adjustments based on tax positions related to current year 11 &#160; 6 &#160; 14 &#160; Adjustments based on tax positions related to prior years 24 &#160; 2 &#160; 63 &#160; Lapse of statute of limitations &#8212; &#160; ( 45 ) ( 22 ) Settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 20 ) &#8212; &#160; \n\nBalance at December 31 (1) \n\n$ 235 &#160; $ 200 &#160; $ 257 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Approximately $ 229 million of the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, would, if recognized, impact the Company's effective tax rate. \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of accrued interest related to unrecognized tax positions is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 $ 13 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 13 &#160; Expense for interest, net of tax 9 &#160; 9 &#160; 5 &#160; Income for interest, net of tax &#8212; &#160; ( 9 ) ( 5 ) Balance at December 31 $ 22 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 13 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAccrued penalties related to unrecognized tax positions were immaterial as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nEastman files federal income tax returns in the U.S. and income tax returns in various state and foreign jurisdictions.

BORROWINGS \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Borrowings consisted of: &#160; &#160; 3.6% notes due August 2022 $ &#8212; &#160; $ 747 &#160; 1.50% notes due May 2023 (1) \n\n800 &#160; 850 &#160; 7 1/4% debentures due January 2024 198 &#160; 198 &#160; 7 5/8% debentures due June 2024 43 &#160; 43 &#160; 3.80% notes due March 2025 693 &#160; 698 &#160; 1.875% notes due November 2026 (1) \n\n530 &#160; 565 &#160; 7.60% debentures due February 2027 196 &#160; 195 &#160; 4.5% notes due December 2028 495 &#160; 494 &#160; 4.8% notes due September 2042 494 &#160; 494 &#160; 4.65% notes due October 2044 877 &#160; 875 &#160; 2027 Term loan \n\n499 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Commercial paper and short-term borrowings 326 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total borrowings 5,151 &#160; 5,159 &#160; Less: Borrowings due within one year 1,126 &#160; 747 &#160; Long-term borrowings $ 4,025 &#160; $ 4,412 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n(1) The carrying value of the euro-denominated 1.50% notes due May 2023 and 1.875% notes due November 2026 will fluctuate with changes in the euro exchange rate. The carrying value of these euro-denominated borrowings have been designated as non-derivative net investment hedges of a portion of the Company's net investments in euro functional-currency denominated subsidiaries to offset foreign currency fluctuations. \n\nIn 2022, the Company repaid the 3.6% notes due August 2022, of which $ 550 million was repaid in second quarter 2022 primarily from proceeds from the 2027 Term Loan discussed below and $ 200 million was repaid in third quarter 2022 using available cash. The total consideration for this redemption is reported under financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nCredit Facility, Term Loan, and Commercial Paper Borrowings \n\nThe Company has access to a $ 1.50 billion revolving credit agreement (the \"Credit Facility\") that was amended and restated in December 2021. The amendments include the addition of sustainability-linked pricing terms and extending the maturity to December 2026, and resulted in a charge of $ 1 million for early debt extinguishment costs which was attributable to unamortized fees. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. The Credit Facility provides available liquidity for general corporate purposes and supports commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings are classified as short-term. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2022, the Company's commercial paper borrowings were $ 326 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.85 %. At December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. \n\nIn 2022, the Company borrowed $ 500 million under a five-year term loan agreement (the \"2027 Term Loan\"). The 2027 Term Loan had a variable interest rate of 5.55 % as of December 31, 2022. Borrowings under the 2027 Term Loan are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. \n\nThe Credit Facility and 2027 Term Loan contain customary covenants, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, that determine the events of default, amounts available, and terms of borrowings. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nFair Value of Borrowings \n\nEastman has classified its total borrowings at December 31, 2022 and 2021 under the fair value hierarchy as defined in the accounting policies in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\". The fair value for fixed-rate debt securities is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments and is classified as Level 2. The fair value for the Company's other borrowings primarily under commercial paper and the 2027 Term Loan equals the carrying value and is classified as Level 2. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of total borrowings was $ 4,888 million and $ 5,737 million, respectively. The Company had no borrowings classified as Level 1 or Level 3 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nSubsequent Action \n\nIn January 2023, the Company borrowed $ 300 million under a delayed draw two-year term loan (the \"2024 Term Loan\"), which was executed in fourth quarter 2022. Borrowings under the 2024 Term Loan are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates. The 2024 Term Loan contains the same customary covenants and events of default, including maintenance of certain financial ratios, as the Credit Facility, with payment of customary fees. \n\n10. DERIVATIVE AND NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\nOverview of Hedging Programs \n\nEastman is exposed to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. To mitigate these market risks and their effects on the cash flows of the underlying transactions and investments in foreign subsidiaries, the Company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, when appropriate, in accordance with the Company's hedging strategy and policies. Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nCash flow hedges are derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk. The derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The change in the hedge instrument is reported as a component of AOCI located in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Cash flows from \n\ncash flow hedges are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Hedging &#160; \n\nEastman manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets. To manage the remaining exposure, the Company enters into currency option and forward cash flow hedges to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro). Additionally, the Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contract cash flow hedges to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. \n\nIn fourth quarter 2022, the Company de-designated and monetized certain forward cash flow hedges. The resulting unrealized gain of $ 27 million was recorded in AOCI and will be recognized in earnings in 2023 through 2025 as the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nCommodity Hedging \n\nCertain raw material and energy sources used by Eastman, as well as sales of certain commodity products by the Company, are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply and demand conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable factors. This volatility is primarily related to the market pricing of benzene, ethane, ethylene, natural gas, paraxylene, and propane. In order to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices, from time to time, the Company enters into option and forward contracts and designates these contracts as cash flow hedges. The Company currently hedges commodity price risks using derivative financial instrument transactions within a rolling three year period. The Company weights its hedge portfolio more heavily in the first year with declining coverage over the remaining periods. \n\nInterest Rate Hedging &#160; \n\nEastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. To manage interest rate risk effectively, the Company, from time to time, enters into cash flow interest rate derivative instruments, primarily forward starting swaps and treasury locks, to hedge the Company's exposure to movements in interest rates prior to anticipated debt offerings. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. \n\nIn 2022, the Company settled the notional amount of $ 75 million associated with the 2022 forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a cash gain of $ 13 million which is included as part of operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The recognized gain from cash flow hedges of $ 1 million is included within \"Net interest expense\" on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings and the unrecognized gain of $ 12 million from cash flow hedges is included in AOCI on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. \n\nFair Value Hedges \n\nFair value hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. The derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are reported as \"Long-term borrowings\" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated fair value of the underlying exposures being hedged. The net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying fair value hedges is recognized in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Cash flows from fair value hedges are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nInterest Rate Hedging &#160; \n\nEastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. To manage the Company's mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, from time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. These swaps are designated as hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt obligations and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps. \n\nNet Investment Hedges \n\nNet investment hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. The net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying net investment hedges is reported as a component of the \"Cumulative Translation Adjustment\" (\"CTA\") within AOCI located in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Cash flows from the CTA component are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recognized in CTA is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. In the event of a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment, cash flows from net investment hedges are classified as investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nFor derivative cross-currency interest rate swap net investment hedges, gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in CTA within AOCI and recognized in earnings through the periodic swap interest accruals. The cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges are included as part of \"Other long-term liabilities\", \"Other noncurrent assets\", \"Payables and other current liabilities\", or \"Other current assets\" within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Cash flows from excluded components are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nIn 2022, the Company terminated fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps designated to hedge a portion of its net investment in a euro functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations. The notional amount terminated was &#8364; 266 million ($ 320 million) which was scheduled to mature in August 2022. The termination resulted in a $ 40 million gain recognized in CTA. The related cash flows were classified as investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nSummary of Financial Position and Financial Performance of Hedging Instruments \n\nThe following table presents the notional amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 associated with Eastman's hedging programs. ##TABLE_START Notional Outstanding December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges: Foreign Exchange Forward and Option Contracts (in millions) EUR/USD (in EUR) &#8364; 573 &#8364; 429 Commodity Forward and Collar Contracts Feedstock (in million barrels) &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Energy (in million british thermal units) 3 &#160; 13 &#160; Interest rate swaps for the future issuance of debt (in millions) &#8212; $ 75 Derivatives designated as fair value hedges: Fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps (in millions) $ 75 $ 75 Derivatives designated as net investment hedges: Cross-currency interest rate swaps (in millions) EUR/USD (in EUR) &#8364; 587 &#8364; 853 Non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges: Foreign Currency Net Investment Hedges (in millions) EUR/USD (in EUR) &#8364; 1,247 &#8364; 1,246 ##TABLE_END \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nFor additional information on fair value measurement, see Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\". \n\nAll the Company's derivative assets and liabilities are currently classified as Level 2. Level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. These standard pricing models use inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. The fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party. In addition, on an ongoing basis, the Company tests a subset of its valuations against valuations received from the counterparties to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models. The Company had no derivatives classified as Level 1 or Level 3 as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the Company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance and the Company diversifies its positions among such counterparties to reduce its exposure to counterparty risk and credit losses. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties on an ongoing basis. The Company did not realize a credit loss during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nAll the Company's derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, which provide for the option to settle contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day and in the same currency. In addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. The Company does not have any cash collateral due under such agreements. \n\nThe Company presents derivative contracts on a gross basis within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table presents the financial assets and liabilities valued on a recurring and gross basis and includes where the financial assets and liabilities are located within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. ##TABLE_START The Financial Position and Fair Value Measurements of Hedging Instruments on a Gross Basis (Dollars in millions) &#160; Derivative Type Statements of Financial Position Location December 31, 2022 Level 2 December 31, 2021 Level 2 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges: &#160; &#160; &#160; Commodity contracts Other current assets $ 3 &#160; $ 16 &#160; Commodity contracts Other noncurrent assets &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts Other current assets &#8212; &#160; 12 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts Other noncurrent assets &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; Forward starting interest rate swap contracts Other current assets &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Derivatives designated as fair value hedges: Fixed-for-floating interest rate swap Other current assets 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Fixed-for-floating interest rate swap Other noncurrent assets &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Derivatives designated as net investment hedges: Cross-currency interest rate swaps Other current assets &#8212; &#160; 20 &#160; Cross-currency interest rate swaps Other noncurrent assets 72 &#160; 35 &#160; Total Derivative Assets $ 76 &#160; $ 98 &#160; Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges: Commodity contracts Payables and other current liabilities $ 3 &#160; $ 1 &#160; Commodity contracts Other long-term liabilities &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts Payables and other current liabilities 8 &#160; 1 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts Other long-term liabilities 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Derivatives designated as fair value hedges: Fixed-for-floating interest rate swap Long-term borrowings 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Derivatives designated as net investment hedges: Cross-currency interest rate swaps Other long-term liabilities &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Total Derivative Liabilities $ 20 &#160; $ 8 &#160; Total Net Derivative Assets (Liabilities) &#160; $ 56 &#160; $ 90 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nIn addition to the fair value associated with derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, and net investment hedges noted in the table above, the Company had a carrying value of $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion associated with non-derivative instruments designated as foreign currency net investment hedges as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company recognized a net loss of $ 11 million in 2022, no gain or loss in 2021, and a net loss of $ 1 million in 2020 on these derivatives. \n\nPre-tax monetized positions and MTM gains and losses from raw materials and energy, currency, and certain interest rate hedges that were included in AOCI included gains of $ 134 million at December 31, 2022 and losses of $ 7 million at December 31, 2021. Gains in AOCI in 2022 compared to losses in 2021 are primarily as a result of an increase in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro. If realized, approximately $ 10 million in pre-tax gains will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months, including foreign exchange contracts prospectively dedesignated and monetized in fourth quarter 2022. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n11. RETIREMENT PLANS \n\nAs described below, Eastman offers various postretirement benefits to its employees. \n\nDefined Contribution Plans \n\nEastman sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the \"ESOP\"), which is a component of the Eastman Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"EIP/ESOP\"), under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eastman made a contribution in February 2023 to the EIP/ESOP for substantially all U.S. employees equal to 5 percent of their eligible compensation for the 2022 plan year. Employees may allocate contributions to other investment funds within the EIP from the ESOP at any time without restrictions. Allocated shares in the ESOP totaled 1,871,624 ; 1,909,362 ; and 1,997,587 shares as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Dividends on shares held by the EIP/ESOP are charged to retained earnings. All shares held by the EIP/ESOP are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share (\"EPS\"). \n\nIn 2006, the Company amended its EIP/ESOP to provide a Company match of 50 percent of the first 7 percent of an employee's compensation contributed to the plan for employees who are hired on or after January 1, 2007. Employees who are hired on or after January 1, 2007, are also eligible for the contribution to the ESOP as described above. \n\nCharges for domestic contributions to the EIP/ESOP were $ 81 million, $ 73 million, and $ 67 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nPension Plans \n\nEastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. \n\nEffective January 1, 2000, the Company's Eastman Retirement Assistance Plan, a U.S. defined benefit pension plan, was amended. Employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to January 1, 2000 are calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age, years of service, and final average compensation as defined in the plans. The amended plan uses a pension equity formula to calculate an employee's retirement benefits from January 1, 2000 forward. Benefits payable will be the combined pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in Eastman's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. \n\nBenefits are paid to employees from trust funds. Contributions to the trust funds are made as permitted by laws and regulations. The pension trust funds do not directly own any of the Company's common stock. \n\nPension coverage for employees of Eastman's non-U.S. operations is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The Company systematically provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees, under insurance policies, or by book reserves. \n\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nUnder its other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S., Eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007. Eastman provided a subsidy for pre-Medicare health care and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007 that ended on December 31, 2021. Company funding is also provided for eligible Medicare retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. A few of the Company's non-U.S. operations have supplemental health benefit plans for certain retirees, the cost of which is not significant to the Company. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nBelow is a summary balance sheet of the change in plan assets during 2022 and 2021, the funded status of the plans and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. \n\nSummary of Changes ##TABLE_START Pension Plans \n\nPostretirement Benefit Plans 2022 2021 2022 2021 (Dollars in millions) U.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. Change in projected benefit obligation: Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 1,892 &#160; $ 948 &#160; $ 2,050 &#160; $ 1,089 &#160; $ 665 &#160; $ 745 &#160; Service cost 25 &#160; 11 &#160; 26 &#160; 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Interest cost 45 &#160; 14 &#160; 37 &#160; 12 &#160; 14 &#160; 12 &#160; Actuarial gain ( 328 ) ( 264 ) ( 49 ) ( 68 ) ( 127 ) ( 40 ) Curtailment gain &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Settlement ( 9 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 6 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Divestitures &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 32 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) Plan participants' contributions &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 2 &#160; 9 &#160; Effect of currency exchange &#8212; &#160; ( 77 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 43 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Federal subsidy on benefits paid &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Benefits paid ( 154 ) ( 28 ) ( 166 ) ( 30 ) ( 45 ) ( 60 ) Benefit obligation, end of year $ 1,471 &#160; $ 602 &#160; $ 1,892 &#160; $ 948 &#160; $ 509 &#160; $ 665 &#160; Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 1,877 &#160; $ 924 &#160; $ 1,798 &#160; $ 938 &#160; $ 134 &#160; $ 144 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 312 ) ( 250 ) 247 &#160; 31 &#160; ( 31 ) 7 &#160; Effect of currency exchange &#8212; &#160; ( 76 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 39 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Company contributions 3 &#160; 18 &#160; 4 &#160; 23 &#160; 35 &#160; 40 &#160; Reserve for third party contributions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11 &#160; ( 7 ) Plan participants' contributions &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 2 &#160; 9 &#160; Benefits paid ( 154 ) ( 28 ) ( 166 ) ( 30 ) ( 45 ) ( 60 ) Federal subsidy on benefits paid &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Settlements ( 9 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 6 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ 1,405 &#160; $ 589 &#160; $ 1,877 &#160; $ 924 &#160; $ 106 &#160; $ 134 &#160; Funded status at end of year $ ( 66 ) $ ( 13 ) $ ( 15 ) $ ( 24 ) $ ( 403 ) $ ( 531 ) Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position consist of: Other noncurrent assets $ &#8212; &#160; $ 23 &#160; $ 41 &#160; $ 42 &#160; $ 53 &#160; $ 62 &#160; Current liabilities ( 13 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 38 ) ( 38 ) Post-employment obligations ( 53 ) ( 36 ) ( 53 ) ( 66 ) ( 418 ) ( 555 ) Net amount recognized, end of year $ ( 66 ) $ ( 13 ) $ ( 15 ) $ ( 24 ) $ ( 403 ) $ ( 531 ) Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,417 &#160; $ 578 &#160; $ 1,803 &#160; $ 910 &#160; Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income consist of: Prior service (credit) cost $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 6 ) $ 1 &#160; $ ( 10 ) $ ( 37 ) $ ( 68 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nActuarial gains in the projected benefit obligations for 2022 were primarily due to higher discount rates partially offset by changes in actuarial assumptions.

A curtailment gain of $ 7 million, including $ 3 million reduction in the pension benefit obligation and $ 4 million of prior service credits recognized immediately, and a MTM gain of $ 3 million were recognized in 2022. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nSettlements are triggered in a plan when distributions exceed the sum of service cost and interest cost of the respective plan. Lump sum payments from a U.S. pension plan resulted in a plan settlement in second quarter 2022. The settlement was not material. However, the settlement triggered an interim remeasurement of the impacted U.S. pension plan's assets and liabilities and, as such, the Company recognized a MTM loss of $ 7 million in 2022. \n\nPlan Assumptions \n\nThe assumptions used to develop the projected benefit obligation for Eastman's significant U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans are provided in the following tables. ##TABLE_START Pension Plans Postretirement Benefit Plans 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for years ended December 31: \n\nU.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. Discount rate 5.58 &#160; % 4.27 &#160; % 2.88 &#160; % 1.57 &#160; % 2.48 &#160; % 1.08 &#160; % 5.55 &#160; % 2.83 &#160; % 2.38 &#160; % Interest crediting rate 5.48 &#160; % N/A 5.50 &#160; % N/A 5.50 &#160; % N/A N/A N/A N/A Rate of compensation increase 3.00 &#160; % 3.04 &#160; % 3.00 &#160; % 3.00 &#160; % 2.75 &#160; % 2.94 &#160; % N/A N/A N/A Health care cost trend Initial 6.00 &#160; % 6.00 &#160; % 6.25 &#160; % Decreasing to ultimate trend of 5.00 &#160; % 5.00 &#160; % 5.00 &#160; % in year 2030 2026 2026 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost for years ended December 31: \n\nU.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. Discount rate 2.88 &#160; % 1.57 &#160; % 2.48 &#160; % 1.08 &#160; % 3.25 &#160; % 1.56 &#160; % 2.83 &#160; % 2.39 &#160; % 3.21 &#160; % Discount rate for service cost 2.95 &#160; % 1.31 &#160; % 2.57 &#160; % 1.08 &#160; % 3.31 &#160; % 1.56 &#160; % N/A 1.90 &#160; % 2.92 &#160; % Discount rate for interest cost 2.46 &#160; % 1.57 &#160; % 1.79 &#160; % 1.08 &#160; % 2.83 &#160; % 1.56 &#160; % 2.35 &#160; % 1.74 &#160; % 2.80 &#160; % Expected return on assets 7.07 &#160; % 3.81 &#160; % 7.29 &#160; % 4.04 &#160; % 7.37 &#160; % 4.26 &#160; % 3.50 &#160; % 3.75 &#160; % 3.75 &#160; % Rate of compensation increase 3.00 &#160; % 3.00 &#160; % 2.75 &#160; % 2.94 &#160; % 3.25 &#160; % 2.94 &#160; % N/A N/A 3.25 &#160; % Interest crediting rate 5.50 &#160; % N/A 5.50 &#160; % N/A 5.52 &#160; % N/A N/A N/A N/A Health care cost trend Initial 6.00 &#160; % 6.25 &#160; % 6.50 &#160; % Decreasing to ultimate trend of 5.00 &#160; % 5.00 &#160; % 5.00 &#160; % in year 2026 2026 2026 ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company calculates service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. \n\nThe fair value of plan assets for the U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.9 billion, respectively, while the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for non-U.S. pension plans was $ 589 million and $ 924 million, respectively.

Non-U.S. primarily consists of annuity contracts and alternative investments. \n\nInvestment Strategy \n\nEastman's investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to meet or exceed the plan's actuarially assumed long-term rate of return and to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. A periodic asset/liability study is conducted in order to assist in the determination and, if necessary, modification of the appropriate long-term investment policy for the plan. The investment policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the fund is managed within those ranges. The plans use a number of investment approaches including investments in equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. The plans also invest in private equity and other funds. Diversification is created through investments across various asset classes, geographies, fund managers, and individual securities. This investment process is designed to provide for a well-diversified portfolio with no significant concentration of risk. The investment process is monitored by an investment committee that includes senior management. \n\nEastman's investment strategy for its VEBA trust is to invest in intermediate-term, well diversified, high quality investment instruments, with a primary objective of capital preservation. \n\nThe expected rate of return for all plans was determined primarily by modeling the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments held by the plans and the targeted allocation percentage against various potential economic scenarios. \n\nThe Company made no contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2022 or 2021. For 2023 calendar year, there are no minimum required cash contributions for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n\nBenefit payments are made using a combination of plan assets and cash payments. Most of the Company's pension plans have plan assets that predominately cover pension benefit obligations. The estimated future benefit payments, reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows: ##TABLE_START Pension Plans Postretirement Benefit Plans (Dollars in millions) U.S. Non-U.S. 2023 $ 230 &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ 47 &#160; 2024 123 &#160; 26 &#160; 47 &#160; 2025 122 &#160; 28 &#160; 47 &#160; 2026 121 &#160; 31 &#160; 46 &#160; 2027 126 &#160; 35 &#160; 45 &#160; 2028-2032 604 &#160; 187 &#160; 208 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n12. LEASES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS \n\nLeases \n\nThere are two types of leases: financing and operating. Both types of leases have associated right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that are valued at the net present value of the lease payments and recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The discount rate used in the measurement of a right-to-use asset and lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used. The Company elected the accounting policy not to apply the recognition and measurement requirements to short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less and do not include a bargain purchase option. \n\nThe Company has operating leases, as a lessee, with customary terms that do not include: significant variable lease payments; significant reasonably certain extensions or options required to be included in the lease term; restrictions; or other covenants for real property, rolling stock, and machinery and equipment. Real property leases primarily consist of office space and rolling stock leases primarily for railcars and fleet vehicles. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, right-to-use assets for operating leases totaled $ 211 million and $ 216 million , respectively, are included as a part of \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the operating right-to-use assets include $ 3 million of assets previously classified as lease intangibles and $ 6 million and $ 5 million of prepaid lease assets, respectively. Operating lease liabilities are included as a part of \"Payables and other current liabilities\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2022, financing leases were not material to the Company's financial statements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, reconciliation of lease payments and operating lease liabilities is provided below: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Operating lease liabilities 2023 $ 58 &#160; 2024 46 &#160; 2025 37 &#160; 2026 26 &#160; 2027 17 &#160; 2028 and beyond 38 &#160; Total lease payments 222 &#160; Less: amounts of lease payments representing interest 20 &#160; Present value of future lease payments 202 &#160; Less: current obligations under leases 52 &#160; Long-term lease obligations $ 150 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nAs of December 31, 2021, reconciliation of lease payments and operating lease liabilities is provided below: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Operating lease liabilities 2022 $ 55 &#160; 2023 44 &#160; 2024 31 &#160; 2025 24 &#160; 2026 18 &#160; 2027 and beyond 53 &#160; Total lease payments 225 &#160; Less: amounts of lease payments representing interest 18 &#160; Present value of future lease payments 207 &#160; Less: current obligations under leases 50 &#160; Long-term lease obligations $ 157 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company has operating leases, primarily leases for railcars, with terms that require the Company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease that will expire beginning third quarter 2023. Residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are recognized as rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease. Management's current expectation is that the likelihood of material residual guarantee payments is remote. \n\nLease costs during the period and other information is provided below: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Lease costs: Operating lease costs $ 67 $ 71 $ 73 Short-term lease costs 45 40 37 Sublease income ( 13 ) ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Total $ 99 $ 107 $ 106 ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Other operating lease information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 67 $ 69 Right-to-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 69 $ 110 Weighted-average remaining lease term, in years 6 6 Weighted-average discount rate 3.2 &#160; % 2.7 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDebt and Other Commitments \n\nEastman's obligations are summarized in the following table. ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Payments Due for Period Debt Securities Credit Facilities and Other Interest Payable Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liabilities Total 2023 $ 800 &#160; $ 326 &#160; $ 180 &#160; $ 166 &#160; $ 58 &#160; $ 207 &#160; $ 1,737 &#160; 2024 241 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 162 &#160; 170 &#160; 46 &#160; 80 &#160; 699 &#160; 2025 693 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 143 &#160; 140 &#160; 37 &#160; 88 &#160; 1,101 &#160; 2026 530 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 131 &#160; 118 &#160; 26 &#160; 86 &#160; 891 &#160; 2027 196 &#160; 499 &#160; 97 &#160; 112 &#160; 17 &#160; 102 &#160; 1,023 &#160; 2028 and beyond 1,866 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,091 &#160; 2,366 &#160; 38 &#160; 912 &#160; 6,273 &#160; Total $ 4,326 &#160; $ 825 &#160; $ 1,804 &#160; $ 3,072 &#160; $ 222 &#160; $ 1,475 &#160; $ 11,724 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nEstimated future payments of debt securities assumes the repayment of principal upon stated maturity, and actual amounts and the timing of such payments may differ materially due to repayment or other changes in the terms of such debt prior to maturity. \n\nEastman had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2022 totaling approximately $ 3.1 billion over a period of approximately 30 years for materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. \n\nAmounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, accrued compensation benefits, environmental loss contingency estimates, uncertain tax liabilities, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the \"2028 and beyond\" line item. \n\nThe amount and timing of pension and other postretirement benefit payments included in other liabilities is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Excess contributions are periodically made by management in order to keep the plans' funded status above 80 percent under the funding provisions of the Pension Protection Act to avoid partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payment. The Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans are not currently under any benefit restrictions. See Note 11, \"Retirement Plans\", for more information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. \n\nThe resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters included in other liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See \"Environmental Costs\" in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\", and see Note 13, \"Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations\", for more information regarding outstanding environmental matters and asset retirement obligations. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nGuarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other parties when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. The Company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating to intellectual property, environmental matters, third-party debt, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. These other guarantees have remaining terms up to 15 years with maximum potential future payments of approximately $ 160 million in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees being individually significant to the Company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. Management's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-performance under other guarantees is remote. Eastman utilizes letters of credit to support commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on the Company. \n\n13. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS \n\nCertain Eastman manufacturing facilities generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for certain cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and post-closure under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman's policies described in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies\". The resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in the period recognized. However, because of the availability of legal defenses, the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and the extended period of time that the obligations are expected to be satisfied, management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's future overall financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nEnvironmental Remediation and Environmental Asset Retirement Obligations \n\nThe Company's net environmental reserve for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is included as part of \"Other noncurrent assets\", \"Payables and other current liabilities\", and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 2021 Environmental contingencies, current $ 10 &#160; $ 20 &#160; Environmental contingencies, long-term 264 &#160; 261 &#160; Total $ 274 &#160; $ 281 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nEnvironmental Remediation \n\nEstimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $ 245 million to the maximum of $ 457 million and from the best estimate or minimum of $ 253 million to the maximum of $ 473 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable and include the amounts recognized at December 31, 2022. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nCosts of certain remediation projects included in the environmental reserve are subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with Monsanto Company (\"Monsanto\") under the provisions of the Amended and Restated Settlement Agreement effective February 28, 2008 (the \"Effective Date\"), into which Solutia entered with Monsanto upon its emergence from bankruptcy (the \"Monsanto Settlement Agreement\"). Under the provisions of the Monsanto Settlement Agreement, Solutia, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastman on July 2, 2012, shares responsibility with Monsanto for remediation at certain locations outside of the boundaries of plant sites in Anniston, Alabama and Sauget, Illinois (the \"Shared Sites\"). Solutia is responsible for the funding of environmental liabilities at the Shared Sites up to a total of $ 325 million from the Effective Date. If remediation costs for the Shared Sites exceed this amount, such costs will thereafter be shared equally between Solutia and Monsanto. Including payments by Solutia prior to its acquisition by Eastman, $ 117 million had been paid for costs at the Shared Sites as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, an additional $ 200 million has been recognized for estimated future remediation costs at the Shared Sites, over a period of approximately 30 years. \n\nReserves for environmental remediation include liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years. The amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are recognized in \"Cost of sales\" and \"Other (income) charges, net\" on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. \n\nChanges in the reserves for environmental remediation liabilities during full year 2022 and full year 2021 are summarized below: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Environmental Remediation Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 257 &#160; Changes in estimates recognized in earnings and other 9 &#160; Cash reductions ( 13 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 253 &#160; Changes in estimates recognized in earnings and other 6 &#160; Cash reductions ( 14 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 245 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nEnvironmental Asset Retirement Obligations \n\nAn asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. Environmental asset retirement obligations consist of primarily closure and post-closure costs. For sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate recognized to date for these environmental asset retirement obligation costs was $ 29 million and $ 28 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nOther \n\nEastman's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $ 300 million, $ 281 million, and $ 265 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and include operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, engineering costs, and construction costs. The cash expenditures above include environmental capital expenditures of approximately $ 60 million, $ 38 million, and $ 42 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe Company has contractual asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities. Eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets in Pace, Florida and Oulu, Finland. These non-environmental asset retirement obligations were $ 51 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, and are included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n14. LEGAL MATTERS \n\nFrom time to time, Eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n15.

The Company declared dividends per share of $ 3.07 in 2022, $ 2.83 in 2021, and $ 2.67 in 2020. \n\nIn 1997 the Company established a benefit security trust to provide a degree of financial security for unfunded obligations under certain unfunded plans. A warrant to purchase up to 6 million shares of par value common stock of the Company was contributed to the trust. The warrant, which remains outstanding, is exercisable by the trustee if the Company does not meet certain funding obligations, which obligations would be triggered by certain occurrences, including a change in control or potential change in control, as defined, or failure by the Company to meet its payment obligations under certain covered unfunded plans. Such warrant is excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because the conditions upon which the warrant becomes exercisable have not been met. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nIn February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders (the \"2018 authorization\"). The Company completed the 2018 authorization in May 2022, acquiring a total of 19,915,370 shares. In December 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $ 2.5 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders (the \"2021 authorization\"). As of December 31, 2022, a total of 6,743,883 shares have been repurchased under the 2021 authorization for $ 635 million. Both dividends and share repurchases are key strategies employed by the Company to return value to its stockholders. \n\nIn fourth quarter 2021, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (\"2021 ASR\") to purchase $ 500 million of the Company's common stock under the 2018 authorization. In exchange for upfront payment totaling $500 million, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the 2021 ASR's purchase period, which was settled in first quarter 2022. The total number of shares ultimately delivered was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock during the term of the 2021 ASR, less a discount. Approximately 80 percent of the expected shares repurchased under the 2021 ASR were delivered in fourth quarter 2021 and the remaining shares were delivered in first quarter 2022. \n\nIn second quarter 2022, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (\"2022 ASR\") to purchase $ 500 million of the Company's common stock under the Board approved authorizations. In exchange for upfront payment totaling $ 500 million, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the 2022 ASR's purchase period, which was settled in third quarter 2022. The total number of shares ultimately delivered was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's stock during the term of the 2022 ASR, less a discount. Approximately 80 percent of the expected shares repurchased under the 2022 ASR were delivered in second quarter 2022 and the remaining shares were delivered in third quarter 2022. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company repurchased 10,710,259 shares of common stock for $ 1,102 million, which included $ 100 million from the settlement of the 2021 ASR. During 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased shares of common stock of 8,061,779 and 1,134,052 , respectively, for a cost of approximately $ 900 million and $ 60 million, respectively. \n\nThe Company's charitable foundation held 50,798 issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 which are included in treasury stock in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and excluded from calculations of diluted EPS. \n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS: ##TABLE_START &#160; For years ended December 31, (In millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Numerator Net earnings attributable to Eastman $ 793 &#160; $ 857 &#160; $ 478 &#160; Denominator Weighted average shares used for basic EPS 123.5 &#160; 134.9 &#160; 135.5 &#160; Dilutive effect of stock options and other award plans 1.4 &#160; 2.2 &#160; 1.0 &#160; Weighted average shares used for diluted EPS 124.9 &#160; 137.1 &#160; 136.5 &#160; \n\nEPS (1) \n\nBasic $ 6.42 &#160; $ 6.35 &#160; $ 3.53 &#160; Diluted $ 6.35 &#160; $ 6.25 &#160; $ 3.50 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n(1) EPS is calculated using whole dollars and shares. \n\nShares underlying stock options excluded from the 2022, 2021, and 2020 calculations of diluted EPS were 1,398,110 , 150,781 , and 2,424,826 , respectively, because the grant price of these options was greater than the average market price of the Company's common stock and the effect of including them in the calculation of diluted EPS would have been antidilutive. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nShares of common stock issued, including shares held in treasury, are presented below: ##TABLE_START &#160; For years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year 221,809,309 &#160; 220,641,506 &#160; 219,638,646 &#160; Issued for employee compensation and benefit plans 539,248 &#160; 1,167,803 &#160; 1,002,860 &#160; Balance at end of year 222,348,557 &#160; 221,809,309 &#160; 220,641,506 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ##TABLE_START &#160; (Dollars in millions) Cumulative Translation Adjustment Benefit Plans Unrecognized Prior Service Credits Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges Unrealized Losses on Investments Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Balance at December 31, 2020 $ ( 293 ) $ 87 &#160; $ ( 66 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 273 ) Period change 56 &#160; ( 28 ) 63 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 91 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2021 ( 237 ) 59 &#160; ( 3 ) ( 1 ) ( 182 ) Period change 7 &#160; ( 27 ) ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 23 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 230 ) $ 32 &#160; $ ( 6 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 205 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nAmounts of other comprehensive income (loss) are presented net of applicable taxes.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS AND AWARDS \n\n2021 Omnibus Stock Compensation Plan \n\nEastman's 2021 Omnibus Stock Compensation Plan (\"2021 Omnibus Plan\") was approved by stockholders at the May 6, 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and shall remain in effect until its fifth anniversary. The 2021 Omnibus Plan authorizes the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors to grant awards, designate participants, determine the types and numbers of awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards and determine the form of award settlement. Under the 2021 Omnibus Plan, the aggregate number of shares reserved and available for issuance is 10 million, which consist of shares not previously authorized for issuance under any other plan. The number of shares covered by an award is counted against this share reserve as of the grant date of the award. Shares covered by full value awards (e.g. performance shares and restricted stock awards) are counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the plan as 2.5 shares for every one share covered by the award. Any stock distributed pursuant to an award may consist of, in whole or in part, authorized and unissued stock, treasury stock, or stock purchased on the open market. Under the 2021 Omnibus Plan and previous plans, the forms of awards have included restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), and performance shares. The 2021 Omnibus Plan is flexible as to the number of specific forms of awards, but provides that stock options and SARs are to be granted at an exercise price not less than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the grant . \n\n&#160; \n\nDirector Stock Compensation Subplan \n\nEastman's 2021 Director Stock Compensation Subplan (\"Directors' Subplan\"), a component of the 2021 Omnibus Plan, remains in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors or the earlier termination of the 2021 Omnibus Plan. The Directors' Subplan provides for structured awards of restricted shares to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Restricted shares awarded under the Directors' Subplan are subject to the same terms and conditions of the 2021 Omnibus Plan. The Directors' Subplan does not constitute a separate source of shares for grants of equity awards and all shares awarded are part of the 10 million shares authorized under the 2021 Omnibus Plan. Shares of restricted stock are granted on the first day of a non-employee director's initial term of service and shares of restricted stock are granted each year to each non-employee director on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. \n\nIt has been the Company's practice to issue new shares rather than treasury shares for equity awards for compensation plans, including the 2021 Omnibus Plan and the Directors' Subplan, that require settlement by the issuance of common stock and to withhold or accept back shares awarded to cover the related income tax obligations of employee participants. Shares of unrestricted common stock owned by non-employee directors are not eligible to be withheld or acquired to satisfy the withholding obligation related to their income taxes. Shares of unrestricted common stock owned by specified senior management level employees are accepted by the Company to pay the exercise price of stock options in accordance with the terms and conditions of their awards. \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nCompensation Expense \n\nFor 2022, 2021, and 2020, total share-based compensation expense (before tax) of approximately $ 69 million, $ 70 million, and $ 44 million, respectively, was recognized in \"Selling, general and administrative expense\" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings for all share-based awards of which approximately $ 11 million, $ 9 million, and $ 7 million, respectively, related to stock options. The compensation expense is recognized over the substantive vesting period, which may be a shorter time period than the stated vesting period for qualifying termination eligible employees as defined in the forms of award notice. Approximately $ 7 million for 2022, $ 2 million for 2021, and $ 1 million for 2020 of stock option compensation expense was recognized each year due to qualifying termination eligibility preceding the requisite vesting period. \n\nStock Option Awards \n\nOptions have been granted on an annual basis by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors under the 2021 Omnibus Plan and predecessor plans to employees. Option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. The term of options is 10 years with vesting periods that vary up to three years . Vesting usually occurs ratably over the vesting period or at the end of the vesting period. The Company utilizes the Black Scholes Merton option valuation model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option's fair value. \n\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock options awarded in 2022, 2021, and 2020 are provided in the table below: ##TABLE_START Assumptions 2022 2021 2020 Expected volatility rate 28.98 % 28.99 % 21.56 % Expected dividend yield 2.57 % 3.58 % 3.30 % Average risk-free interest rate 2.35 % 0.95 % 0.94 % Expected term years 6.4 6.0 5.9 ##TABLE_END \n\nThe volatility rate of grants is derived from historical Company common stock price volatility over the same time period as the expected term of each stock option award. The volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing stock price data over the expected term. The expected dividend yield is calculated using the Company's average of the last four quarterly dividend yields . The average risk-free interest rate is derived from United States Department of Treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term. The weighted average expected term reflects the analysis of historical share-based award transactions and includes option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter remaining expected terms than new option grants. \n\nA summary of the activity of the Company's stock option awards for 2022, 2021, and 2020 is presented below: ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; Options Weighted-Average Exercise Price Options Weighted-Average Exercise Price Options Weighted-Average Exercise Price Outstanding at beginning of year 3,168,500 &#160; $ 84 &#160; 3,526,600 &#160; $ 79 &#160; 3,479,300 &#160; $ 80 &#160; Granted 443,100 &#160; 113 &#160; 449,700 &#160; 109 &#160; 622,000 &#160; 62 &#160; Exercised ( 122,700 ) 74 &#160; ( 807,200 ) 77 &#160; ( 568,800 ) 64 &#160; Cancelled, forfeited, or expired ( 9,700 ) 87 &#160; ( 600 ) 74 &#160; ( 5,900 ) 82 &#160; Outstanding at end of year 3,479,200 &#160; $ 88 &#160; 3,168,500 &#160; $ 84 &#160; 3,526,600 &#160; $ 79 &#160; Options exercisable at year-end 2,534,400 &#160; 2,047,500 &#160; 2,192,300 &#160; Available for grant at end of year 8,355,640 &#160; 9,866,480 &#160; 4,046,748 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nThe following table provides the remaining contractual term and weighted average exercise prices of stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START &#160; Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices Number Outstanding at December 31, 2022 Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Weighted-Average Exercise Price Number Exercisable at December 31, 2022 Weighted-Average Exercise Price $61-$75 1,037,200 5.2 $ 65 &#160; 831,800 $ 66 &#160; $76-$90 1,099,700 5.3 82 &#160; 1,018,600 82 &#160; $91-$105 535,800 5.2 104 &#160; 535,800 104 &#160; $106-$121 806,500 8.6 114 &#160; 148,200 109 &#160; &#160; 3,479,200 6.0 $ 88 &#160; 2,534,400 $ 83 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe range of exercise prices of options outstanding at December 31, 2022 is approximately $ 61 to $ 121 per share. The aggregate intrinsic value of total options outstanding and total options exercisable at December 31, 2022 is $ 17 million and $ 13 million, respectively. Intrinsic value is the amount by which the closing market price of the stock at December 31, 2022 exceeds the exercise price of the option grants. \n\nThe weighted average remaining contractual life of all exercisable options at December 31, 2022 is 5.1 years. \n\nThe weighted average fair value of options granted during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 26.80 , $ 19.81 , and $ 7.92 , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was $ 6 million, $ 31 million, and $ 14 million, respectively. Cash proceeds received by the Company from option exercises totaled $ 10 million with a related tax benefit of $ 1 million, respectively, for 2022, $ 62 million with a related tax benefit of $ 5 million, respectively, for 2021, and $ 36 million with a related tax benefit of $ 2 million, respectively, for 2020. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 8 million, $ 8 million, and $ 9 million, respectively. \n\nA summary of the changes in the Company's nonvested options during the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented below: ##TABLE_START Nonvested Options Number of Options Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested at January 1, 2022 1,121,000 &#160; $ 13.88 Granted 443,100 &#160; $ 26.80 Vested ( 611,900 ) $ 12.99 Cancelled, forfeited, or expired ( 7,400 ) $ 14.90 Nonvested options at December 31, 2022 944,800 &#160; $ 20.50 ##TABLE_END \n\nFor nonvested options at December 31, 2022, approximately $ 3 million in compensation expense will be recognized over the next two years . \n\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nOther Share-Based Compensation Awards \n\nIn addition to stock option awards, Eastman has awarded long-term performance share awards, restricted stock awards, and SARs. The long-term performance share awards are based upon actual return on capital compared to a target return on capital and total stockholder return compared to a peer group ranking by total stockholder return over a three year performance period. The awards are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation based model and vest pro-rata over the three year performance period. The number of long-term performance award target shares granted for the 2022-2024, 2021-2023, and 2020-2022 periods were 288 thousand, 311 thousand, and 423 thousand, respectively. The target shares granted are assumed to be 100 percent. At the end of the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares awarded can range from zero percent to 250 percent of the target shares granted based on the award notice. The number of restricted stock awards granted during 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 160 thousand, 166 thousand, and 227 thousand, respectively.

      "text": " ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nEastman maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nManagement necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. Management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance; judgments in decision-making can be faulty; and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and while the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected. \n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nThe Company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and acquisitions and dispositions of assets of the Company; \n\n&#8226; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and \n\n&#8226; Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\n"
