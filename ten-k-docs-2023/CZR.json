      "text": " Item 1. Business \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018 and a merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (&#8220;Former Caesars&#8221;) on July 20, 2020, pursuant to which Former Caesars became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) and our ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market changed from &#8220;ERI&#8221; to &#8220;CZR&#8221;. In addition, on April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC (the &#8220;William Hill Acquisition&#8221;). \n\nOur primary source of revenue is generated by casino properties&#8217; gaming operations, including retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming, and we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we own, lease or manage an aggregate of 51 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 52,800 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,800 table games and approximately 47,200 hotel rooms. We also operate and conduct sports wagering across 28 jurisdictions in North America, 20 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operate regulated online real money gaming in six jurisdictions in North America. We continue to expand into additional markets as jurisdictions legalize forms of retail and online gaming and sports betting. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. We lease certain real property assets from third parties, including GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (&#8220;GLPI&#8221;) and VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (&#8220;VICI&#8221;). See Item 2, &#8220;Properties,&#8221; for more information about our properties. \n\nSignificant Transactions in 2022 \n\nOn April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for &#163;2.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion with the intent to divest William Hill PLC&#8217;s non-U.S. operations, which included the United Kingdom and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, &#8220;William Hill International&#8221;). We entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately &#163;2.2 billion which, on April 7, 2022, we amended for a revised enterprise value of approximately &#163;2.0 billion. The amended agreement reflected a &#163;250 million reduction in consideration payable at closing and up to &#163;100 million of deferred consideration to be paid to Caesars, subject to 888 Holdings Plc meeting certain 2023 financial targets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairments to assets held for sale of $503 million within discontinued operations based on the revised and final sales prices. \n\nOn July 1, 2022, we completed the sale of William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc and outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement, between the Company and certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as administrative agent and collateral agent, were immediately repaid. After the repayment of the Bridge Credit Agreement, other permitted leakage, and the settlement of related forward contracts, we received net proceeds of $730 million. Including open market repurchases and repayments, we utilized all $730 million to reduce our outstanding debt. \n\nOn May 5, 2022, we consummated the sale of the equity interests of Belle of Baton Rouge Casino &#38; Hotel (&#8220;Baton Rouge&#8221;) to CQ Holding Company, Inc., subject to customary closing conditions, resulting in a loss of $3 million. Baton Rouge was within the Regional segment. \n\nDevelopments related to COVID-19 \n\nDespite the resurgence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant at the beginning of the year, operations at many of our properties experienced positive trends during much of the year ended December 31, 2022, including higher hotel occupancy, particularly in Las Vegas, and increased gaming and food and beverage volumes. The reduction in mandates and restrictions, combined with pent up consumer demand and supplemental discretionary spend from governmental stimulus, resulted in strong results across our properties during 2021. Future variants, mandates or restrictions imposed by various regulatory bodies are uncertain and could have a significant impact on our future operations. \n\nBusiness Operations \n\nOur consolidated business is composed of complementary businesses that reinforce, cross-promote, and build upon each other: casino, which includes our online sports betting and iGaming, food and beverage, hotel, casino management services, entertainment, retail and other business operations. \n\nCasino Operations \n\nOur casino operations generate revenues from approximately 52,800 slot machines, 2,800 table games, including poker, sports betting from our retail and online sportsbooks, iGaming and other games such as keno, all of which comprised approximately 55% of our total net revenues in 2022. Slot revenues generate the majority of our casino revenues. \n\nOnline Sports Betting and iGaming \n\nAs a result of our acquisition of William Hill PLC on April 22, 2021, we significantly expanded our online sports betting and iGaming presence. We operate and conduct sports wagering across 28 jurisdictions in North America as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, we operate regulated online real money gaming businesses in six jurisdictions in North America and continue to leverage the World Series of Poker (&#8220;WSOP&#8221;) brand, and license the WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and services. We offer hundreds of online casino games including slots, table games, live dealer and video poker and we expect to increase our product offerings as iGaming is legalized in additional states. \n\nExtensive usage of digital platforms, continued legalization in additional jurisdictions, and growing bettor demand are driving the market for online sports betting platforms in the United States and the William Hill Acquisition positioned us to address this growing market. \n\nOn August 2, 2021, we launched our Caesars Sportsbook app on our owned and integrated technology platform we have labeled Liberty (&#8220;Liberty&#8221;). We launched a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and media personalities promoting the launch of the Caesars Sportsbook app. The app offers extensive pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Caesars Sportsbook has partnerships with the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and several individual teams, while being the exclusive odds provider for ESPN and CBS Sports. We have continued to create new partnerships among professional sports teams and, in 2021, entered into a 20-year exclusive naming-rights partnership branding the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. In addition to the Caesars Sportsbook app, the Company and NYRABets LLC, the official online wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, Inc., launched the Caesars Racebook app. The Caesars Racebook app operates in eight states and provides access for pari-mutuel wagering at over 300 racetracks around the world as well as livestreaming of races. Wagers placed can earn credits towards the Caesars Rewards loyalty program or points which can be redeemed for free wagering credits. Growth in the Caesars Digital segment continues to be realized with the strategic expansion into new states as jurisdictions legalize retail and online sports betting and online horse race wagering. \n\nSports Brand Partnerships &#8212; Our strategy includes developing local and national partnerships that align our sportsbooks, casinos, resorts and brands with sports fans. We have high-profile exclusive sports entertainment partnerships with the NFL, making Caesars the first-ever &#8220;Official Casino Sponsor&#8221; in the history of the league. This historic partnership combines the NFL&#8217;s legendary events with our properties to bring unique experiences to Caesars&#8217; patrons. This includes exclusive rights to use NFL trademarks to promote our properties and enabling Caesars to host exclusive special events and experiences. Caesars expects to continue to host brand activations at prominent, high-profile NFL events, including the NFL Draft, NFL playoffs, and the Super Bowl during this multi-year partnership. \n\nFood and Beverage Operations \n\nOur food and beverage operations generate revenues from our dining venues, bars, nightclubs, and lounges located throughout our casinos and represented approximately 15% of our total net revenues in 2022. Many of our properties include several dining options, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately-priced restaurants, some of which offer pickup or in-room delivery options. \n\nHotel Operations \n\nHotel operations generate revenues from hotel stays at our properties in our approximately 47,200 guest rooms and suites worldwide and represented approximately 18% of our total net revenues in 2022. Our properties operate at various price and service points, allowing us to host a variety of casino guests, who are visiting our properties for gaming and other casino entertainment options, and non-casino guests who are visiting our properties for other purposes, such as vacation travel or conventions. \n\nManagement and Branding Arrangements \n\nWe earn revenue from fees paid for the management of domestic and international hotels and casinos. Managed properties represent Caesars-branded properties where we provide certain staffing and management services under management agreements. In addition, we authorize the use of certain brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc from which we earn revenue from fees received based on the arrangements. \n\nEntertainment and Other Non-Gaming Operations \n\nWe provide a variety of retail and entertainment offerings at our properties. We operate various entertainment venues across the United States, including the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood. These award-winning entertainment venues host or have announced plans to host, prominent headliners, such as Garth Brooks, Sting, Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert. \n\nThe LINQ Promenade is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail development located between The LINQ Hotel &#38; Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas, which features The High Roller, a 550-foot observation wheel, and Fly LINQ, the first and only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip. The retail stores offer guests a wide range of options from high-end brands and accessories to souvenirs and decorative items. \n\nCAESARS FORUM is a 550,000 square-foot state-of-the-art conference center located at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. CAESARS FORUM can accommodate more than 10,000 participants and features more than 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space, the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world, a LEED silver-rated FORUM Plaza, and the first 100,000 square-foot outdoor meeting and event space in Las Vegas. \n\nMarket Activities \n\nTrends \n\nEconomic Factors Impacting Discretionary Spending &#8212; Gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures which may be sensitive to economic downturns. The resurgence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 continued to impact the beginning of the year, however, many of our properties experienced positive trends during much of the year ended December 31, 2022 including higher hotel occupancy and rates, particularly in Las Vegas, and increased gaming and food and beverage volumes coupled with improved product mix. During 2021, mandates and restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased, discretionary consumer spending was supplemented via governmental stimulus, and pent-up consumer demand from the prolonged impact of COVID-19 resulted in strong results across our properties. \n\nWe continue to monitor the effects of recent inflation and the possible implications on certain customers most affected by lower discretionary income. Although we have seen periods of reduced visitation from those customers, visitation from customers who are not as affected by inflation remains steady or has slightly improved. In addition, our leases with VICI are impacted by inflation as they are subject to annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index (&#8220;CPI&#8221;). \n\nWe are also continuing to monitor rising interest rates which have a direct impact on certain of our debt instruments, in addition to an effect on consumer spending. We evaluate projected changes in interest rates when entering into borrowing arrangements and manage our mix of fixed versus variable debt. \n\nWe continue to manage the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on the economy, our industry and our Company, with challenges arising at times from labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, increased costs of goods and services, among other impacts. Further discussion of the effects of these trends are described throughout this Form 10-K. The extent and duration of these trends is uncertain and may intensify. \n\nOnline Betting and Gaming &#8212; Online betting and gaming is a rapidly developing sector of the e-commerce industry and we believe the digital segment of the global betting and gaming industry will continue to grow in popularity and consumer confidence. The market for online betting platforms is being driven by the increased use of digital processes and global, growing bettor demand. We anticipate that the United States market will begin to have a strong and steady uptake in active \n\nwagers as state-by-state legislation in the United States continues to evolve resulting in new opportunities in the United States sports betting market. The extent and future effects of online betting and gaming on our casino properties is uncertain but we expect that our online betting and gaming offering will be complementary to our brick-and-mortar casino business. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. In most regions, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. In Las Vegas, our largest jurisdiction, competition is expected to increase in the coming years. In response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. There have also been proposals for other large scale gaming and non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. Our Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other. \n\nIn recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing facilities, developing or rebranding new casinos or complementary facilities, and acquiring established facilities. These reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas. The expansion of properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive issues. \n\nOur properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. While the competitive impact on operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes. In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers. These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive. \n\nWe also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-track and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals, and card parlors. Our non-gaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues. Internet gaming and sports betting also create additional competition for our brick-and-mortar operations. \n\nWe face significant competition in our online sports betting, online horse racing wagering and iGaming businesses in jurisdictions where we currently operate and those jurisdictions in which we wish to expand. Although we have experienced recent success in obtaining approval for sports betting and iGaming licenses in new jurisdictions, new state launches may require significant upfront investment and may not be successful. \n\nResources Material to Business \n\nRewards Programs \n\nWe believe Caesars Rewards, with a network of more than 60 million people, enables us to compete more effectively and capture a larger share of our customers&#8217; entertainment spending when they travel among regions or engage in online wagering and gaming versus that of a standalone property, which is core to our cross-market strategy. \n\nCaesars Rewards members earn Reward Credits for qualifying gaming activities, including sports betting, online gaming and wagering in the Caesars Sportsbook and Caesars Racebook apps. Members also earn Reward Credits for qualifying hotel, dining and retail spending at all Caesars Entertainment destinations in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Reward Credits are earned when members use their Caesars Rewards VISA credit card or make a purchase through a Caesars Rewards partner. Members can redeem their earned Reward Credits for those same experiences. \n\nCaesars Rewards is a tier based loyalty program (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Diamond Plus, Diamond Elite or Seven Stars), each with increasing benefits and privileges. Members are provided promotional offers based on their tier level, their retail and gaming engagement at Caesars Entertainment destinations, and their preferred spending choices outside of gaming. Member information is also used in connection with various marketing promotions, including campaigns involving direct mail, email, our websites, mobile devices, social media, and interactive slot machines. \n\nIntellectual Property and Resources \n\nWe use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have the rights necessary to conduct our continuing operations. The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. We regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. We file applications for and obtain patents, trademarks and copyrights in the United States and foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, or copyright, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. Our United States patents have varying expiration dates. \n\nWe have not applied for the registration of all of our trademarks, copyrights, proprietary technology, or other intellectual property rights, as the case may be, and may not be successful in obtaining all intellectual property rights for which we have applied. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe upon our intellectual property and use information that we regard as proprietary, and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great of an extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. \n\nWe own or have the right to use proprietary rights to a number of trademarks that we consider, along with the associated name recognition, to be valuable to our business, including Eldorado, Silver Legacy, Isle, Lady Luck, Tropicana, Circus Circus, Caesars, Flamingo, Harrah&#8217;s, Horseshoe, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Caesars Rewards, Caesars Sportsbook, William Hill and WSOP. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Caesars Sportsbook app is powered by our Liberty platform in 20 mobile sports betting jurisdictions. The Liberty platform resulted in a significant upgrade to our user interface and significant product upgrades including numerous pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Our Liberty platform also integrates customers with the Caesars Rewards loyalty program. We continue to use legacy sportsbook and iGaming platforms in certain states. In addition to the Caesars Sportsbook app, we and NYRABets LLC, the official online wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, Inc., launched the Caesars Racebook app. The Caesars Racebook app provides access for pari-mutuel wagering at over 300 racetracks around the world. Wagers placed can earn credits towards the Caesars Rewards loyalty program. \n\nIndustry Overview \n\nSee Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; See also Exhibit 99.1, &#8220;Gaming Overview,&#8221; to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\nSeasonality \n\nWe believe that business at our regional properties outside of Las Vegas is subject to seasonality, including seasonality based on the weather in the region in which they operate and the travel habits of visitors. Business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, particularly when a holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year, the timing of the WSOP tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, large sporting events or concerts, or visits by our premium players. We also believe that any seasonality, holiday, or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently. We may also experience seasonality with retail and online sports betting which coincides with certain sporting events, as well as seasons of professional sports teams. \n\nGaming Licenses and Governmental Regulations \n\nThe gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and characters of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted. Gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us. \n\nSome jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. \n\nUnder provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities. \n\nA more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\nInternal Revenue Service Regulations \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service requires operators of casinos and online sports betting apps located in the United States to file information returns for U.S. citizens, including names and addresses of winners for certain table games, keno, bingo, slot machine and retail and online sports betting winnings in excess of stipulated amounts. The Internal Revenue Service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some table games, keno, bingo, slot machine and retail and online sports betting winnings of nonresident aliens. We are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements, if extended, might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of, and/or income from, other games. \n\nRegulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (&#8220;FINCEN&#8221;) requires the reporting of currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. This reporting obligation began in May 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the United States which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations. In addition to currency transaction reporting requirements, suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to FINCEN. \n\nOther Laws and Regulations \n\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. \n\nThe sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations. \n\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for additional discussion. \n\nTaxation \n\nGaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to air quality, indoor air quality, water quality, bulk storage of regulated materials, and disposal of waste, including hazardous waste. Such laws and regulations can impose liability on potentially responsible parties (owner/operators of real property) to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning up, sites at which regulated materials were disposed of or released. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws and regulations, we could face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance, contamination or exposure to hazardous conditions. Environmental regulatory violations also include monetary penalties assessed by the \n\njurisdictional regulatory agency and civil or criminal penalties for intentional negligence. Occasionally and under certain circumstances, we have investigated and remediated (or contributed to remediation costs) contamination located at or near our facilities. Examples included contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain facilities are located. In addition, we have and continue to contain, manage, and dispose of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations; manage, abate, or remove indoor air quality concerns such as mold, lead, or asbestos-containing materials; and manage operations within applicable environmental permitting requirements. Although we have incurred and expect to incur costs related to various environmental matters such as investigations, remediation, and management of hazardous materials or conditions known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, such matters in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nClimate Change \n\nThere has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;), including carbon emissions, and climate change issues. The United States is a member of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (&#8220;COP 21&#8221;) in Paris, that set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Paris Agreement requires set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Stronger GHG emission targets were set at COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021. \n\nFuture regulation could impose stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. The current Administration has taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement or estimate. \n\nBeyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change &#8211; such as property damage or supply chain issues stemming from extreme weather events &#8211; has already and may continue to directly affect our facilities and operations. Caesars recognizes the impacts of climate change and is engaged in long-term initiatives to identify, assess, and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change (see &#8220;Environmental Stewardship&#8221; below). \n\nReporting and Record-Keeping Requirements \n\nWe are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries that gaming authorities may require. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may, and in certain jurisdictions do, require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws. \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nWe aim to provide a workplace that is engaging, empowering, inclusive and respectful for all employees (our &#8220;Team Members&#8221;), embracing a culture of openness, passion for service and recognition. Our ongoing investment in professional training and development, safety, health and wellbeing, and Team Member recognition linked to guest satisfaction are all important drivers of our success in delivering strong financial results and creating value for our communities. We have approximately 49,000 employees at our domestic properties throughout our organization. \n\nLabor Relations \n\nApproximately 21,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries. The majority of these employees in various job positions are covered by the following agreements: \n\n##TABLE_START Employee Group Approximate Number of Active Employees Represented Union Date on which Collective Bargaining Agreement Becomes Amendable Las Vegas Culinary Employees 10,000 Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 May 31, 2023 Atlantic City Food &#38; Beverage and Hotel Employees 2,700 UNITE HERE, Local 54 May 31, 2026 Las Vegas Dealers 2,000 United Auto Workers September 30, 2023 Las Vegas Teamsters 1,200 Teamsters, Local 986 March 31, 2024 Las Vegas Bartenders 1,100 Bartenders Union, Local 165 May 31, 2023 ##TABLE_END\n\nHiring and Development \n\nWe aim to support Team Members throughout their career with Caesars. We&#8217;re committed to providing opportunities to help Team Members achieve their professional goals. We maintain a wide range of channels for diverse recruiting, including outreach to academic institutions and nonprofits that help us source diverse candidates. Our leadership receives training on our inclusive and equitable talent management recruitment and retention processes. Additionally, to support hiring initiatives across the enterprise, we maintain a recruiting website that includes information describing our culture, benefits and diversity initiatives. The website highlights our commitment to corporate social responsibility (&#8220;CSR&#8221;) diversity, equity and inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;), and we welcome candidates from all backgrounds. \n\nWe strive to inspire our Team Members through our mission, vision and values, and our Code of Commitment (described below). To evaluate our Team Member experience and our retention efforts, we monitor a number of Team Member measures, such as turnover rates and Team Member satisfaction. In 2021, we implemented new Team Member experience surveys to help us further understand the drivers of engagement and areas where we can improve. These surveys are completed on a regular basis alongside additional surveys targeted at specific events within a Team Member cycle, including new hires, anniversary milestones and exit inquiries. \n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate our Team Members. In addition to competitive salaries and wages, we provide a variety of short-term, long-term and incentive-based compensation programs to reward performance relative to key metrics relevant to our business. We offer comprehensive benefit options including, but not limited to, retirement savings plans, health insurance coverage (including medical, mental health, dental, vision and pharmacy), parental leave, educational assistance, training opportunities, company-paid life insurance and an employee assistance program. \n\nWe place utmost importance on creating a safe workplace for our Team Members, embedding procedures so that all our Team Members have the awareness, knowledge and tools to make safe working a habit. \n\nWe also maintain a wellness program to help our Team Members improve their health and wellbeing. This program has demonstrated improved health metrics for participating Team Members and their covered family members helping reduce the cost of healthcare for Team Members and for the Company. Effective in 2022, we consolidated our group health plans and made significant enhancements to our offerings and wellness program including a wide range of affordable options, mental health initiatives and expanded onsite and virtual primary care clinics across the US. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\nWe embrace diversity and aim to create an inclusive working environment that celebrates all our Team Members as individuals. Our diversity, equity and inclusion framework identifies five pillars of activity: advocacy, Team Members, suppliers, communities and guests for a holistic approach to embedding DEI in everything we do. We publish our DEI data in our annual CSR report (described below). \n\nWe set targets to increase the representation of women and people of color in leadership roles (supervisory and above). Our 2025 goals outlined 50% of management roles to be held by women in both the mid-level and senior leadership populations, and 50% of leadership roles to be held by people of color. We also committed to increase the representation of people of color in senior leadership roles by 50%. As of year-end, 45% of mid-level roles and 30% of senior leadership roles in the Company are held by women. Additionally, 43% of leadership roles are held by people of color and the representation of people of color in senior leadership positions has increased by 106%. \n\nCorporate Social Responsibility \n\nCaesars&#8217; Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) and senior executives view CSR as an integral element in the way we do business, with the belief that being a good corporate citizen helps protect the Company against risk, contributes to improved performance and helps foster positive relationships with all those with whom we connect. The Board and our executive management are committed to being an industry leader in CSR (which includes diversity, equity and inclusion, social impact, and environmental sustainability). In 2022, the Board and our leadership continued to engage with our CEO-level external CSR Advisory Board comprised of experts representing DEI, business strategy, academia and investors, and used their guidance to confirm our CSR priorities. These priorities are reflected in our 13th annual CSR report, published in 2022 in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative Standards. \n\nCSR Committee of the Board \n\nCaesars&#8217; Board has a CSR committee that defines the duties and responsibilities of the Board in supporting delivery of our corporate purpose and CSR strategy as well as CSR-related aspects of corporate governance such as Board diversity. \n\nCode of Commitment \n\nCaesars is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and environmental steward through our CSR strategy, PEOPLE PLANET PLAY. This is reflected in our Code of Commitment which is our public pledge to our guests, Team Members, communities, business partners and all those we reach that we will honor the trust they have placed in us through ethical conduct and integrity. We commit to: \n\n&#8226; PEOPLE: Supporting the wellbeing of our Team Members, guests and local communities. \n\n&#8226; PLANET: Taking care of the world we all call home. \n\n&#8226; PLAY: Creating memorable experiences for our guests and leading responsible gaming practices in the industry. \n\nPEOPLE PLANET PLAY Strategy \n\nOur PEOPLE PLANET PLAY strategy defines how we meet the obligations of our Code of Commitment and is aligned with global priorities articulated by the United Nations as the Sustainable Development Goals. PEOPLE PLANET PLAY establishes multi-year targets in key areas of impact, including science-based greenhouse gas emissions-reduction, formally approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (&#8220;SBTi&#8221;), aligning with global best practices on climate change action. In early 2022, we conducted a comprehensive CSR assessment to evaluate our assumptions. We also used the assessment period to review our business transformations following the COVID-19 pandemic, along with expectations related to social justice and CSR. With the help of an external specialist, our assessment gathered input from internal and external stakeholders, reviewed multiple industry and environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) disclosures, standards and frameworks and yielded 21 material topics. This process allowed us to reassess the role our business plays in society, the way we impact people and the environment and the needs of our stakeholders. Our materiality assessment is available on our website at www.investor.caesars.com within the ESG resource hub on our Corporate Social Responsibility page. \n\nResponsible Gaming \n\nFor more than thirty years, Caesars has maintained its Responsible Gaming (&#8220;RG&#8221;) program. We train tens of thousands of Team Members each year and a cadre of RG Ambassadors throughout our properties to identify guests in need of assistance and provide support. In recent years, Caesars has contributed to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, the National Council on Problem Gaming and other state programs to help advance responsible practices in the gaming industry. Caesars Digital also maintains responsible gaming programs tailored to each state in which it operates and offers users in-application RG tools such as time on device restrictions and wagering limits. \n\nCaesars maintains a comprehensive risk-based Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) and Anti-Money Laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) program. It includes strong governance and effective internal controls and procedures to comply with applicable BSA requirements, regulatory guidance, and any related laws, and to take measures to prevent its affiliated casinos from being used for money laundering or other criminal activity. Execution of the program is governed with reference to FINCEN&#8217;s guidance on the Culture of Compliance. Caesars&#8217; internal AML Policy, Know Your Customer Policy and BSA Identification Policy outline the Caesars AML Program and set the minimum standards for the related procedures and internal controls of the Caesars casino affiliates. Employees are required to complete annual trainings related company policies, including AML. \n\nCaesars also maintains a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) that includes standards designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote, amongst other standards, honest and ethical conduct and full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars&#8217; Chief Legal Officer serves as the compliance officer of the Code and Caesars provides periodic training regarding the contents and importance of the Code. \n\nCaesars also maintains an Amended and Restated Gaming Compliance Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;), which is approved by various gaming regulators. The Plan is designed to implement procedures to enhance the likelihood that no activities of the Company or any affiliate of the Company will impugn the reputation and integrity of Caesars. The Plan also establishes a Compliance Committee that assists the Company in implementing its strict policy that its business be conducted with honesty and integrity, and in accordance with high moral, legal and ethical standards. Caesars&#8217; Senior Vice President &#38; Assistant General Counsel &#8211; Regulatory &#38; Compliance serves as the Compliance Officer as defined by the Plan. \n\nEnvironmental Stewardship \n\nWe take a proactive approach to environmental sustainability through our CodeGreen strategy established in 2007, striving to improve our performance across energy and GHG emissions efficiencies, reduction of water consumption and increasing diversion of waste from landfills. Caesars recognizes the impact climate change can play both on our business and the guests we serve. Identifying, assessing, and managing the risks and opportunities therefore plays a vital role in our long-term strategic thinking on climate and water, and how we approach our CSR goals. We adopted Science Based Targets (&#8220;SBTs&#8221;) as part of our strategy to reduce our environmental impact. These targets, approved to be in line with well below 2 degrees Celsius per SBTi, are (i) reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 35% by 2025, and 100% by 2050, from a 2011 base-year and (ii) having 60% of suppliers by spend institute science-based GHG reduction targets for their operations by 2023. In 2023, we expect to establish a new baseline to reaffirm GHG emission reduction goals as a combined company, while increasing our ambition to meet a 1.5-degree reduction target. We modeled our GHG emissions data to create an estimate for 2018 and prior years back to 2011. This enabled us to compare our progress against our SBTs using actual data against a modeled 2011 base year. Between 2011 and 2021, Caesars estimated a reduction in absolute Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions of 33.9%. Caesars is pursuing renewable energy sources and low-carbon options, including on site solar developments. Our long-term goals include a continued focus on energy efficiency and conservation as well as evaluating renewable energy supply opportunities for each of our properties in pursuit of our forthcoming SBTs. \n\nWe voluntarily participate in the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an international nonprofit that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, and regions to manage their environmental impacts. In 2022, Caesars achieved A-List status for both climate change and water security and in 2021 earned a spot on the Supplier Engagement Leaderboard from CDP. Less than 3% of companies assessed by CDP in 2022 made the A List for either climate change or water security. \n\nWe are engaged in extensive waste reduction efforts across our facilities, including recycling, food donation, and manure composting. In 2021, we diverted 40% of our total waste from landfills. \n\nCommunity Investment \n\nCaesars contributes to our local communities to help them develop and prosper, through funding community projects, Team Member volunteering and cash donations from the Caesars Foundation, a private foundation funded from our operating income. In 2022, the Caesars Foundation contributed $3.3 million to communities across the United States. The Caesars Foundation also continued to support significant national relationships that support diversity, equity and inclusion. During 2022, our Team Members volunteered over 75,000 hours through the HERO program. \n\nMany of our community partners are long-term collaborations. For example, in 2022 we celebrated the 20 th anniversary of our partnership with Meal on Wheels America working together to combat the issues of senior hunger and isolation. We also implemented an expanded partnership with Boys and Girls Club of America supported by a $500,000 grant from the Caesars Foundation to support the mission of enabling young people to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. \n\nWe seek to encourage DEI dialogue in our communities as part of our advocacy approach to raise awareness. In 2022, we hosted a DEI Summit bringing together corporate and nonprofit partners and suppliers in supporting and promoting efforts to advance DEI initiatives. The Summit included several educational sessions, keynotes and panel discussions led by notable DEI leaders and practitioners, as well as a panel discussion involving diverse suppliers. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nWe are required to file annual, quarterly and other current reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). Because we submit filings to the SEC electronically, access to this information is available at the SEC&#8217;s website (www.sec.gov).

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nRisks Relating to Operating Our Business \n\nWe face substantial competition and expect that such competition will continue. \n\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate. We compete with a variety of gaming operations, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on Native American reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals at bars, restaurants and truck stops and online gambling and sports betting. We also compete, to a lesser extent, with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sportsbooks, fantasy sports websites, &#8220;cruise-to-nowhere&#8221; operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. In addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes. \n\nIn recent years, many casino and online gaming operators, including us, have reinvested in existing jurisdictions to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those jurisdictions. In particular, we and other online betting and gaming operators have undertaken extensive marketing campaigns and made significant investments in customer acquisition through pricing and promotional policies. In addition, in response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. The expansion of online betting and gaming in new jurisdictions and the growth of the number of competitors in the online betting and gaming market, the expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties, and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance. \n\nOur brick-and-mortar operations face increasing competition as a result of the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting, including our own online betting and gaming operations, in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. While we believe that we are well positioned to compete with new entrants to the betting and gaming market through our online betting and gaming offerings, the competitive dynamic is evolving and we cannot assure you that our results of operations will not be adversely impacted by the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting. \n\nStates that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming, and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future. We also compete with Native American gaming operations in California and other jurisdictions where Native American tribes operate large-scale gaming facilities or otherwise conduct gaming activities on Native American lands, which we expect will continue to expand. Further expansion of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in or near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. \n\nIncreased competition may require us to make substantial expenditures in marketing, customer development and capital projects to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our online and brick and mortar operations to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities and product offerings. Because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our lease obligations, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund, such expenditures. If we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be negatively affected. \n\nOur business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control. \n\nConsumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties and online betting and gaming is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy, the impact of high energy and food costs, rising interest rates, the increased cost of travel, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, fears of war and future acts of terrorism, or widespread illnesses or epidemics, including COVID-19, can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel, discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and could further reduce customer demand for the amenities and products that we offer. In addition, increases in gasoline prices, including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities, can adversely affect our casino operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices. \n\nWin rates (hold rates) for our casino operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and participation in the sports betting industry exposes us to trading, liability management and pricing risks. We may experience lower than expected profitability and potentially significant losses as a result of factors beyond our control or a failure to accurately determine odds. \n\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of game, on average, will win or lose in the long run. In addition to the element of chance, win rates (hold percentages) are also affected by the spread of table limits and factors that are beyond our control, such as a player&#8217;s skill, experience, and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed, and the amount of time players spend gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates at our casinos may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings of our gaming customers exceeding those anticipated. The variability of win rates (hold rates) also have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nOur fixed-odds betting products involve betting where winnings are paid on the basis of the amounts wagered and the odds quoted. Odds are determined with the objective of providing an average return to the bookmaker over a large number of events. However, there can be significant variation in gross win percentage event-by-event and day-by-day. We have systems and controls that seek to reduce the risk of daily losses occurring on a gross-win basis, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective in reducing our exposure to this risk. As a result we may experience (and we have from time to time experienced) significant losses with respect to individual events or betting outcomes, in particular if large individual bets are placed on an event or betting outcome or series of events or betting outcomes. Any significant losses on a gross-win basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn addition, the odds that we offer in our sportsbook operations may occasionally contain an obvious error. Examples of such errors are inverted lines between teams, or odds that are significantly different from the true odds of the outcome in a way that all reasonable persons would agree is an error. If regulatory restrictions do not permit us to void or re-set odds to correct odds on bets associated with large obvious errors in odds making, we could be subject to covering significant liabilities. \n\nWe rely on third parties to provide services that are essential to the operation of our online betting and gaming business, including, player account management, geolocation and identity verification, payment processing and sports data. \n\nWe rely on third parties to provide services that are essential to the operation of our online betting and gaming business, including player account management, geolocation and identity verification systems to ensure we comply with laws and regulations, processing deposits and withdrawals made by our online users and providing information regarding schedules, results, performance and outcomes of sporting events to determine when and how bets are settled. The software, systems and services provided by our third-party providers may not meet our expectations, contain errors or weaknesses, be compromised or experience outages. A failure of such third-party systems to perform effectively, or any service interruption to those systems, could adversely affect our business by preventing users from accessing our online platform, delaying payment or resulting in errors in settling bets, which could give rise to regulatory issues relating to the operation of our business. By way of example, incorrect or misleading geolocation and identity verification data with respect to current or potential users received from third-party service providers may result in us inadvertently allowing access to our offerings to individuals who are not permitted to access them or otherwise inadvertently denying access to individuals who are permitted to access them, and errors or failures by our payment processors and sports data providers could result in a failure in timely and accurately process payments to and from users or errors in settling bets. Any such errors or failures could result in violations of applicable regulatory requirements and adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain our online users. Furthermore, negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. \n\nIn addition, if any of our third-party services providers terminates its relationship with us, is unable to maintain necessary regulatory approvals, or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would have to find alternate service providers. We cannot be certain that we would be able to secure favorable terms from alternative service providers that are critical to the operation of our business or enter into alternative arrangements in a timely manner. Our digital business, results of operations and prospects would be adversely impacted by our inability or delay in securing replacement services that are sufficient to support our online business or are on comparable terms. \n\nThe growth of our digital business will depend, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. \n\nWe rely on relationships with sports leagues and teams, media companies and other third parties in order to attract users to our offerings. In 2019 we entered into an exclusive sports entertainment partnership with the NFL, making us the first ever &#8220;Official Casino Sponsor&#8221; in the history of the league and in 2020, we partnered with ESPN to integrate their digital platforms with our sportsbooks. These relationships, along with providers of online services, search engines, social media, directories and \n\nother websites and e-commerce businesses direct consumers to our offerings. While we believe there are other third parties that could drive users to our online offerings, adding or transitioning to them may disrupt our business and increase our costs, and may require us to modify, limit or discontinue certain offerings. Furthermore, sports leagues, teams and venues may enter into exclusive partnerships with our competitors which could adversely affect our ability to offer certain types of wagers. In the event that any of our existing relationships or our future relationships fail to provide services to us in accordance with the terms of our arrangement, or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, our ability to cost effectively attract consumers could be impacted and our online betting and gaming business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. \n\nThe growth of our digital business will require investments in our online offerings, technology and strategic marketing initiatives, which could be costly and negatively impact the economics of our online business. \n\nThe online betting and gaming industry is subject to rapid and frequent changes in standards, technologies, products and service offerings, as well as in customer demands and preferences and regulations, which will require us to continually introduce and successfully implement new and innovative technologies, marketing strategies, product offerings and enhancements to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand, acceptance and engagement. The process of developing new online offerings and systems is inherently complex and uncertain, and new offerings may not be well received by users, even if they are well-reviewed and of high quality. Developing new offerings and marketing strategies can also divert our management&#8217;s attention from other business issues and opportunities. New online offerings that attain market acceptance and aggressive marketing strategies implemented in the competitive online market environment could impact the mix of our existing business, including our casino business, or the share of our patron&#8217;s wallets in a manner that could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, online betting and gaming operates in a competitive environment that requires significant investment in marketing initiatives, including free play and use of a variety of free and paid marketing channels, including television, radio, social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other digital channels. We cannot be sure that our investments in technology, products, service offerings and marketing initiatives will be successful or generate the return on investment that we expect. If new or existing competitors offer more attractive offerings or engage in marketing initiatives that are better received by customers, we may lose users or users may decrease their spending on our offerings. Further, new customer demands, superior competitive offerings, new industry standards or changes in the regulatory environment could render our offerings unattractive, unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial unanticipated changes to our technology or business model. Failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or evolving customer demands, and costs required to be incurred to react to dynamic market conditions, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n\nWe face the risk of fraud, theft, and cheating. \n\nWe face the risk that gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft or cheat in order to increase winnings. Such acts of fraud, theft, or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers, or other casino or gaming area staff. Additionally, we also face the risk that customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft with respect to our non-gaming offerings or against other customers. Such risks include stolen credit or charge cards or cash, falsified checks, theft of retail inventory and purchased goods, and unpaid or counterfeit receipts. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our operations. Negative publicity related to such acts or schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nWe extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers. \n\nWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. High-stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular period. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. Gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a &#8220;marker,&#8221; and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis, and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all U.S. states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution; however, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. \n\nIn addition, the Chinese government has taken steps to prohibit the transfer of cash for the payment of gaming debts. These developments may have the effect of reducing the collectability of gaming debts of players from China. It is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect or become more restrictive in the future. These and any future foreign currency control policy developments that may be implemented by foreign jurisdictions could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and COVID-19 related impacts have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our operations and results of operations. \n\nCOVID-19 and mitigation measures recommended or required by public health officials to slow the spread of COVID-19 had a material adverse effect on our operations. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for several weeks during 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies. Following re-opening of our properties, our operations were affected by social distancing measures, including reduced gaming operations, limitations on number of customers present in our facilities, restrictions on hotel, food and beverage outlets and limits on events that would otherwise attract customers to our properties. While restrictions on our operations were eased in 2021 and we experienced positive operating trends, we continue to see prolonged impacts of COVID-19 on the economy, our industry and the Company, with increased challenges arising from labor shortages, supply chain challenges, increasing costs of goods and services, inflation and rising interest rates, among other impacts. The extent and duration of the impacts of COVID-19 on our business is difficult to predict and such impacts may intensify. \n\nActs of terrorism, war, natural disasters, severe weather, and political, economic and military conditions may impede our ability to operate or may negatively impact our financial results. \n\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties. For example, a substantial number of the customers of our properties in Las Vegas use air travel. As a result of terrorist acts that occurred on September 11, 2001, domestic and international travel was severely disrupted, which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to our properties in Las Vegas. Visitation to Las Vegas also declined for a period of time following the mass shooting tragedy on October 1, 2017. We cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, security alerts or war, uprisings, or hostilities in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and/or Syria or other countries throughout the world, and governmental responses to those acts or hostilities, will directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results. For example, a third party that is responsible for our player account management has employees in Ukraine and negative developments in Ukraine could negatively impact our digital business. As a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, natural and man-made disasters such as major fires, floods, severe snowstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes, and oil spills could also adversely impact our business and operating results. Such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities. For example, our property in Lake Charles, Louisiana was closed in August 2020 until December 2022 due to damage resulting from Hurricane Laura. Inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured. In most cases, we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, may be out of our control. In some cases, however, we may receive no proceeds from insurance. Further, if properties subject to our leases with VICI and GLPI are impacted by a casualty event, such leases require us to repair or restore the affected properties even if the cost of such repair or restoration exceeds the insurance proceeds that we receive. Under such circumstances, the rent under such leases is required to be paid during the period of repair or restoration even if all or a portion of the affected property is not operating. In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected and the timing and receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, may be out of our control. \n\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, consumers, employees, regulators, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance practices and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks, which could adversely impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee recruitment and retention. Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, consumers, employees, regulators, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance practices and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks, which could adversely impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee recruitment and retention. \n\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, consumers, employees, regulators, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance practices and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks, which could adversely impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee recruitment and retention. \n\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) practices and reporting. Investors, consumers, employees and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG practices and placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments, purchases and other interactions with companies. With this increased focus, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. If our ESG practices and reporting do not meet investor, consumer or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and customer retention may be negatively impacted. \n\nOur ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: \n\n&#9679; the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; \n\n&#9679; the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; \n\n&#9679; the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability, diversity and other ESG standards that we may set; \n\n&#9679; our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets; and \n\n&#9679; the success of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations. \n\nIf we fail, or are perceived to be failing, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure or the expectations of our various stakeholders, it could negatively impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee retention. In addition, new sustainability rules and regulations have been adopted and may continue to be introduced. Our failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations could lead to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee retention. \n\nOur business may be subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and other factors that could result in volatility and have an adverse effect on our operating results. \n\nOur business may fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors. Our casino business is impacted by weather conditions that may deter or prevent customers from reaching the facilities or undertaking trips, which would particularly affect customers who are traveling longer distances to visit our properties. Our casino business can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year, the World Series of Poker tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, a large sporting event or a concert, or visits by our premium players. Our sportsbook business may also be impacted by availability or scheduling of major sporting events or the cancellation or postponement of sporting events or races, including lockouts, strikes or similar disruptions. Seasonality, holiday, or other significant events may affect our digital operations, properties or regions differently. These factors, among other things, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, cause volatility in the trading price of our stock and impact our cash flow from quarter to quarter. \n\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy or water prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results. \n\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues. Further, our operations or the operations of our critical supplies could be negatively impacted by the duration of drought conditions, or other cause of water stress or shortages, such as those experienced in the southwest United States, or other areas in which we operate. We may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of \n\nclimate change directed at up-stream utility providers, as we could experience potentially higher utility, fuel, and transportation costs. \n\nAny deterioration in our reputation or the reputation of our brands could adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \n\nOur business is dependent on the quality and reputation of our Company and brands. Events beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties, including our digital operations, or more generally impact our corporate or brand image. Other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us, our brands or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us, our brands or our properties, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties. \n\nRisks Relating to Information Systems and Technology \n\nCompromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers&#8217; personal information could materially harm our reputation and business. \n\nWe collect and store confidential, personal information relating to our customers for various business purposes, including marketing and financial purposes, and credit card information for processing payments. For example, we handle, collect and store personal information in connection with our customers staying at our hotels and enrolling in Caesars Rewards. We may share this personal and confidential information with vendors or other third parties in connection with processing of transactions, operating certain aspects of our business, or for marketing purposes. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws and regulations as well as the applicable laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. Privacy law is subject to frequent changes and varies significantly by jurisdiction. We may incur significant costs in order to ensure compliance with the various applicable privacy requirements. In addition, privacy laws and regulations may limit our ability to market to our customers. \n\nWe assess and monitor the security of collection, storage, and transmission of customer information on an ongoing basis. We utilize commercially available software and technologies to monitor, assess and secure our network. Further, some of the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, and other such systems are determined and controlled by us. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers&#8217; confidential personal information and important internal company data, our network and other systems and those of third parties, such as service providers, could be compromised, damaged, or disrupted by a third-party breach of our system security or that of a third-party provider or as a result of purposeful or accidental actions of third parties, our employees, or those employees of a third party, power outages, computer viruses, system failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties&#8217; information security operations. Advances in computer and software capabilities, encryption technology, new tools, and other developments may increase the risk of a security breach. As a result of any security breach, customer information or other proprietary data may be accessed or transmitted by or to a third party. Despite the measures we have implemented to safeguard our information, there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information. \n\nAny loss, disclosure of, misappropriation of, or access to customers&#8217; or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information, which could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. \n\nWe have cybersecurity insurance to respond to a breach which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. We also carry other insurance which may cover ancillary aspects of the event; however, damage and claims arising from a breach may not be completely covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. \n\nOur operations, and particularly our digital betting and gaming operations, are reliant on information technology and other systems and services, and any failures, errors, defects or disruptions in our systems or services could adversely affect our operations. \n\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our digital betting and gaming operations and to user satisfaction and we rely significantly on our computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data, including data related to Caesars Rewards. We devote significant resources to our technology infrastructure, but our systems may not be adequate to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our online business. In addition, we cannot assure you that the measures we take to prevent cyber-attacks and protect our systems, data and user information and to prevent outages, data or information loss, fraud and to prevent or detect security breaches will be sufficient to ensure uninterrupted operation of our digital platform and provide absolute security. We have experienced, and we may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints. Disruptions from unauthorized access to, fraudulent manipulation of, or tampering with our computer systems and technological infrastructure, or those of third parties that provide support to our operations, could result in a wide range of negative outcomes, each of which could materially adversely affect the operation of our online business and our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n\nAdditionally, our computer systems and software may fail or may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after the launch of our online products. These types of issues could disrupt our operations or render a product unavailable when users attempt to access it or cause access to our offerings to be slower than our users expect. Inaccessibility or slow access to our products could make users less likely to return to our digital platform as often, if at all, or to recommend our offerings to other potential users, which could harm our brand perception, cause our users to stop utilizing our online offerings, divert our resources and delay market acceptance of our online offerings. \n\nWe expect that we will continue to expand our online betting and gaming offerings as our user base grows and we enter into new markets, which will require an enhancement of our technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to support the growth of our digital business and to satisfy our users&#8217; needs. Such infrastructure expansion may be complex and costly, and unanticipated delays in completing these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our offerings. In addition, there may be issues related to our online infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation and become evident after we have started to fully use the underlying equipment or software, which could impact the user experience or increase our costs. An inability to effectively scale our technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands could adversely impact our ability to grow our digital betting and gaming business. \n\nOur online business is dependent on the Internet and we rely on Amazon Web Services and other third-party technology, platforms and services to deliver our offerings to users. \n\nA substantial portion of the infrastructure that is required to enable users to access our digital betting and gaming offerings is provided by third parties, including Internet service providers and other technology-based service providers. In particular, we currently host our online betting and gaming offerings and support our operations using Amazon Web Services (&#8220;AWS&#8221;) and other third-party technology, platforms and services. Our third-party providers may experience service interruptions, delays, outages or damage, including due to capacity constraints, an event causing an unusually high volume of Internet use (such as a pandemic or public health emergency), infrastructure changes or upgrades (such as 5G or 6G services), human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. We exercise little control over our third-party providers and any difficulties that these providers experience, including the potential of certain network traffic receiving priority over other traffic (i.e., lack of net neutrality), may adversely affect our business. Because our ability to provide our users with continuing and uninterrupted access to our platform is critical to the success of our digital business, we use our best efforts to ensure that our facilities and infrastructure and the facilities and infrastructure of our third-party providers support our current and expected operations and are designed to mitigate the impacts of system malfunctions. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that such systems will be able to meet the demand of our current and future digital business, the overall online betting and gaming industry and the growth of the Internet. Furthermore, if we do not maintain business relationships with our third-party providers, and in particular, AWS, we may not be able to secure required third-party services on terms that are acceptable to us or on an acceptable time frame. Any of these risks could result in a loss of revenue and cause us to incur unexpected costs that could be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our online business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n\nOur online business model depends upon the continued compatibility between our apps and the major mobile operating systems and upon third-party platforms for the distribution of our product offerings, which depend on factors beyond our control such as the design of third-party operating systems and continued access to our apps on third-party distribution platforms like the Apple App Store. \n\nOur digital business is dependent on the interoperability of our technology with popular mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards as our users access our online betting and gaming product offerings primarily on mobile devices. As a result, our business model depends upon the continued compatibility between our app and the major mobile operating systems, such as the Android and iOS operating systems, and we rely upon third-party platforms for distribution of our product offerings. We do not have formal or informal relationships with parties that control design of mobile devices and operating systems and there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will start or continue to support or feature our product offerings. Any changes, bugs, technical or regulatory issues in such operating systems, our relationships with mobile manufacturers and carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our offerings&#8217; functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our offerings, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver high quality offerings, or impose fees or other charges related to delivering our offerings, could adversely affect our product usage and monetization on mobile devices. In addition, if any of the third-party platforms used for distribution of our product offerings were to limit or disable the availability of our app or advertising on their platforms, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed. These changes could materially impact the way we do business, and if we are unable to adjust to those changes quickly and effectively, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n\nRisks Related to Human Capital \n\nWe rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks. \n\nOur future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees. The operation of our business requires, qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need. A sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets and the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities, including the expansion of Native American gaming and internet betting and gaming, may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified candidates. While we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees, shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees, and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result. \n\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 21,000 employees. A lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nFrom time to time, we have also experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our non-union employees. These efforts have achieved some success to date. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future. The impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our results of operations. \n\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers and other entertainment offerings on acceptable terms or at all. \n\nHistorically, our performers have drawn customers to our properties and have been a significant source of our revenue. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers or other shows on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the third parties that we depend on for our properties&#8217; entertainment offerings may become incapable or unwilling to provide their services at the level agreed upon or at all. Disruptions in the performance schedule can leave us without entertainment offerings, which could negatively impact our business. \n\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure \n\nOur substantial indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of our cash flow is used to make interest payments and rent payments under our debt and lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments and rent payments. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 we had $13.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness, in addition to leases with VICI and GLPI that require an annual rent payment of $1.3 billion in 2023 and are subject to annual escalation, including annual escalations based on the CPI. See Note 10 for a description of our obligations under our leases with VICI and GLPI and Note 12 for details regarding our debt outstanding and related restrictive covenants. As a result, a significant portion of our cash flow is applied to make interest payments with respect to our outstanding debt and payments under our leases. These financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us, including: \n\n&#8226; limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make payments on our debt and lease obligations; \n\n&#8226; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate; \n\n&#8226; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with debt and rent obligations that are less than ours; \n\n&#8226; increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, COVID-19 and other public health emergencies, changes in our industry and economic downturns; \n\n&#8226; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations; \n\n&#8226; subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to make capital expenditures and limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make other investments; \n\n&#8226; exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facilities; and \n\n&#8226; affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business. \n\nOur ability to service our current and future levels of indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, including the interest rate environment and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. \n\nThere is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs and we may be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, reducing or discontinuing dividends we may pay in the future, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we expect to refinance or replace our debt facilities when they mature, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms. \n\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness. Incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness. \n\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, and may enter into financing obligations similar to our leases with VICI and GLPI in the future. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.2 billion of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, before consideration of $82 million in outstanding letters of credit and $48 million committed for regulatory purposes under our CEI Revolving Credit Facility. Further, our existing debt agreements currently permit, and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit, us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt. Further, we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. The risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future. \n\nOur variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate volatility, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. \n\nBorrowings under certain of our facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate volatility. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same. In addition, at the end of 2021, the administrator for London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) ceased publishing one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and will cease publishing all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR \n\ntenors in mid-2023. Concurrently, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority announced the cessation or loss of representativeness of the U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors from those dates. While we continue to monitor market developments to assess replacement rate options, the consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and may result in the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates to be affected, which may adversely impact the amount of our interest payments under such debt. \n\nA significant portion of our casinos are located on leased property. If we default on one or more leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino. \n\nWe currently lease certain parcels of land on which a significant portion of our properties are located. As a ground lessee, we have the right to use the leased land; however, we do not hold fee ownership of the underlying land. Accordingly, we have no interest in the leased land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases. If our use of the land underlying our casino properties is disrupted permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. Our leases provide that they may be terminated for a number of reasons, including failure to pay rent, taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of other covenants contained in the leases. In particular, our leases with VICI and GLPI require annual rent payments of $1.3 billion in 2023, which is subject to escalation annually, and obligate us to make specified minimum capital expenditures with respect to the leased properties. If our business and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings, the payments required to service the rent obligations under our leases with VICI and GLPI could materially and adversely limit our ability to react to changes in our business and make acquisitions and investments in our properties. If we were to default on any one or more of these leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land, including the hotels and casinos. A termination of our ground leases or our leases with GLPI or VICI could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, in the event that any lessor of our leased properties, including GLPI or VICI, encounters financial, operational, regulatory or other challenges, there can be no assurance that such lessor will be able to comply with its obligations under the applicable lease. \n\nCertain of our leases, including our leases with VICI and GLPI, are &#8220;triple-net&#8221; leases. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay, among other things, the following: (1) lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases; (2) facility maintenance costs; (3) all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (4) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the lessor as the owner of the associated facilities. In addition, we remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under our leases with VICI and GLPI and other ground leases even if one or more of such leased facilities is unprofitable or if we decide to withdraw from those locations. We could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks \n\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, taxation policies and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nLicensing Requirements . The ownership and operation of casino gaming, online betting and gaming, riverboat and horse racing facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at local, state and national levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses. We currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations, but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we are required to provide information relating to our operations to various gaming regulatory agencies. A failure to provide accurate information could result in the imposition of fines or other penalties by the relevant regulatory authority. Furthermore, if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended or interpreted differently, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. \n\nGaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may, in their discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities, and, if a holder is found unsuitable, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions, if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities. Our officers, directors and key employees are also \n\nsubject to similar findings of unsuitability and the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. See &#8220;Item 1 - Gaming Licenses and Governmental Regulations&#8221; and Exhibit 99.1 for further description of the regulations to which we are subject. We may be required under applicable gaming laws and regulations to obtain approval of applicable gaming authorities to issue securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. \n\nCompliance with Other Laws . We are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses, including restrictions enacted in response to COVD-19, zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages. Our operations have been adversely impacted by regulations enacted to limit the spread of COVID-19. In addition, legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. If additional restrictions are enacted in our jurisdictions, we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and operating results at our properties and, particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market, our business could be materially adversely affected. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any additional limitations on our operations would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance. \n\nRegulations adopted by FINCEN require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day. U.S. Treasury Department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000, if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations. FINCEN has recently increased its focus on gaming companies. \n\nWe are required to report certain customer&#8217;s gambling winnings via form W-2G to comply with current Internal Revenue Service regulations. Should these regulations change, we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements. \n\nTaxation and Fees . In addition, gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied, affecting the gaming industry. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results. \n\nThe growth of our online betting and gaming business will depend on expansion of online betting and gaming into new jurisdictions and our ability to obtain required licenses. \n\nOur ability to achieve growth in our online betting and gaming business will depend, in large part, upon expansion of online betting and gaming into new jurisdictions, the terms of regulations relating to online betting and gaming and our ability to obtain required licenses. Following the 2018 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the federal ban on sports betting, a number of jurisdictions have legalized sports betting and online gaming and we expect that additional jurisdictions may do so in the future. Our ability to further expand our sports betting and online operations is dependent on the adoption of regulations permitting such activities. However, the expansion of betting and online gaming in new jurisdictions is dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control and there can be no assurances of when, or if, such regulations will be adopted or the terms of such regulations, including restrictions, tax rates and license fees and availability of such licenses to casino owners exclusively or at all. \n\nWe may not be able to protect the intellectual property rights we own or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our business. \n\nThe development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. We rely primarily on trade secret, trademark, domain name, copyright, and contract law to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology we own. We also actively pursue business opportunities in the United States and in international jurisdictions involving the licensing of our trademarks to third parties. It is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. For example, while we have a policy of entering into confidentiality, intellectual property invention assignment, and/or non-competition and non-solicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees, independent contractors, and business partners, such agreements may not provide adequate protection or may be breached, or our proprietary \n\ntechnology may otherwise become available to or be independently developed by our competitors. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our trademarks and our market acceptance, competitive advantages, or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nOur technology contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under &#8220;open source&#8221; licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our technology and, under certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. \n\nThird parties have alleged and may in the future allege that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Third parties may initiate litigation against us without warning or may send us letters or other communications that make allegations without initiating litigation. We may elect not to respond to these letters or other communications if we believe they are without merit, or we may attempt to resolve these disputes out of court by negotiating a license, but in either case it is possible that such disputes will ultimately result in litigation. Any such claims could interfere with our ability to use technology or intellectual property that is material to the operation of our business. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties, such as entities that purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of bringing infringement claims. We also periodically employ individuals who were previously employed by our competitors or potential competitors, and we may therefore be subject to claims that such employees have used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. \n\nWe may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, including with respect to technology that we believe to be &#8220;open source&#8221;. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management. If unsuccessful, such litigation could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights, require us to pay substantial damages, subject us to injunctions that prevent us from using certain intellectual property, require us to make admissions that affect our reputation in the marketplace, or require us to enter into license agreements that may not be available on favorable terms, re-engineer our technology or discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings. Finally, even if we prevail in any litigation, the remedy may not be commercially meaningful or fully compensate us for the harm we suffer or the costs we incur. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe rely on licenses to use the intellectual property rights of third parties which are incorporated into our products and services. Failure to renew or expand existing licenses may require us to modify, limit or discontinue certain offerings. \n\nWe rely on products, technologies and intellectual property that we license from third parties, for use in our business-to-business and business-to-consumers offerings. Certain of our offerings and services use intellectual property licensed from third parties and we expect that our future products will require the use of third-party intellectual property. The future success of our business may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, retain and/or expand licenses for popular technologies and games in a competitive market. We cannot assure that third-party licenses that may be necessary or desirable for the operation of our products, or support for such licensed products and technologies, will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to renew and/or expand existing licenses or obtain new licenses, including as a result of reluctance of third parties to subject themselves to regulatory review that may be required to operate as our supplier, we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the products that include or incorporate the licensed intellectual property, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and prospects. \n\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition. \n\nFrom time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses. Some of these matters involve commercial or contractual disputes, intellectual property claims, legal compliance, personal injury claims, and employment claims. As with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n"

Market for Registrants&#8217; Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities \n\nOur Common Stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol &#8220;CZR&#8221;. As of February 16, 2023, there were approximately 310 holders of record of our common stock. \n\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain all of our earnings to finance the development of our business, and thus, do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, operations and capital requirements, our general financial condition, general business conditions and restrictions that may be in place under our borrowing arrangements or existing lease agreements. \n\nEquity Compensation Plan Information \n\nWe maintain long-term incentive plans which allow for granting stock-based compensation awards for directors, employees, officers, and consultants or advisers who render services to the Company or its subsidiaries, based on Company Common Stock, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;), performance stock units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;), market-based performance stock units (&#8220;MSUs&#8221;), stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalents.

As of December 31, 2022, no shares of preferred stock have been issued. \n\nShare Repurchase Program \n\nIn November 2018, our Board authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $150 million of stock (the &#8220;Share Repurchase Program&#8221;) pursuant to which we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of common stock on the open market (either with or without a 10b5-1 plan) or through privately negotiated transactions. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that we are required to repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have acquired 223,823 shares of common stock under this program since 2018 at an aggregate value of $9 million and an average of $40.80 per share. No shares were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities \n\nNone. \n\nStock Performance Graph \n\nThe graph depicted below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return on the Standard &#38; Poor's 500 Stock Index (&#8220;S&#38;P 500&#8221;) and the Dow Jones U.S. Gambling Total Stock Market Index (&#8220;Dow Jones U.S. Gambling&#8221;) for the period beginning on December 31, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2022.

Our objectives are: (i) to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that will enable investors to see the Company through the eyes of management; (ii) to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed; and (iii) to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our earnings and cash flows so that investors can ascertain the likelihood of whether past performance is indicative of future performance. \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (&#8220;Isle&#8221; or &#8220;Isle of Capri&#8221;) in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018 and a merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (&#8220;Former Caesars&#8221;) on July 20, 2020, pursuant to which Former Caesars became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) and our ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market changed from &#8220;ERI&#8221; to &#8220;CZR.&#8221; In addition, on April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC (the &#8220;William Hill Acquisition&#8221;). \n\nWe currently own, lease or manage an aggregate of 51 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 52,800 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,800 table games and approximately 47,200 hotel rooms as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. Our primary source of revenue is generated by our casino properties&#8217; gaming operations, including our retail and online sports betting, as well as our online gaming, and we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we owned 20 of our casinos and leased 25 casinos in the U.S. We lease 18 casinos from VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (&#8220;VICI&#8221;) pursuant to a regional lease, a Las Vegas lease and a Joliet lease (collectively, &#8220;VICI Leases&#8221;). We also lease six casinos from GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (&#8220;GLPI&#8221;), pursuant to a Master Lease (as amended, the &#8220;GLPI Master Lease&#8221;) and a Lumi&#232;re lease (together with the GLPI Master Lease, the &#8220;GLPI Leases&#8221;). Additionally, we lease the Rio All-Suite Hotel &#38; Casino from a separate third party. See descriptions under the &#8220;GLPI Leases&#8221; and &#8220;VICI Leases.&#8221; \n\nWe also operate and conduct sports wagering across 28 jurisdictions in North America, 20 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operate regulated online real money gaming in six jurisdictions in North America. Our Caesars Sportsbook app operates on the Liberty platform, which we acquired in the William Hill Acquisition along with other technology platforms that we intend to migrate to the Liberty platform in the future, subject to required approvals. The map below illustrates Caesars Digital&#8217;s presence as of December 31, 2022: \n\nOn January 1, 2023, we launched mobile sports betting on our Liberty platform in Ohio and Caesars Sportsbook is now accepting in-person sports wagers and mobile account cash deposits at certain destinations including Eldorado Gaming Scioto Downs. \n\nIn addition to the Caesars Sportsbook app, we partnered with NYRABets LLC, the official online wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, Inc., and launched the Caesars Racebook app within eight states as of December 31, 2022. The Caesars Racebook app provides access for pari-mutuel wagering at over 300 race tracks around the world as well as livestreaming of races. Wagers placed can earn credits towards our Caesars Rewards loyalty program or points which can be redeemed for free wagering credits. \n\nWe are also in the process of continuing the expansion of our Caesars Digital footprint in the near term with our Caesars Sportsbook and Caesars Racebook apps as jurisdictions legalize or provide necessary approvals. \n\nWe periodically divest of assets in order to raise capital or as a result of a determination that the assets are not core to our business. We also divested certain assets in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals related to closing of the Merger.

On the acquisition date, our intent was to divest William Hill PLC&#8217;s non-U.S. operations, including the United Kingdom and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, &#8220;William Hill International&#8221;), which were held for sale as of the date of the closing of the William Hill Acquisition with such operations reflected within discontinued operations. On April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for &#163;2.9 billion , or approximately $3.9 billion . \n\nOn September 8, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately &#163;2.2 billion. On April 7, 2022, we amended the agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for a revised enterprise value of approximately &#163;2.0 billion. The amended agreement reflected a &#163;250 million reduction in consideration payable at closing and up to &#163;100 million as deferred consideration to be paid to us, subject to 888 Holdings Plc meeting certain 2023 financial targets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairments to assets held for sale of $503 million within discontinued operations based on the revised and final sales prices. \n\nOn July 1, 2022, we completed the sale of William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc and outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement between the Company and certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as administrative agent and collateral agent were immediately repaid. After the repayment of the Bridge Credit Agreement, other permitted leakage, and the settlement of related forward contracts, we received net proceeds of $730 million. Including open market repurchases and repayments, we utilized all $730 million to reduce our outstanding debt. \n\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $21 million, $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction cost associated with sale of William Hill International. These costs were associated with legal, professional services and certain severance and retention costs and were primarily recorded in Transaction and other costs in our Statements of Operations. \n\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore \n\nOn August 26, 2021, we increased our ownership interest in CBAC Borrower, LLC (&#8220;Horseshoe Baltimore&#8221;), a property which we also manage, to approximately 75.8% for cash consideration of $55 million. As a result of the increase in our ownership interest, our previously held investment was remeasured and we recognized a gain of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Subsequent to the change in ownership, we determined that we have a controlling financial interest and began to consolidate the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore. \n\nMerger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation \n\nOn July 20, 2020, the Merger was consummated and Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The strategic rationale for the Merger includes, but is not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; Creation of the largest owner, operator and manager of domestic gaming assets \n\n&#8226; Diversification of the Company&#8217;s domestic footprint \n\n&#8226; Access to iconic brands, rewards programs and new gaming opportunities expected to enhance customer experience \n\n&#8226; Realization of significant identified synergies \n\nThe total purchase consideration for Former Caesars was $10.9 billion. The estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value. \n\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nInvestments and Partnerships \n\nNeoGames \n\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included an investment in NeoGames S.A. (&#8220;NeoGames&#8221;), a global leader of iLottery solutions and services to national and state-regulated lotteries, and other investments. On September 16, 2021, we sold a portion of our shares of NeoGames common stock for $136 million which decreased our ownership interest from 24.5% to approximately 8.4%. Additionally, on March 14, 2022 we sold our remaining 2 million shares at fair value for $26 million. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded losses related to the investment in NeoGames of $34 million and $54 million, respectively, which is included within Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations. \n\nPompano Joint Venture \n\nIn April 2018, we entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies (&#8220;Cordish&#8221;) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at our Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish is responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with our input and will submit it for our review and approval. In June 2021, the joint venture issued a capital call and we contributed $3 million, for a total of $4 million in cash contributions since inception of the joint venture. On February 12, 2021, we contributed 186 acres to the joint venture with a fair value of $61 million. Total contributions of approximately 206 acres of land have been made with a fair value of approximately $69 million, and we have no further obligation to contribute additional real estate or cash. \n\nWhile we hold a 50% variable interest in the joint venture, we are not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. We participate evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction and other costs on our Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company&#8217;s investment in the joint venture is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on our Balance Sheets. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nSegment results in this MD&#38;A are presented consistent with the way our management reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a &#8220;significant market&#8221; basis. Management views each of the Company&#8217;s casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. Our principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. See Item 2. &#8220;Properties&#8221; for listing of properties by segment. \n\nPresentation of Financial Information \n\nThe financial information included in this Item 7 for the periods after our acquisitions of Former Caesars on July 20, 2020, William Hill on April 22, 2021 and of the increase in our ownership percentage and subsequent consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021, is not fully comparable to the periods prior to the acquisitions. In addition, the presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company&#8217;s sales of various properties, described above, is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective sale dates. \n\nThis MD&#38;A is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the factors described in the preceding paragraph and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, including changes in market and societal trends, increased competition, as well as by factors or trends discussed elsewhere herein. We recommend that you read this MD&#38;A in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nKey Performance Metrics \n\nOur primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, including retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming. Additionally we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers visiting and staying at our properties and using our sports betting and iGaming applications. \n\nKey performance metrics include volume indicators such as drop or handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. The amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. Slot win percentage is typically in the range of approximately 9% to 11% of slot handle for both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Table game hold percentage is typically in the range of approximately 16% to 23% of table game drop in both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Sports betting hold is typically in the range of 5% to 9% and iGaming hold typically ranges from 3% to 4%. In addition, hotel occupancy, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, is a key indicator for our hotel business in the Las Vegas segment. See &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; section below. Complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. The key metrics we utilize to measure our profitability and performance are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. \n\nSignificant Factors Impacting Financial Results \n\nThe following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nAcquisitions and Transaction Costs \n\n&#8226; William Hill Acquisition &#8211; On April 22, 2021, we consummated the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction of &#163;2.9 billion , or approximately $3.9 billion. We recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $21 million, $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction costs associated with sale of William Hill International. \n\n&#8226; Consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore &#8211; On August 26, 2021, we increased our ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore to approximately 75.8%. Prior to the purchase, we held an interest in Horseshoe Baltimore of approximately 44.3% which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Subsequent to the change in ownership, we determined we have a controlling financial interest and have consolidate the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore. As a result of the consolidation, we recognized a gain of $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\n&#8226; Merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation &#8211; The Merger closed on July 20, 2020 and we have recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nDivestitures and Discontinued Operations \n\n&#8226; Divestitures and Discontinued Operations &#8211; See &#8220;Overview&#8221; section above for detail of properties divested, including related discontinued operations. \n\nFinancing Transactions \n\n&#8226; Debt Transactions - We continue to utilize free cash flow to reduce our leverage and extend the maturity of our outstanding debt. The following are the key financing transactions and their effects on our operations, from the use of free cash flow, unless otherwise noted: \n\n&#9702; Utilized proceeds from the sale of William Hill International and cash on hand to make partial prepayments of $755 million of the outstanding principal of the CRC Incremental Term Loan. \n\n&#9702; Repaid $300 million of the outstanding principal of the CRC Term Loan, excluding the prepayment resulting from the proceeds of the CEI Term Loan A described below. \n\n&#9702; Purchased a total of $11 million in principal amount of the CRC Senior Secured Notes and $89 million in principal amount of CEI Senior Notes due 2027. \n\n&#9702; Amended the CEI Credit Agreement and utilized the entire proceeds of a new $750 million CEI Term Loan A to make a partial prepayment of the outstanding principal of the CRC Term Loan, terminate the CRC Revolving Credit Facility and increase the aggregate principal amount of the CEI Revolving Credit Facility to $2.25 billion. \n\n&#9702; For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded loss on extinguishment of debt of $85 million, $236 million and $197 million respectively, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt on the Statement of Operations due to the aforementioned activity. \n\n&#9702; Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for a further discussion of our recent debt transactions, including our financing transactions in 2023 in which we issued new CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030, a new CEI Term Loan B, and fully repaid the CRC Term Loan and CRC Incremental Term Loan. \n\nOther Significant Factors \n\n&#8226; Economic Factors Impacting Discretionary Spending &#8211; Gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures which may be sensitive to economic downturns. The resurgence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 impacted the beginning of the year, however, many of our properties experienced positive trends during much of the year ended December 31, 2022, including higher hotel occupancy and rates, particularly in Las Vegas, and increased gaming and food and beverage volumes coupled with improved product mix. The reduction in mandates and restrictions, combined with pent up consumer demand and supplemental discretionary spend from governmental stimulus, resulted in strong results across our properties during 2021. In addition to the loss of government stimulus programs from prior year that increased consumer discretionary spend, we are monitoring the trend of higher inflation in the current year and the possible implications to our customers. Although we have seen some periods of reduced visitation from those customers that are most affected by inflation, visitation from those customers not as sensitive to inflation remains steady or has slightly improved. \n\n&#8226; Impairment Charges &#8211; As a result of our finalized and approved capital and operating plans and the completion of our 2022 annual impairment testing, we recognized impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2022 in our Regional segment primarily due to an increase in the related discount rates, which represents the higher required cost of capital as a result of the macroeconomic environment and projected outlook. We identified one property, where the estimated fair value of the associated gaming rights was less than the carrying value and we recorded an impairment of $30 million. In addition, we identified two properties, where the estimated fair value of the enterprise was less than the carrying value and recorded an impairment to goodwill of $78 million. In December 2021, we approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties. We utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $102 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $100 million and $16 million, respectively, due to the effects of COVID-19. In addition, as a result of entering agreements to sell properties in our Regional segment, impairment charges totaling $99 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the net sales proceeds. \n\n&#8226; Weather Disruption &#8211; In late August 2020, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by Hurricane Laura, causing severe damage to Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles. As a result of the damage, the property remained closed during the construction of a new land-based location, Horseshoe Lake Charles, which opened in December 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we reached a final settlement agreement with the insurance carriers for the damage and disruption for a total amount of $128 million, before our insurance deductible of $25 million. We have received a total of $103 million related to damaged fixed assets, remediation costs and business interruption. \n\nWe recorded gains of $38 million and $21 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, which are included in Transaction and other costs in our Statements of Operations, as proceeds received for the cost to replace damaged property were in excess of respective carrying value of the assets. \n\n&#8226; Caesars Sportsbook and Caesars Racebook &#8211; In connection with the launch and rebranding of the Caesars Sportsbook app, our Caesars Digital segment launched a significant marketing campaign in the second half of 2021 with distinguished actors, former athletes and other media personalities. As new states and jurisdictions have legalized sports betting, we have made significant upfront investments which have been executed through marketing campaigns and promotional incentives to acquire new customers and establish ourselves as an industry leader. For example, in connection with the launch of our Caesars Sportsbook app in the state of New York on January 8, 2022 and Louisiana on January 28, 2022, we experienced negative net revenue at the beginning of 2022 resulting from a substantial amount of bonus cash and matched deposits issued to customers as sign-on incentives, which exceeded our gaming win. Our level of investment and types of incentives provided are discretionary and are not expected to continue at elevated levels subsequent to the initial launch period. In addition, as our Caesars Racebook launches in new states and jurisdictions, we may offer deposit matching incentives to new users. A significant portion of our marketing and promotional costs are variable and we continue to monitor and adjust our level of investment based on jurisdiction specific conditions, customer behaviors, and results observed from prior state launches. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nThe following table highlights the results of our operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net revenues: Las Vegas $ 4,287 $ 3,409 $ 751 Regional 5,704 5,537 2,660 Caesars Digital 548 337 95 Managed and Branded 282 278 107 Corporate and Other (a) \n\n&#8212; 9 15 Total $ 10,821 $ 9,570 $ 3,628 Net loss $ (910) $ (1,016) $ (1,758) \n\nAdjusted EBITDA (b) : \n\nLas Vegas $ 1,964 $ 1,568 $ 133 Regional 1,985 1,979 711 Caesars Digital (666) (476) 26 Managed and Branded 84 87 25 Corporate and Other (a) \n\n(124) (168) (101) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,243 $ 2,990 $ 794 Net loss margin (8.4) % (10.6) % (48.5) % Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.0 % 31.2 % 21.9 % ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(a) Corporate and Other includes revenues related to certain licensing arrangements and various revenue sharing agreements.

A discussion of changes in our results of operations between year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in &#8220; Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 &#8221; of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nNet Revenues \n\nNet revenues were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Variance Percent Change Variance Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 \n\n2021 vs 2020 \n\nCasino $ 5,997 $ 5,827 $ 2,482 $ 170 2.9 % $ 3,345 134.8 % Food and beverage 1,596 1,140 342 456 40.0 % 798 * Hotel 1,957 1,551 450 406 26.2 % 1,101 * Other 1,271 1,052 354 219 20.8 % 698 197.2 % Net Revenues $ 10,821 $ 9,570 $ 3,628 $ 1,251 13.1 % $ 5,942 163.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n* Not meaningful. \n\nDespite the resurgence of the Omicron variant during the beginning of 2022, consolidated net revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company&#8217;s net revenues have benefited from steady gaming volumes at our properties, increased hotel occupancy and room rates, and improved food and beverage offerings. Banquets and conventions have improved during the current year, in addition to a strengthening of international visitation. The Company continues to remain strategic with new food and beverage offerings with a focus on operating margins and product mix. Restaurant covers have increased during the year, driven by our Las Vegas segment. Live entertainment events have also increased year over year following the prolonged impacts from COVID-19. Additionally, the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021 contributed to the increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases were offset slightly by negative gaming revenue in our Caesars Digital segment in the first quarter of 2022 and construction disruption experienced at certain properties. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Variance Percent Change Variance Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 \n\n2021 vs 2020 \n\nCasino $ 3,526 $ 3,129 $ 1,271 $ 397 12.7 % $ 1,858 146.2 % Food and beverage 935 707 265 228 32.2 % 442 166.8 % Hotel 529 438 170 91 20.8 % 268 157.6 % Other 411 373 140 38 10.2 % 233 166.4 % General and administrative 2,068 1,782 902 286 16.0 % 880 97.6 % Corporate 286 309 195 (23) (7.4) % 114 58.5 % Impairment charges 108 102 215 6 5.9 % (113) (52.6) % Depreciation and amortization 1,205 1,126 583 79 7.0 % 543 93.1 % Transaction and other costs 14 144 270 (130) (90.3) % (126) (46.7) % Total operating expenses $ 9,082 $ 8,110 $ 4,011 $ 972 12.0 % $ 4,099 102.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nCasino expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages associated with our gaming operations, gaming taxes and marketing and promotions attributable to our Caesars Digital segment. Food and beverage expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our food and beverage operations. Hotel expenses consist principally of salaries and wages, supplies and costs of services associated with our hotel operations. Other expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our retail, entertainment and other operations. \n\nCasino, food and beverage, hotel, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased year over year following the revenue increases noted above, in addition to the impacts of the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. Advertising costs consisting of television, radio and internet marketing campaigns directly attributable to our Caesars Sportsbook app also contributed to the increase, particularly during the launch of the app in New York and Louisiana during the first quarter. These increases were partially offset as we scaled back our advertising efforts subsequent to the first quarter of 2022 and continue to identify more efficient methods to manage marketing and promotional spend and reduce gaming expenses within our Las Vegas and Regional segments. Further, we have managed increases in food costs by focusing on efficiencies within food and beverage venues and menu options. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses include items such as information technology, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability insurance, expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, compliance, purchasing, human resources, legal, internal audit, and property taxes. General and administrative expenses also include other marketing expenses indirectly related to our gaming and non-gaming operations. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same prior year period, mainly due to the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. Property information technology costs, other marketing expenses and utility expenses also increased compared to the prior year. \n\nCorporate expenses include unallocated expenses such as payroll, inclusive of the annual bonus, stock-based compensation, professional fees, and other various expenses not directly related to the Company&#8217;s operations. \n\nTransaction and other costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased year over year due to a gain of approximately $38 million as proceeds received for the Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles property damage were in excess of the respective carrying value of the assets. Additionally, no significant acquisition related transaction costs were incurred during the year as compared to the William Hill Acquisition in the prior year. \n\nOther Expense \n\nOther expense was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Variance Percent Change Variance Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 \n\n2021 vs 2020 \n\nInterest expense, net $ (2,265) $ (2,295) $ (1,202) $ 30 1.3 % $ (1,093) (90.9) % Loss on extinguishment of debt (85) (236) (197) 151 64.0 % (39) (19.8) % Other income (loss) 46 (198) 176 244 * (374) * Benefit (provision) for income taxes 41 283 (132) (242) (85.5) % 415 * ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n* Not meaningful. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, interest expense, remained consistent year over year as a result of decreased interest expense associated with our debt instruments, offset by increases in interest expense associated with the financing obligations related to our leases with VICI and GLPI which contain annual escalators which have resulted in increased interest expense year over year. Repayments and early extinguishments during the prior year, which continued into the current year, and favorable interest rates from new debt have resulted in lower interest expense associated with our debt. \n\nLoss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to the extinguishment of deferred financing costs and discounts associated with early partial repayments of the CRC Term Loan and the CRC Incremental Term Loan. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to early repayment premiums, and extinguishment of deferred financing costs and discounts associated with the prepayments of the CRC Notes and CEI Senior Notes, the repricing of the CRC Incremental Term Loan, and the early extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, other income (loss) primarily consisted of a gain related to the resolution of a portion of disputed claims liability related to Former Caesars&#8217; bankruptcy and a change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, offset by the change in fair value of investments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, other income (loss) primarily consisted of a loss on the change in fair value of investments and a loss on the change in fair value of the derivative liability related to the 5% Convertible Notes. \n\nThe effective tax rate was 7.2% for 2022, 22.3% for 2021, and (8.2)% for 2020. The effective tax rate in 2022 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in tax expense due to state rate changes and a deferred tax adjustment related to the tax impact of the settlement of preexisting relationships upon the William Hill Acquisition in 2021 that was partially offset by changes to the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate in 2020 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets due to the series of transactions with VICI during the year. Such transactions did not occur in 2021.

Visitation to Las Vegas has continued to trend toward levels experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Table game drop and slot handle have increased with slight increases in hold. Increased casino revenues were slightly offset by gaming capacity disruption at Caesars Palace caused by the renovation to the front entrance during the third quarter of 2022. Restaurant covers have increased during the year and we continue to expand food and beverage offerings, including Bobby&#8217;s Burgers, Nobu, and The Bedford by Martha Stewart at Paris, among others, with additional venues scheduled to open in 2023. Banquets and conventions have contributed to the positive results during the year helping continued growth in hotel occupancy and room rates. \n\nSlot win percentage in Las Vegas during the year ended December 31, 2022 was within our typical range. \n\nRegional Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Variance Percent Change Variance Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 \n\n2021 vs 2020 \n\nRevenues: Casino $ 4,291 $ 4,305 $ 2,079 $ (14) (0.3) % $ 2,226 107.1 % Food and beverage 533 438 211 95 21.7 % 227 107.6 % Hotel 616 583 264 33 5.7 % 319 120.8 % Other 264 211 106 53 25.1 % 105 99.1 % Net revenues $ 5,704 $ 5,537 $ 2,660 $ 167 3.0 % $ 2,877 108.2 % Table game drop $ 4,270 $ 4,163 $ 2,386 $ 107 2.6 % $ 1,777 74.5 % Table game hold % 22.0 % 21.0 % 20.6 % 1 pts 0.4 pts Slot handle $ 42,853 $ 42,873 $ 24,441 $ (20) &#8212; % $ 18,432 75.4 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,985 $ 1,979 $ 711 $ 6 0.3 % $ 1,268 178.3 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 34.8 % 35.7 % 26.7 % (0.9) pts 9 pts Net income (loss) attributable to Caesars $ 463 $ 637 $ (349) $ (174) (27.3) % $ 986 * ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n* Not meaningful. \n\nRegional segment&#8217;s net income (loss) decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to impairments of $108 million recognized during the period, and a non-recurring prior year gain of $40 million related to our investment in Horseshoe Baltimore. Net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same prior year period, in part from the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. Table game volume for the year ended December 31, 2022 remained comparable, however slot volume decreased slightly from strong results during 2021 due to the reduction in supplemental discretionary spend from governmental stimulus. Performance among our Regional properties was affected by a resurgence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in the beginning of 2022; however, the Regional segment trended positively due to improved food and beverage offerings, increased hotel revenues and an increase in banquets. We continue to monitor trends observed during the current year of periods of reduced visitation from certain customers most affected by current inflationary pressures whereas visitation from customers not as affected by such pressures remains steady or has slightly improved. Further, renovations and capital projects at Harrah&#8217;s New Orleans and Atlantic City properties have led to slight disruptions in operations. Despite these headwinds, and the impact of our recent divestitures described above, our results of operations remain strong as compared to pre-pandemic years. \n\nSlot win percentage in the Regional segment during the year ended December 31, 2022 was within our typical range. \n\nCaesars Digital Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Variance Percent Change Variance Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 \n\n2021 vs 2020 \n\nRevenues: Casino (a) \n\n$ 462 $ 296 $ 84 $ 166 56.1 % $ 212 * Other 86 41 11 45 109.8 % 30 * Net revenues $ 548 $ 337 $ 95 $ 211 62.6 % $ 242 * \n\nSports betting handle (b) \n\n$ 12,801 $ 6,046 $ 30 $ 6,755 111.7 % $ 6,016 * Sports betting hold % 5.4 % 4.3 % 3.3 % 1.1 pts 1 pts iGaming handle $ 8,073 $ 5,621 $ 2,448 $ 2,452 43.6 % $ 3,173 129.6 % iGaming hold % 3.2 % 3.3 % 3.5 % (0.1) pts (0.2) pts Adjusted EBITDA $ (666) $ (476) $ 26 $ (190) (39.9) % $ (502) * Adjusted EBITDA margin (121.5) % (141.2) % 27.4 % 19.7 pts * Net income (loss) attributable to Caesars $ (790) $ (580) $ 26 $ (210) (36.2) % $ (606) * ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n* Not meaningful. \n\n(a) Includes total promotional and complimentary incentives related to sports betting, iGaming, and poker of $542 million, $187 million and $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Hold related to these operations was 11.0% and 9.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sports betting handle includes $50 million and $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to horse racing and pari-mutuel wagers. \n\nCaesars Digital includes the operations for our retail and mobile sports betting, online casino, poker and horse racing, which includes our Caesars Sportsbook and Caesars Racebook apps. Caesars Digital&#8217;s sports betting handle, iGaming handle, and net revenues increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same prior year period due to the William Hill Acquisition, the launch of our Caesars Sportsbook app in 2021, and the expansion of sports betting into additional states and jurisdictions subsequent to the acquisition. Net Revenues increased overall during the year ended December 31, 2022 due to higher handle and improved sports betting hold. Net revenues during the first quarter of 2022 were negatively impacted by costs associated with significant promotions offered with the launch of our Caesars Sportsbook, particularly in New York and Louisiana, which included cash bonuses and matched deposits to new customers as sign-on incentives. Following the first quarter, Caesars digital&#8217;s operations continued to improve for the remainder of 2022, nearly reaching positive net income and adjusted EBITDA during the fourth quarter. \n\nSports betting and iGaming hold percentages for the year ended December 31, 2022 were within our typical range. \n\nWe expect to continue to expand into new jurisdictions with our apps, our Caesars branded retail sportsbooks, and our iGaming applications, to the extent such jurisdictions allow. Historically we have deployed a significant level of marketing spend to build brand awareness and acquire and retain customers when entering new jurisdictions. As a result of our established market presence, we expect to remain strategic with our level of investment in new and existing markets. \n\nAs sports betting and online casinos expand through increased state legalization and customer adoption, growth in marketing and promotional costs in highly competitive markets negatively impacts Caesars Digital Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins in comparison to prior periods. These periods are not expected to be long in duration as we use our discretion to determine the ongoing level of investment for a particular jurisdiction. \n\nManaged and Branded Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Variance Percent Change Variance Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 \n\n2021 vs 2020 \n\nRevenues: Food and beverage $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 1 $ &#8212; * $ (1) (100.0) % Other 282 278 106 4 1.4 % 172 162.3 % Net revenues $ 282 $ 278 $ 107 $ 4 1.4 % $ 171 159.8 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 84 $ 87 $ 25 $ (3) (3.4) % $ 62 * Adjusted EBITDA margin 29.8 % 31.3 % 23.4 % (1.5) pts 7.9 pts Net income (loss) attributable to Caesars $ (301) $ 68 $ 29 $ (369) * $ 39 134.5 % ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n* Not meaningful. \n\nWe manage several properties and license rights to the use of our brands.

Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income or interest expense net of interest capitalized, (benefit) provision for income taxes, unrealized (gain) loss on investments and marketable securities, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, equity in (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, (gain) loss related to divestitures, changes in the fair value of certain derivatives and transaction costs associated with our acquisitions and divestitures such as (gain) loss on sale, sign-on and retention bonuses, severance expense, business integration and optimization costs, contract exit or termination costs, certain litigation awards and settlements, losses on inventory associated with properties temporarily closed as a result of \n\nthe COVID-19 public health emergency, and certain regulatory settlements. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the expense associated with certain of our leases as these transactions were accounted for as financing obligations and the associated expense is included in interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, payments under our leases with affiliates of VICI Properties Inc. and GLPI and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements. \n\nThe following table summarizes our Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in addition to reconciling net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with GAAP (unaudited): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net loss attributable to Caesars $ (899) $ (1,019) $ (1,757) Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (11) 3 (1) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes 386 30 20 (Benefit) provision for income taxes (41) (283) 132 \n\nOther (income) loss (a) \n\n(46) 198 (176) Loss on extinguishment of debt 85 236 197 Interest expense, net 2,265 2,295 1,202 Impairment charges 108 102 215 Depreciation and amortization 1,205 1,126 583 \n\nTransaction costs and other (b) \n\n90 220 300 Stock-based compensation expense 101 82 79 Adjusted EBITDA 3,243 2,990 794 \n\nPre-consolidation, pre-acquisition, and pre-disposition EBITDA, net (c) \n\n&#8212; 3 261 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,243 $ 2,993 $ 1,055 ##TABLE_END ____________________ \n\n(a) Other (income) loss primarily includes the net changes in fair value of (i) investments held by the Company (ii) foreign exchange forward contracts (iii) the disputed claims liability related to Former Caesars&#8217; bankruptcy prior to the Merger, and (iv) the derivative liability related to the 5% Convertible Notes, which were fully converted during the year ended December 31, 2021, and the change in the foreign exchange rate associated with restricted cash held in GBP associated with our acquisition of William Hill. \n\n(b) Transaction costs and other primarily includes costs related to the William Hill Acquisition, the Merger, various contract or license termination exit costs, professional services for integration activities and non-cash changes in equity method investments partially offset by gains resulting from insurance proceeds received in excess of the respective carrying value of the assets damaged at Lake Charles by Hurricane Laura. \n\n(c) Results of operations for Horseshoe Baltimore for periods prior to the consolidation resulting from the Company&#8217;s increase in its ownership interest on August 26, 2021, William Hill prior to its acquisition on April 22, 2021, and Former Caesars prior to the Merger on July 20,2020 are added to Adjusted EBITDA. The results of operations for certain properties divested prior to divestiture are subtracted from Adjusted EBITDA. See Item 7 - Overview above. Such figures are based on unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company&#8217;s auditors for the periods presented. The additional financial information is included to enable the comparison of current results with results of prior periods. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nWe are a holding company and our only significant assets are ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Our ability to fund our obligations depends on existing cash on hand, contracted asset sales, cash flows from our subsidiaries and our ability to raise capital. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities and proceeds from completed asset sales. Our cash requirements may fluctuate significantly depending on our decisions with respect to business acquisitions or divestitures and strategic capital and marketing investments. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our cash on hand and revolving borrowing capacity were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,038 \n\nRevolver capacity (a) \n\n2,220 Revolver capacity committed to letters of credit (82) Revolver capacity committed as regulatory requirement (48) Total $ 3,128 ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(a) Revolver capacity includes $2.25 billion under our CEI Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, maturing in January 2028, less $40 million reserved for specific purposes, and $10 million under our Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility, as amended maturing in July 2023. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, our operating activities generated operating cash inflows of $1.0 billion, as compared to operating cash inflows of $1.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the results of operations described above. \n\nOn September 30, 2020, we announced that we had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by us or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On the acquisition date, our intent was to divest William Hill International, which was held for sale as of the date of the closing of the William Hill Acquisition with such operations reflected within discontinued operations. On April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for &#163;2.9 billion , or approximately $3.9 billion . \n\nOn September 8, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately &#163;2.2 billion. In order to manage the risk of changes in the GBP denominated sales price and expected proceeds, the Company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts. On April 7, 2022, we amended the agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for a revised enterprise value of approximately &#163;2.0 billion. The amended agreement reflected a &#163;250 million reduction in consideration payable at closing and up to &#163;100 million as deferred consideration to be paid to us, subject to 888 Holdings Plc meeting certain 2023 financial targets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairments to assets held for sale of $503 million within discontinued operations based on the revised and final sales prices. \n\nOn July 1, 2022, we completed the sale of William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc and outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement were immediately repaid. After the repayment of the Bridge Credit Agreement, other permitted leakage, and the settlement of related forward contracts, we received net proceeds of $730 million. Including open market repurchases and repayments, we utilized all $730 million to reduce our outstanding debt. \n\nOn October 5, 2022, we entered into a third amendment to the CEI Credit Agreement (the &#8220;Third Amendment&#8221;) which provided for an aggregate principal amount of $750 million senior secured term loan (the &#8220;CEI Term Loan A&#8221; and together with the CEI Revolving Credit Facility, as so amended, the &#8220;Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility,&#8221; the &#8220;Senior Credit Facilities&#8221;) as a new term loan under the credit agreement, increased the aggregate principal amount of the CEI Revolving Credit Facility to $2.25 billion and made certain other amendments to the credit agreement. Both the Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility and the CEI Term Loan A mature on January 31, 2028, subject to a springing maturity in the event our certain other long-term debt is not extended or repaid. The Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility of $388 million. Concurrently with the closing of the Senior Credit Facilities, we terminated the CRC Revolving Credit Facility and utilized the entire proceeds of the CEI Term Loan A of $750 million to make a partial prepayment of the outstanding principal balance of the CRC Term Loan. \n\nOn February 6, 2023, the Company issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior secured notes (the &#8220;CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030&#8221;) pursuant to an indenture by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent. The CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030 rank equally with all existing and future first-priority lien obligations of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. The CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030 will mature in February 2030, with interest paid semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2023. \n\nAdditionally, on February 6, 2023, Caesars entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 2 pursuant to which the Company incurred a new senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion (the &#8220;CEI Term Loan B&#8221;) as a new term loan under the CEI Credit Agreement. The Term Loan B requires scheduled quarterly amortization payments in amounts equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the CEI Term Loan B, with the balance payable at maturity. Borrowings under the CEI Term Loan B bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company&#8217;s option, either (a) a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate for the applicable interest period plus an adjustment of 0.10% per annum (&#8220;Adjusted Term SOFR&#8221;), subject to a floor of 0.50% or (b) a base rate (the &#8220;Base Rate&#8221;) determined by reference to the highest of (i) the rate of interest per annum last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the &#8220;Prime Rate&#8221; in the United States, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum and (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00% per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is 3.25% per annum in the case of any Adjusted Term SOFR loan and 2.25% per annum in the case of any Base Rate loan, subject to one 0.25% step-down based on the Company&#8217;s net total leverage ratio. The CEI Term Loan B was issued at a price of 99.0% of the principal amount and will mature in February 2030. \n\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030 and the net proceeds from the CEI Term Loan B were used to repay the outstanding principal balance, including accrued and unpaid interest, of both the CRC Term Loan and the CRC Incremental Term Loan. The remaining net proceeds were to be used to pay related fees, or for general corporate use. Upon the termination of the CRC Term Loan and the CRC Incremental Term Loan, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $200 million. \n\nWe expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the expansion and maintenance of our properties, taxes, servicing our outstanding indebtedness, and rent payments under our GLPI Master Lease, the VICI Leases and other leases. We make capital expenditures and perform continuing refurbishment and maintenance at our properties to maintain our quality standards. Our capital expenditure requirements for 2023 include expansion projects, the rebranding of certain properties, implementation and migration of states to our Liberty platform and continued investment into new markets with our Caesars Sportsbook and iGaming applications in our Caesars Digital segment. In addition, we may, from time to time, seek to repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. Any such purchases may be funded by existing cash balances or the incurrence of debt. The amount and timing of any repurchase will be based on business and market conditions, capital availability, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. \n\nWe continue to expand into new markets with projects such as our partnership with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to build and develop Caesars Virginia which is estimated to open in late 2024. The development has a budget of $650 million and is expected to include a premier destination resort casino along with a 500-room hotel and world-class casino floor including 1,300 slot machines, 85 live table games, a WSOP Poker Room, a Caesars Sportsbook, a live entertainment theater and 40,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. Additionally, Caesars announced plans to expand into Nebraska with the development of a Harrah&#8217;s casino and racetrack. The casino development is expected to feature a new one-mile horse racing surface, a 40,000-square-foot-casino and sportsbook with more than 400 slot machines and 20 table games, as well as a restaurant and retail space. During the construction of Caesars Virginia and Harrah&#8217;s in Nebraska, we anticipate opening and operating temporary facilities during 2023 while the permanent facilities are completed. \n\nIn 2020, we funded $400 million to escrow as of the closing of the Merger and have begun to utilize those funds in accordance with a three year capital expenditure plan in the state of New Jersey. This amount is currently included in restricted cash in Other assets, net. As of December 31, 2022, our restricted cash balance in the escrow account was $118 million for future capital expenditures in New Jersey. \n\nAs a condition of the extension of the casino operating contract and ground lease for Harrah&#8217;s New Orleans, we are also required to make a capital investment of $325 million in Harrah&#8217;s New Orleans by July 15, 2024. The capital investment is expected to include a renovation and full interior and exterior redesign, updated casino floor, new culinary experiences and a new 340-room hotel tower as we are also in the process of rebranding the property as Caesars New Orleans. The project has a current capital plan of approximately $430 million as of December 31, 2022. Total capital expenditures have been $112 million since the project began. \n\nOn August 27, 2020 , Hurricane Laura made landfall on Lake Charles as a Category 4 storm, severely damaged the Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we reached a final settlement agreement with the insurance carriers for a total amount of $128 million, before our insurance deductible of $25 million. We have received a total of $103 million related to damaged fixed assets, remediation costs and business interruption. The construction of our new land-based casino Horseshoe Lake Charles was completed and reopened in December 2022. \n\nCash spent for capital expenditures totaled $952 million, $520 million, $164 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to our growth, renovation, maintenance, and other capital projects. The following table summarizes our estimates for 2023 capital expenditures: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Low High Atlantic City $ 118 $ 118 Indiana racing operations &#8212; 10 Total estimated capital expenditures from restricted cash 118 128 Growth and renovation projects 445 465 Caesars Digital 105 115 Maintenance projects 250 310 Total estimated capital expenditures from unrestricted cash 800 890 \n\nCaesars Virginia (a) \n\n200 285 Total $ 1,118 $ 1,303 ##TABLE_END ___________________ \n\n(a) We expect to receive approximately $200 million from the combination of our temporary casino operations and contributions from our joint venture partners to support the development of Caesars Virginia. \n\nA significant portion of our liquidity needs are for debt service and payments associated with our leases. Our estimated debt service (including principal and interest) is approximately $1.0 billion for 2023 . We also lease certain real property assets from third parties, including VICI and GLPI. Our leases with VICI are subject to annual escalations based on the Consumer Price Index (&#8220;CPI&#8221;). The increase in the CPI over the prior year resulted in an increase in our annual lease payments to VICI, which took effect in November 2022. We estimate our lease payments to VICI and GLPI to be approximately $1.3 billion for 2023 . \n\nWe have periodically divested assets to raise capital or, in previous cases, to comply with conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by antitrust, gaming and other regulatory entities. In addition to the divestiture of William Hill International, as described above, on May 5, 2022, we consummated the sale of the equity interests of Baton Rouge to CQ Holding Company, Inc. \n\nOn April 6, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of the equity interests of MontBleu for $15 million. The purchase price was collected in April 2022. \n\nIf the agreed upon selling price for future divestitures does not exceed the carrying value of the assets, we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods which may be material. \n\nWe expect that our current liquidity, cash flows from operations, availability of borrowings under committed credit facilities and proceeds from the announced asset sales will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the next twelve months. \n\nDebt and Master Lease Covenant Compliance \n\nThe Senior Credit Facilities, the Baltimore Term Loan, the Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures related to the CEI Senior Secured Notes, the CEI Senior Notes due 2027, the CRC Senior Secured Notes and the CEI Senior Notes due 2029 contain covenants which are standard and customary for these types of agreements. These include negative covenants, which, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, limit our ability to (among other items) incur additional indebtedness, make investments, make restricted payments, including dividends, grant liens, sell assets and make acquisitions. \n\nThe Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility and the CEI Term Loan A include a maximum net total leverage ratio financial covenant of 7.25:1 until December 31, 2024 and 6.50:1 from and after December 31, 2024. In addition, the Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility and the CEI Term Loan A include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant of 1.75:1 until December 31, 2024 and 2.00:1 from and after December 31, 2024. From and after the repayment of the CEI Term Loan A, the financial covenants applicable to the Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility will be tested solely to the extent that certain testing conditions are satisfied. The Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility includes a net senior secured leverage ratio financial covenant of 5.0:1. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in an acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under the relevant debt document. \n\nThe GLPI Leases and VICI Leases contain certain covenants requiring minimum capital expenditures based on a percentage of net revenues along with maintaining certain financial ratios. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the applicable financial covenants described above. \n\nShare Repurchase Program \n\nOn November 8, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $150 million common stock repurchase program (the &#8220;Share Repurchase Program&#8221;) pursuant to which we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of common stock on the open market (either with or without a 10b5-1 plan) or through privately negotiated transactions. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that we are required to repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have acquired 223,823 shares of common stock under the program at an aggregate value of $9 million and an average of $40.80 per share. No shares were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nDebt Obligations and Leases \n\nBaltimore Term Loan and Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility \n\nAs a result of our increased ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore, we began to consolidate the aggregate principal amount of Horseshoe Baltimore&#8217;s senior secured term loan facility (the &#8220;Baltimore Term Loan&#8221;) and amount outstanding, if any, under Horseshoe Baltimore&#8217;s senior secured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;). The Baltimore Term Loan matures in July 2024 and is subject to a variable rate of interest calculated as LIBOR plus 4.00%. The Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility has borrowing capacity of up to $10 million, subject to a variable rate of interest calculated as Term SOFR plus 4.00% subject to one 0.25% step-down based on senior secured leverage ratio, the ratio of first lien senior secured net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. On June 24, 2022, we entered into an amendment related to the Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date to July 7, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, there was $10 million of available borrowing capacity under the Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility. On November 14, 2022, we made partial prepayment of $10 million of the outstanding principal balance of the Baltimore Term Loan. \n\nCRC Term Loans and CRC Revolving Credit Facility \n\nThe CRC Term Loan, the CRC Incremental Term Loan and the CRC Revolving Credit Facility were subject to the terms described below prior to termination or repayment. The CRC Revolving Credit Facility was terminated in October 2022 and on February 6, 2023, the Company repaid the CRC Term Loan and the CRC Incremental Term Loan with proceeds from a new CEI Term Loan B and new CEI Senior Secured Notes, both due 2030. See &#8220;Subsequent Amendment to the CEI Credit Agreement and issuance of New Senior Secured Notes&#8221; below. \n\nCRC was party to a credit agreement, dated as of December 22, 2017 (as amended, the &#8220;CRC Credit Agreement&#8221;), which provided for a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the &#8220;CRC Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;) an initial $4.7 billion seven-year senior secured term loan (the &#8220;CRC Term Loan&#8221;), and an incremental $1.8 billion five-year senior secured term loan that was incurred in connection with the Merger (the &#8220;CRC Incremental Term Loan&#8221;). \n\nThe CRC Term Loan had a maturity date in December 2024 and the CRC Incremental Term Loan had a maturity date in July 2025. The CRC Term Loan and the CRC Incremental Term Loan required scheduled quarterly principal payments in amounts equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount, with the balances due at maturity. The CRC Credit Agreement also included customary voluntary and mandatory prepayment provisions, subject to certain exceptions. \n\nThe CRC Revolving Credit Facility contained a maturity date in December 2022 and included a $400 million letter of credit sub-facility. \n\nBorrowings under the CRC Credit Agreement were subject to interest at a rate equal to either (a) LIBOR adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a floor of 0% or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate as determined by Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent under the CRC Credit Agreement and (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin. Such applicable margin shall be (a) with respect to the CRC Term Loan, 2.75% per annum in the case of any LIBOR loan or 1.75% per annum in the case of any base rate loan, and (b) with respect to the CRC Incremental Term Loan, 3.50% per annum in the case of any LIBOR loan or 2.50% in the case of any base rate loan. The CRC Term Loan and the CRC Incremental Term Loan were LIBOR based loans as of December 31, 2022. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company utilized and fully repaid borrowings on the CRC Revolving Credit Facility, prior to its termination. Additionally, the Company made several partial prepayments of outstanding principal of the CRC Term Loan utilizing operating cash flows totaling $300 million, excluding the prepayments resulting from the proceeds of \n\nthe CEI Term Loan A described below, and recognized a related $16 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nFollowing the closing of the sale of William Hill International, we utilized the proceeds from the sale, as well as cash on hand to make partial prepayments totaling $755 million of the outstanding principal of the CRC Incremental Term Loan and recognized a $27 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nOn October 5, 2022, in connection with the Third Amendment (as defined below) to the CEI Credit Agreement, we utilized the entire proceeds of a new $750 million CEI Term Loan A (as defined below) to make a partial prepayment of the outstanding principal of the CRC Term Loan, as well as terminate the CRC Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of the partial prepayment, we recognized a $41 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt. See below. \n\nCEI Term Loan A and CEI Revolving Credit Facility \n\nCEI is party to a credit agreement, dated as of July 20, 2020, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent, and certain banks and other financial institutions and lenders party thereto (the &#8220;CEI Credit Agreement&#8221;) which provided for a five-year CEI Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion (the &#8220;CEI Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;). The CEI Revolving Credit Facility contained reserves of $190 million which are available only for certain permitted uses. On May 23, 2022, the Company obtained approval for a reduction of $150 million in required reserves. Prior to the amendment described below, the CEI Revolving Credit Facility was scheduled to mature in July 2025 and included a letter of credit sub-facility of $250 million. \n\nPrior to the Third Amendment (as defined below) of the CEI Credit Agreement on October 5, 2022, the interest rate per annum applicable under the CEI Revolving Credit Facility, at the Company&#8217;s option is either (a) LIBOR adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a floor of 0% or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) rate of interest per annum last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the &#8220;Prime Rate&#8221; in the United States and (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin. Such applicable margin was 3.25% per annum in the case of any LIBOR loan and 2.25% per annum in the case of any base rate loan, subject to three 0.25% step-downs based on the Company&#8217;s net total leverage ratio. \n\nAdditionally, prior to the Third Amendment (as defined below) of the CEI Credit Agreement, we were required to pay a commitment fee in respect of any unused commitments under the CEI Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of 0.50% per annum, subject to a step-down to 0.375% per annum based upon the Company&#8217;s net total leverage ratio. We were also required to pay customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer&#8217;s customary documentary and processing fees and charges and a fronting fee in an amount equal to 0.125% per annum of the daily stated amount of such letter of credit. \n\nOn October 5, 2022, Caesars entered into a Third Amendment to the CEI Credit Agreement pursuant to which the Company (a) incurred a senior secured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (the &#8220;CEI Term Loan A&#8221;) as a new term loan under the credit agreement, (b) amended and extended the CEI Revolving Credit Facility under the CEI Credit Agreement (the CEI Revolving Credit Facility, as so amended, the &#8220;Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility&#8221; and, together with the CEI Term Loan A, the &#8220;Senior Credit Facilities&#8221;), (c) increased the aggregate principal amount of the CEI Revolving Credit Facility to $2.25 billion, and (d) made certain other amendments to the CEI Credit Agreement. Both the Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility and the new CEI Term Loan A mature on January 31, 2028, subject to a springing maturity in the event certain other long-term debt of Caesars is not extended or repaid. The Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility of $388 million. The CEI Term Loan A requires scheduled quarterly payments in amounts equal to 1.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the CEI Term Loan A, with the balance payable at maturity. The Company may make voluntary prepayments of the CEI Term Loan A at any time prior to maturity at par. \n\nBorrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company&#8217;s option, either (a) a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) for the applicable interest period plus an adjustment of 0.10% per annum (&#8220;Adjusted Term SOFR&#8221;), subject to a floor of 0% or (b) a base rate (the &#8220;Base Rate&#8221;) determined by reference to the highest of (i) the rate of interest per annum last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the &#8220;Prime Rate&#8221; in the United States, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum and (iii) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00% per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is 2.25% per annum in the case of any Adjusted Term SOFR loan and 1.25% per annum in the case of any Base Rate loan, subject to three 0.25% step-downs based on the Company&#8217;s net total leverage ratio. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company is required to pay each lender under the Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility a commitment fee in respect of any unused commitments under the Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of 0.35% per annum of the principal amount of the unused commitments of such lender, subject to three 0.05% step-downs based on the Company&#8217;s net total leverage ratio. \n\nAs a December 31, 2022, we had $2.1 billion of available borrowing capacity under the Amended CEI Revolving Credit Facility, after consideration of $82 million in outstanding letters of credit, $48 million committed for regulatory purposes and the reserves described above. \n\nSubsequent Amendment to the CEI Credit Agreement and issuance of New Senior Secured Notes \n\nOn February 6, 2023, the Company issued new $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior secured notes (the &#8220;CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030&#8221;) pursuant to an indenture by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent. The CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030 rank equally with all existing and future first-priority lien obligations of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. The CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030 will mature in February 2030, with interest paid semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2023. \n\nAdditionally, on February 6, 2023, Caesars entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 2 pursuant to which the Company incurred a new senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion (the &#8220;CEI Term Loan B&#8221;) as a new term loan under the CEI Credit Agreement. The CEI Term Loan B was issued at a price of 99.0% of the principal amount and will mature in February 2030. Interest under the CEI Term Loan B is based on the forward looking SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10%, subject to a floor of 0.50%, plus an applicable margin of 3.25% which is subject to one 0.25% step-down based on the Company&#8217;s net total leverage ratio. \n\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030 and the net proceeds from the CEI Term Loan B, were used to repay the outstanding principal balance, including accrued and unpaid interest, of both the CRC Term Loan and the CRC Incremental Term Loan. The remaining net proceeds were to be used to pay related fees, or for general corporate use. Upon the termination of the CRC Term Loan and the CRC Incremental Term Loan, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $200 million. \n\nCRC Senior Secured Notes due 2025 \n\nOn July 6, 2020, Colt Merger Sub, Inc. (the &#8220;Escrow Issuer&#8221;) issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 pursuant to an indenture, dated July 6, 2020 (the &#8220;CRC Senior Secured Notes&#8221;), by and among the Escrow Issuer, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as collateral agent. In connection with the consummation of the Merger, CRC assumed the rights and obligations under the CRC Senior Secured Notes and the indenture governing such notes. The CRC Senior Secured Notes rank equally with all existing and future first priority lien obligations of CRC, CRC Finco, Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors. The CRC Senior Secured Notes will mature on July 1, 2025 with interest payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased a total of $11 million in principal amount of the CRC Senior Secured Notes. \n\nCEI Senior Secured Notes due 2025 \n\nOn July 6, 2020, the Escrow Issuer issued $3.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 pursuant to an indenture dated July 6, 2020 (the &#8220;CEI Senior Secured Notes&#8221;), by and among the Escrow Issuer, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent. The Company assumed the rights and obligations under the CEI Senior Secured Notes and the indenture governing such notes on July 20, 2020. The CEI Senior Secured Notes rank equally with all existing and future first-priority lien obligations of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. The CEI Senior Secured Notes will mature on July 1, 2025 with interest payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year. \n\nConvention Center Mortgage Loan \n\nOn September 18, 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with VICI to borrow a 5-year, $400 million Forum Convention Center mortgage loan (the &#8220;Mortgage Loan&#8221;). The Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate of, initially, 7.7% per annum, which escalates annually on the anniversary of the closing date to a maximum interest rate of 8.3% per annum. \n\nCEI Senior Notes due 2027 \n\nOn July 6, 2020, the Escrow Issuer issued $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2027 pursuant to an indenture, dated July 6, 2020 (the &#8220;CEI Senior Notes due 2027&#8221;), by and between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. We assumed the rights and obligations under the CEI Senior Notes due 2027 and the indenture governing such notes on July 20, 2020. The CEI Senior Notes due 2027 rank equally with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. The CEI Senior Notes due 2027 will mature on July 1, 2027 with interest payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased a total of $89 million in principal amount of the CEI Senior Notes due 2027. \n\nCEI Senior Notes due 2029 \n\nOn September 24, 2021, we issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029 (the &#8220;CEI Senior Notes due 2029&#8221;) pursuant to an indenture dated as of September 24, 2021 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. The CEI Senior Notes due 2029 rank equally with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. The CEI Senior Notes due 2029 will mature on October 15, 2029 with interest payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year, which began on April 15, 2022. \n\nVICI Leases \n\nCEI leases certain real property assets from VICI under the following agreements: (i) for a portfolio of properties located throughout the United States (the &#8220;Regional Lease&#8221;), (ii) for Caesars Palace Las Vegas and Harrah&#8217;s Las Vegas (the &#8220;Las Vegas Lease&#8221;), and (iii) for Harrah&#8217;s Joliet Hotel &#38; Casino (the &#8220;Joliet Lease&#8221;). The lease agreements, inclusive of all amendments, include (i) a 15-year initial term with four five-year renewal options, (ii) annual fixed rent payments of $1.1 billion, subject to annual escalation provisions based on the CPI and a 2% floor commencing in lease year two of the initial term and (iii) a variable element based on net revenues of the underlying leased properties, commencing in lease year eight of the initial term. \n\nThe Regional Lease includes a put-call option whereby the Company may require VICI to purchase and lease back (as lessor) or whereby VICI may require the Company to sell to VICI and lease back (as lessee) the real estate components of the gaming and racetrack facilities of Harrah&#8217;s Hoosier Park Racing &#38; Casino and Indiana Grand (&#8220;Centaur properties&#8221;). Election to exercise the option by either party must be made during the election period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2024. Upon either party exercising their option, the Centaur properties would be sold at a price in accordance with the agreement and leased back to CEI in accordance to the pre-existing terms of the Regional Lease. \n\nOur VICI Leases are accounted for as a financing obligation and totaled $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. See Note 10 to our Financial Statements for additional information about our VICI Leases and related matters. \n\nGLPI Leases \n\nThe GLPI Master Lease, encompassing a portfolio of properties within the United States, provides for the lease of land, buildings, structures and other improvements on the land (including barges and riverboats), easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements relating to the operation of the leased properties.

See Note 10 to our Financial Statements for additional information about our GLPI Leases and related matters. \n\nOther Liquidity Matters \n\nWe are faced with certain contingencies, from time to time, involving litigation, claims, assessments, environmental remediation or compliance. These commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in &#8220; Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings &#8221; and Note 11 to our Financial Statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, new competition among retail and online operations may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. See &#8220; Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business &#8221; which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving regard to materiality. When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate under specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Certain of our accounting policies, including those in connection with business combinations, income taxes, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain gaming receivables, self-insurance reserves, and litigation, claims and assessments require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. \n\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when: \n\n&#8226; the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and \n\n&#8226; different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position, or results of operations. \n\nBy their nature, these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information gathered from customer behavior, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving judgments and estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates. \n\nOur most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas: \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nWe applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 805, &#8220;Business Combinations,&#8221; in the accounting for our acquisitions of Former Caesars, William Hill PLC, and our additional interest in Horseshoe Baltimore. It required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, which were determined using market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is generally the result of expected synergies of the combined company or an assembled workforce. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets acquired primarily include trademarks, Caesars Rewards acquired in the Merger and gaming rights. The fair value for these intangible assets was determined using either the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach. \n\nAcquired trademarks, developed technology and Caesars Rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks, technology, or loyalty program, we would have to make a stream of payments to a third party in return for the right to use their name, technology, or program. By virtue of this asset, we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of the Company&#8217;s ownership of the brand name, technology, or program. \n\nCustomer relationships were valued using the cost approach and the incremental cash flow method under the income approach. The incremental cash flow method compares the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced. \n\nGaming rights include our gaming licenses in various jurisdictions and may have indefinite lives or an estimated useful life. The fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings or replacement cost methodology, based on whether the license resides in gaming jurisdictions where competition is limited to a specified number of licensed gaming operators. The excess earnings methodology is an income approach that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The replacement cost of the gaming license was used as an indicator of fair value. \n\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the acquisition date. Assets and liabilities held for sale were recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, based on the agreements reached as of the acquisition date, or an income approach. \n\nThe fair value of the financing obligations was calculated as the net present value of both the fixed base rent payments and the forecasted variable payments plus the expected residual value of the land and building returned at the end of the expected usage period. \n\nReacquired rights were valued using the excess earnings method that reflects the present value of the future profit William Hill expected to earn over the remaining term of the contract, adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit, such as working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The forecasted profit used within the valuation was adjusted for the settlement of the preexisting relationship as a component of the purchase consideration. \n\nFair value of land was determined using the sales comparable approach. The market data is then adjusted for any significant differences, to the extent known, between the identified comparable sites and the site being valued. The value of building and site improvements was estimated via the income approach. Other personal property assets such as furniture, gaming and computer equipment, fixtures, computer software, and restaurant equipment were valued using the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset. The cost approach is an estimation of fair value developed by computing the current cost of replacing a property and subtracting any depreciation resulting from one or more of the following factors: physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and/or economic obsolescence. \n\nAssets and liabilities which are designated as held for sale on an acquisition date are also measured at fair value, utilizing similar market, income and cost approaches described above, based on the underlying asset class held for sale. \n\nCash flow estimates are significant to many valuations described above and may include forecasts with assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, future growth rates, and the determination of appropriate discount rates to estimate fair value. These inputs involve significant assumptions including the future effects of COVID-19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from a business combination, which may not be realized as projected. Certain assumptions may be beyond our control. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See Note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities. \n\nWe record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. \n\nWhen there is a recent history of operating losses and negative normalized earnings and a return to operating profitability has not yet been demonstrated, we cannot rely on projections of future taxable earnings for purposes of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets. In such cases, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. Our most significant deferred tax asset relates to the failed sale-leaseback obligation with VICI and GLPI (see Note 10). The reversal of this deferred tax asset requires judgment and estimates and has a material impact on the determination of the amount of valuation allowance required. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively and federal general business tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards of $129 million, which will expire on various dates as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year of Expiration Net Operating Losses Tax Credits (In millions) Federal States Federal 2023-2027 &#8212; 530 &#8212; 2028-2032 914 1,376 39 2033-2042 589 5,030 90 Do not expire 437 2,219 &#8212; $ 1,940 $ 9,155 $ 129 ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, total federal and state deferred tax assets are $4.2 billion of which we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the associated benefit will not be realized and, as a result, we have provided for a valuation allowance of $1.8 billion. However, we have recently observed positive trends in our operating results and if these trends continue, in the foreseeable future we may determine that we will be able to realize a significant portion of these deferred tax assets. A future reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets could result in an income tax benefit of $0.9 billion to $1.2 billion. \n\nUnder the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The accounting standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. \n\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets \n\nAssessing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative business-specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments. \n\nWe determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of EBITDA, valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. We also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in our industry. \n\nWe determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method under the income approach or replacement cost market approach. The determination of fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates around the forecasts as well as the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples. Changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units, intangible assets and result in potential impairment. \n\nForecasts and the determination of appropriate discount rates and valuation multiples used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involves significant assumptions and estimates. Assumptions include those used to assess future effects of COVID-19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from acquisitions which may not be realized at the projected rate. \n\nWe completed our annual impairment tests as of October 1, 2022. The estimated fair values of certain of our indefinite lived intangible assets and reporting units decreased primarily due to an increase in the related discount rates, which represents the higher required cost of capital as a result of the macroeconomic environment and projected outlook. Accordingly, we identified one reporting unit with which the estimated fair value of the associated gaming rights was less than the carrying value and we recorded an impairment of $30 million. In addition, we identified two reporting units with which the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit was below the carrying value and we recorded a total impairment of $78 million to goodwill. These reporting units are all within the Regional segment. \n\nAs of October 1, 2022, one reporting unit in the Las Vegas segment and four reporting units in the Regional segment with goodwill totaling $625 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, had fair values that did not significantly exceed their respective \n\ncarrying values. In addition, we identified trademarks totaling $286 million in the Las Vegas segment, $180 million in the Caesars Digital segment, and gaming rights totaling $173 million in the Regional segment that do not significantly exceed their respective carrying values. The reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets with carrying values that do not significantly exceed their estimated fair values are primarily assets acquired in the Merger when our discount rate was approximately 9.5%. The discount rate used in our annual impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 was approximately 11.5%. To the extent gaming volumes deteriorate in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or we do not meet our projected performance, we may recognize further impairments, and such impairments could be material. The discount rate represents the most sensitive input in our estimates and an increase of 1% to the discount rate would result in additional impairments of approximately $125 million on the assets that do not significantly exceed their carrying values. In addition, $468 million of goodwill within our Regional segment is associated with reporting units with zero or negative carrying value. See Note 7 for additional information. \n\nLong-Lived Assets \n\nWe have significant capital invested in our long-lived assets, and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets, and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset. We assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy, which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, planned construction and renovation projects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic, legal, and regulatory factors. In estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which, for most of our assets, is the individual property. See Note 6 for additional information. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts - Gaming \n\nWe reserve an estimated amount for gaming receivables that may not be collected to reduce the Company&#8217;s receivables to their net carrying amount. Methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. Historical collection rates and reasonable forecasts are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves to reflect current expected credit loss. As with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2022, a 5% increase or decrease to the allowance determined based on a percentage of aged receivables would change the reserve by approximately $15 million. \n\nSelf-Insurance Reserves \n\nWe are self-insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers&#8217; compensation coverage. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. We utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities. While the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments, in managements&#8217; opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments. Self-insurance reserves for employee medical claims, workers&#8217; compensations and general liability claims are included self-insurance claims and reserves within Accrued other liabilities on the Balance Sheets. \n\nThe assumptions, including those related to the COVID-19 public health emergency, utilized by our actuaries are subject to significant uncertainty and if outcomes differ from these assumptions or events develop or progress in a negative manner, the Company could experience a material adverse effect and additional liabilities may be recorded in the future. \n\nLitigation, Claims and Assessments \n\nWe utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. These estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. If our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \n\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our Financial Statements, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8211; Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements , in the Notes. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate long-term debt arrangements. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the face value of our long-term debt was $13.1 billion, including variable-rate long-term borrowings of $5.4 billion. No amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. \n\nAs a result of the Merger, we assumed interest rate swaps to manage the mix of debt between fixed and variable rate instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had four interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on $1.3 billion of variable rate debt related to the CRC Credit Agreement. The interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements was accrued as interest rates changed and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense at settlement. The term of the interest rate swaps ended on December 31, 2022. \n\nWe do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. \n\nThe table below provides information as of December 31, 2022 about our fixed rate and variable rate financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including the cash flows associated with amortization and average interest rates. Principal amounts are used to calculate the payments to be exchanged under the related agreements and average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of December 31, 2022 and should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates. \n\n##TABLE_START Expected Maturity Date (Dollars in millions) 2023 2024 (a) \n\n2025 (a) \n\n2026 2027 Thereafter Total Fair Value Liabilities Long-term debt Fixed rate $ 2 $ 2 $ 4,792 $ 2 $ 1,613 $ 1,238 $ 7,649 $ 7,298 Average interest rate 4.3 % 4.3 % 6.3 % 4.3 % 8.1 % 4.6 % 6.4 % Variable rate $ 106 $ 3,688 $ 1,005 $ 38 $ 38 $ 561 $ 5,436 $ 5,377 Average interest rate 7.1 % 7.2 % 7.8 % 6.7 % 6.7 % 6.7 % 7.3 % ##TABLE_END ____________________ \n\n(a) Maturities of $3.4 billion in 2024 and $1.0 billion in 2025 of variable rate debt were repaid with the net proceeds of the $2.5 billion CEI Term Loan B and the $2.0 billion CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities were variable-rate borrowings. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in LIBOR and Term SOFR, our annual interest cost would change by $54 million based on gross amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022. \n\nLIBOR was discontinued by lending institutions for new debt agreements and after June 30, 2023 no additional LIBOR rates are expected to be available. We have variable rate debt instruments which are subject to LIBOR and Term SOFR interest rates plus a reasonable margin. Our CRC Term Loan and CRC Incremental Term loan are LIBOR based loans as of December 31, 2022. As previously described, subsequent to December 31, 2022 we repaid both our CRC Term Loan and CRC Incremental Term Loan and our interest rate swaps matured on December 31, 2022. \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risks \n\nWe entered into several foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates between USD and GBP. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a gain of $73 million and $23 million, respectively , related to forward contracts, which was recorded in the Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations. All forward contracts have been settled as of July 1, 2022. \n\n"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating a critical audit matter, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets &#8211; Refer to Note 7 to the Financial Statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;), valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. The Company also evaluates the aggregate fair value of all the reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, expenditures associated with obtaining racing and gaming licenses, and Caesars Rewards. The Company uses the Excess Earnings Method and Cost Approach to determine the estimated fair value of gaming rights and uses the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of trademarks and Caesars Rewards. \n\nThe Company performed its annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2022. The Company&#8217;s goodwill balance was $11,004 million as of December 31, 2022, of which $625 million and $1.1 billion was related to one reporting unit in the Las Vegas segment and four reporting units in the Regional segment, respectively, which had estimated fair values that did not significantly exceed their respective carrying values. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangibles balance was $3,654 million as of December 31, 2022, of which trademarks totaling $286 million and $180 million in the Las Vegas and Caesars Digital segments, respectively, and gaming rights totaling $173 million in the Regional segment, had estimated fair values that do not significantly exceed their respective carrying values. \n\nThe determination of fair value of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates around forecasts and the selection of discount rates. Therefore, our audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management&#8217;s forecasts required a higher degree of auditor judgment as well as an increased level of audit effort and the need to use more experienced audit professionals. In addition, the selection of discount rates involved a higher degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity as well as an increased level of audit effort, including the involvement of valuation specialists. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to management&#8217;s forecasts and the selection of discount rates used by management to determine the fair value of the Company&#8217;s reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal controls over the forecasts and the selection of discount rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated management&#8217;s ability t o accurately forecast by comparing actual results to management&#8217;s historical forecasts. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the assumptions and estimates included in management&#8217;s forecasts by: 1) comparing the forecasts to information included in the Company&#8217;s communications to the Board of Directors, gaming industry reports, and analyst reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies; 2) conducting inquiries with property management; 3) considering the impact of changes in the competitive and regulatory environment on management&#8217;s projections; 4) assessing the reasonableness of strategic plans incorporated by management into the projections and 5) evaluating management&#8217;s estimate of the impact of any related expansion of gaming activities by analyzing historical information. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the discount rates selected by management, including assessing the impact of the uncertainty in the forecasts on the discount rates, testing the market-based source information underlying the selection of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the discount rate calculations, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nLas Vegas, Nevada \n\nFebruary 21, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2020. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except par value) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,038 &#160;

References to numbered &#8220;Notes&#8221; refer to Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. \n\nNote 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation \n\nOrganization \n\nThe Company is a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, the Company grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. in 2017, Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018 and a merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (&#8220;Former Caesars&#8221;) on July 20, 2020, pursuant to which Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) and the Company changed the Company&#8217;s ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market from &#8220;ERI&#8221; to &#8220;CZR&#8221;. \n\nOn April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC (the &#8220;William Hill Acquisition&#8221;). See below for further discussion of the William Hill Acquisition. \n\nThe Company owns, leases, brands or manages an aggregate of 51 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 52,800 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,800 table games and approximately 47,200 hotel rooms as of December 31, 2022. The Company operates and conducts sports wagering across 28 jurisdictions in North America, 20 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operates regulated online real money gaming businesses in six jurisdictions in North America. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. The Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue is generated by our casino properties&#8217; gaming operations, including retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming, and the Company utilizes its hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to its properties. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations for retail and mobile sports betting, online casino, and online poker are included under the Caesars Digital segment. The Company has made significant investments into the interactive business in recent years with the completion of the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and strategic expansion into new markets as legalization permits. The Company utilized significant marketing campaigns with distinguished actors, athletes and media personalities promoting the launch of the Caesars Sportsbook app. The app offers numerous pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Caesars Sportsbook has partnerships with the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB while being the exclusive odds provider for ESPN and CBS Sports. The Company has continued to create new partnerships among professional sports teams and, in 2021, entered into a 20 -year exclusive naming-rights partnership branding the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The Company expects to continue to expand its operations in the Caesars Digital segment as new jurisdictions legalize retail and online gaming and sports betting. \n\nThe Company has divested certain properties and other assets, including non-core properties and divestitures required by regulatory agencies. See Note 4 for a discussion of properties recently sold and Note 19 for segment information. \n\nWilliam Hill Acquisition \n\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which the Company would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On the acquisition date, the Company&#8217;s intent was to divest William Hill PLC&#8217;s non-U.S. operations, including the United Kingdom and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, &#8220;William Hill International&#8221;), all of which were held for sale as of the date of the closing of the William Hill Acquisition with such operations reflected within discontinued operations. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for &#163; 2.9 billion, or approximately $ 3.9 billion . See Note 3. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nOn September 8, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately &#163; 2.2 billion. On April 7, 2022, the Company amended the agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for a revised enterprise value of approximately &#163; 2.0 billion. The amended agreement reflected a &#163; 250 million reduction in consideration payable at closing and up to &#163; 100 million in deferred consideration to be paid to the Company, subject to 888 Holdings Plc meeting certain 2023 financial targets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairments to assets held for sale of $ 503 million within discontinued operations based on the revised and final sales prices. \n\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc and outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement between the Company and certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, were immediately repaid. After the repayment of the Bridge Credit Agreement, other permitted leakage, and the settlement of related forward contracts, Caesars received net proceeds of $ 730 million. Including open market repurchases and repayments, the Company utilized all $ 730 million to reduce the Company&#8217;s outstanding debt. See Note 12. \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nOur Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined. Actual amounts could materially differ from those estimates. \n\nThe presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company&#8217;s acquisitions or before divestitures of various properties is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective purchase or after the sale dates. See Note 3 for further discussion of the acquisitions and related transactions and Note 4 for properties recently sold. \n\nConsolidation of Subsidiaries and Variable Interest Entities \n\nOur Financial Statements include the accounts of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. \n\nWe consolidate all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) for which we or one of our consolidated subsidiaries is the primary beneficiary. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby (i) affiliates that are more than 50% owned are consolidated; (ii) investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method where we have determined that we have significant influence over the entities; and (iii) investments in affiliates of 20% or less are generally accounted for as investments in equity securities. \n\nWe consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the results of the VIE and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We review investments for VIE consideration if a reconsideration event occurs to determine if the investment qualifies, or continues to qualify, as a VIE. If we determine an investment qualifies, or no longer qualifies, as a VIE, there may be a material effect to our Financial Statements. \n\nDevelopments Related to COVID-19 \n\nDespite the resurgence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant at the beginning of the year, operations at many of our properties experienced positive trends during much of the year ended December 31, 2022, including higher hotel occupancy, particularly in Las Vegas, and increased gaming and food and beverage volumes. The reduction in mandates and restrictions, combined with pent up consumer demand and supplemental discretionary spend from governmental stimulus, resulted in strong results across our properties during 2021. Future variants, mandates or restrictions imposed by various regulatory bodies are uncertain and could have a significant impact on our future operations. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nAdditional significant accounting policy disclosures are provided within the applicable Notes to the Financial Statements. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash equivalents include investments in money market funds that can be redeemed immediately at the current net asset value per share. A money market fund is a mutual fund whose investments are primarily in short-term debt securities designed to maximize current income with liquidity and capital preservation, usually maintaining per share net asset value at a constant amount, such as one dollar. Cash and cash equivalents also include cash maintained for gaming operations. The carrying amounts approximate the fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments (Level 1). \n\nRestricted Cash \n\nRestricted cash includes certificates of deposit and similar instruments that are subject to remeasurement on a recurring basis (see Note 8) and cash deposits which are restricted under certain operating agreements or restricted for future capital expenditures in the normal course of business. \n\nAdvertising \n\nAdvertising costs are expensed in the period the advertising initially takes place. Advertising costs were $ 571 million, $ 518 million and $ 64 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included within operating expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company launched significant television, radio and internet marketing campaigns promoting the Caesars Sportsbook. Advertising costs related to the Caesars Digital segment are primarily recorded in Casino expense. \n\nInterest Expense, Net \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 2,303 &#160; $ 2,320 &#160; $ 1,213 &#160; Capitalized interest ( 26 ) ( 9 ) ( 1 ) Interest income ( 12 ) ( 16 ) ( 10 ) Total interest expense, net $ 2,265 &#160; $ 2,295 &#160; $ 1,202 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \n\nPronouncements Implemented in 2022 \n\nEffective January 1, 2022, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2020-04 (amended through December 2022), Reference Rate Reform.

Such application is not expected to have a material effect on our Financial Statements. \n\nNote 3. Acquisitions, Purchase Price Accounting and Pro forma Information \n\nAcquisition of William Hill \n\nOn April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for cash consideration of approximately &#163; 2.9 billion , or approximately $ 3.9 billion , based on the GBP to USD exchange rate on the closing date. \n\nWe acquired William Hill PLC and its U.S. subsidiary, William Hill U.S. Holdco (&#8220;William Hill US&#8221; and together with William Hill PLC, &#8220;William Hill&#8221;) to better position the Company to address the extensive usage of digital platforms, continued legalization in additional states and jurisdictions, and growing bettor demand, which are driving the market for online sports betting platforms in the U.S. In addition, we continue to leverage the World Series of Poker (&#8220;WSOP&#8221;) brand, and license the WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and services across these digital platforms. At the time that the William Hill Acquisition was consummated, the Company&#8217;s intent was to divest William Hill International. \n\nOn September 8, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately &#163; 2.2 billion. On April 7, 2022, the Company amended the agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for a revised enterprise value of approximately &#163; 2.0 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairments to assets held for sale of $ 503 million within discontinued operations based on the revised and final sales prices. On July 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company accounted for its investment in William Hill PLC as an investment in equity securities and William Hill US as an equity method investment. Accordingly, the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages, or a &#8220;step acquisition.&#8221; \n\nAs mentioned above, the total purchase consideration for William Hill was approximately $ 3.9 billion . The purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value. \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Consideration \n\nCash for outstanding William Hill common stock (a) \n\n$ 3,909 &#160; Fair value of William Hill equity awards 30 &#160; Settlement of preexisting relationships (net of receivable/payable) 7 &#160; Settlement of preexisting relationships (net of previously held equity investment and off-market settlement) ( 34 ) Total purchase consideration $ 3,912 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) William Hill common stock of approximately 1.0 billion shares as of the acquisition date was paid at &#163; 2.72 per share, or approximately $ 3.77 per share using the GBP to USD exchange rate on the acquisition date. \n\nFinal Purchase Price Allocation \n\nThe fair values are based on management&#8217;s analysis, including work performed by third-party valuation specialists, and were finalized over the one-year measurement period. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of William Hill, with the excess recorded as goodwill as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Fair Value Other current assets $ 164 &#160; Assets held for sale 4,337 &#160; Property and equipment, net 55 &#160; Goodwill 1,154 &#160; \n\nIntangible assets (a) \n\n565 &#160; Other noncurrent assets 317 &#160; Total assets $ 6,592 &#160; Other current liabilities $ 242 &#160; \n\nLiabilities related to assets held for sale (b) \n\n2,142 &#160; Deferred income taxes 251 &#160; Other noncurrent liabilities 35 &#160; Total liabilities 2,670 &#160; Noncontrolling interests 10 &#160; Net assets acquired $ 3,912 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) Intangible assets consist of gaming rights valued at $ 80 million, trademarks valued at $ 27 million, developed technology valued at $ 110 million, reacquired rights valued at $ 280 million and user relationships valued at $ 68 million. \n\n(b) Includes the fair value of debt of $ 1.1 billion related to William Hill International at the acquisition date. \n\nThe fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Valuation methodologies under both a market and income approach used for the identifiable net assets acquired in the William Hill Acquisition make use of Level 3 inputs, such as expected cash flows and projected financial results. The market approach indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets. \n\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the William Hill acquisition date. \n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale substantially represented William Hill International which was valued using a combination of approaches including a market approach based on valuation multiples and EBITDA, the relief from royalty method and the replacement cost method. In addition to the approaches described, our estimates were updated to reflect the sale price of William Hill International in the sale to 888 Holdings Plc, described above. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included certain investments in common stock. Investments with a publicly available share price were valued using the share price on the acquisition date. Investments without publicly available share data were valued at their carrying value, which approximated fair value. \n\nOther personal property assets such as furniture, equipment, computer hardware, and fixtures were valued using a cost approach which determined that the carrying values represented fair value of those items at the William Hill acquisition date. \n\nTrademarks and developed technology were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks or technology, the Company would have to make a series of payments to the assets&#8217; owner in return for the right to use their brand or technology. By virtue of their ownership of the respective intangible assets, the Company avoids any such payments and records the related intangible value. The estimated useful lives of the trademarks and developed technology were approximately 15 years and six years , respectively, from the acquisition date. \n\nOnline user relationships are valued using a cost approach based on the estimated marketing and promotional cost to acquire the new active user base if the user relationships were not already in place and needed to be replaced. We estimated the useful life of the user relationships to be approximately three years from the acquisition date. \n\nOperating agreements with non-Caesars entities allowed William Hill to operate retail and online sportsbooks as well as online gaming within certain states. These agreements were valued using the excess earnings method, estimating the projected profits of the business attributable to the rights afforded through the agreements, adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit, such as working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. We estimated the useful life of these operating agreements to be approximately 20 years from the acquisition date and have included them within amortizing gaming rights. \n\nThe reacquired rights intangible asset represents the estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s share of William Hill&#8217;s forecasted profits arising from the prior contractual arrangement with the Company to operate retail and online sportsbooks and online gaming. This fair value estimate was determined using the excess earnings method, an income-based approach that reflects the present value of the future profit William Hill expected to earn over the remaining term of the contract, adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit, such as working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The forecasted profit used within the valuation was adjusted for the settlement of the preexisting relationship in order to avoid double counting of the settlement. Reacquired rights are amortizable over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the rights were granted and estimated to be approximately 24 years from the acquisition date. \n\nGoodwill is the result of expected synergies from the operations of the combined company and future customer relationships including the brand names and strategic partner relationships of Caesars and the technology and assembled workforce of William Hill. The goodwill acquired will not generate amortization deductions for income tax purposes. \n\nThe fair value of long-term debt assumed was calculated based on market quotes. \n\nThe Company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $ 21 million, $ 68 million and $ 8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction costs associated with sale of William Hill International. These costs were associated with legal, professional services, and certain severance and retention costs and were primarily recorded in Transaction and other costs in our Statements of Operations. \n\nFor the period of April 22, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the operations of William Hill generated net revenues of $ 183 million, excluding discontinued operations (see Note 4), and a net loss of $ 415 million. \n\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information \n\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the William Hill Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma amounts include the historical operating results of the Company and William Hill prior to the acquisition, with adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition. The pro forma results include adjustments and consequential tax effects to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired, eliminate gains and losses related to certain investments and adjustments to the timing of acquisition related costs and expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results that would have occurred had the William Hill Acquisition been consummated as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of any future results. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Net revenues $ 9,696 &#160; $ 3,834 &#160; Net loss ( 893 ) ( 1,991 ) Net loss attributable to Caesars ( 896 ) ( 1,989 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore \n\nOn August 26, 2021 (the &#8220;Consolidation Date&#8221;), the Company increased its ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore, a property which it also manages, to approximately 75.8 % for cash consideration of $ 55 million. Our previously held investment was remeasured as of the date of the change in ownership and the Company recognized a gain of $ 40 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Subsequent to the change in ownership, the Company was determined to have a controlling financial interest and began to consolidate the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore. \n\nPrior to the purchase, the Company held an interest in Horseshoe Baltimore of approximately 44.3 % which was accounted for as an equity method investment. \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Consideration Cash for additional ownership interest $ 55 &#160; Preexisting relationships (net of receivable/payable) 18 &#160; Preexisting relationships (net of previously held equity investment) 81 &#160; Total purchase consideration $ 154 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nFinal Purchase Price Allocation \n\nThe fair values are based on management&#8217;s analysis, including work performed by a third-party valuation specialist, and were finalized over the one-year measurement period.

Valuation methodologies under both a market and income approach used for the identifiable net assets of Horseshoe Baltimore on the Consolidation Date make use of Level 3 inputs, such as expected cash flows and projected financial results. The market approach indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets. \n\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items on the Consolidation Date. \n\nOther personal property assets such as furniture, equipment, computer hardware, and fixtures were valued at the existing carrying values as they closely represented the estimated fair value of those items on the Consolidation Date. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nThe fair value of the buildings and improvements were estimated via the income approach. The remaining estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements on the Consolidation Date is 40 years. \n\nThe right of use asset and operating lease liability related to a ground lease for the site on which Horseshoe Baltimore is located was recorded at fair value and will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life due to changes in the underlying fair value and estimated remaining useful life of the building and improvements. Renewal options are considered to be reasonably certain. The income approach was used to determine fair value, based on the estimated present value of the future lease payments over the lease term, including renewal options, using an incremental borrowing rate of approximately 7.6 %. \n\nCustomer relationships are valued using an income approach, comparing the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced. We estimate the useful life of these customer relationships to be approximately seven years from the Consolidation Date. \n\nThe fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings method, which is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The acquired gaming rights are considered to have an indefinite life. \n\nThe goodwill acquired will generate amortization deductions for income tax purposes. \n\nThe fair value of long-term debt has been calculated based on market quotes. \n\nFor the period of August 26, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore generated net revenues of $ 72 million, and a net income of $ 4 million. \n\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information \n\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the Horseshoe Baltimore consolidation as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma amounts include the historical operating results of the Company and Horseshoe Baltimore prior to the consolidation. The pro forma results include adjustments and consequential tax effects to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and the adjustments to eliminate certain revenues and expenses which are considered intercompany activities. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would have occurred had the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore occurred as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of any future results. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the consolidation. \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Net revenues $ 9,693 &#160; $ 3,764 &#160; Net loss ( 1,049 ) ( 1,784 ) Net loss attributable to Caesars ( 1,056 ) ( 1,778 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nMerger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation \n\nOn July 20, 2020, the Merger was consummated and Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The strategic rationale for the Merger includes, but is not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; Creation of the largest owner, operator and manager of domestic gaming assets \n\n&#8226; Diversification of the Company&#8217;s domestic footprint \n\n&#8226; Access to iconic brands, rewards programs and new gaming opportunities expected to enhance customer experience \n\n&#8226; Realization of significant identified synergies \n\nThe total purchase consideration for Former Caesars was $ 10.9 billion. The estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Consideration Cash consideration paid $ 6,090 &#160; \n\nShares issued to Former Caesars shareholders (a) \n\n2,381 &#160; Cash paid to retire Former Caesars debt 2,356 &#160; Other consideration paid 48 &#160; Total purchase consideration $ 10,875 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) Former Caesars common stock was converted into the right to receive approximately 0.3085 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock, with a value equal to approximately $ 12.41 in cash (based on the volume weighted average price per share of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock for the ten trading days ending on July 16, 2020). \n\nFinal Purchase Price Allocation \n\nThe fair values are based on management&#8217;s analysis including work performed by third party valuation specialists, which were finalized over the one-year measurement period. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Former Caesars, with the excess recorded as goodwill as of December 31, 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Fair Value Current and other assets $ 3,540 &#160; Property and equipment 13,096 &#160; Goodwill 9,064 &#160; Intangible assets (a) \n\n3,394 &#160; Other noncurrent assets 710 &#160; Total assets $ 29,804 &#160; Current liabilities $ 1,771 &#160; Financing obligation 8,149 &#160; Long-term debt 6,591 &#160; Noncurrent liabilities 2,400 &#160; Total liabilities 18,911 &#160; Noncontrolling interests 18 &#160; Net assets acquired $ 10,875 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) Intangible assets consist of gaming rights valued at $ 396 million, trade names valued at $ 2.1 billion, the Caesars Rewards programs valued at $ 523 million and customer relationships valued at $ 425 million. \n\nThe fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Valuation methodologies under both a market and income approach used for the identifiable net assets acquired in the Former Caesars acquisition make use of Level 3 inputs, such as expected cash flows and projected financial results. The market approach indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets. \n\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the Former Caesars acquisition date. Assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, based on the agreements reached as of the acquisition date, or an income approach. \n\nCertain financial assets acquired were determined to have experienced more than insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination. A reconciliation of the difference between the purchase price of financial assets, including acquired markers, and the face value of the assets is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Purchase price of financial assets $ 95 &#160; \n\nAllowance for credit losses at the acquisition date based on the acquirer&#8217;s assessment \n\n89 &#160; Discount attributable to other factors 2 &#160; Face value of financial assets $ 186 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nThe fair value of land was determined using the sales comparable approach. The market data is then adjusted for any significant differences, to the extent known, between the identified comparable sites and the site being valued. The value of building and site improvements was estimated via the income approach. Other personal property assets such as furniture, gaming and computer equipment, fixtures, computer software, and restaurant equipment were valued using the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset. The cost approach is an estimation of fair value developed by computing the current cost of replacing a property and subtracting any depreciation resulting from one or more of the following factors: physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and/or economic obsolescence. \n\nNon-amortizing intangible assets acquired primarily include trademarks, Caesars Rewards and gaming rights. The fair value for these intangible assets was determined using either the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach. \n\nTrademarks and Caesars Rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks or loyalty program, the Company would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in return for the right to use their name or program. By virtue of this asset, the Company avoids any such payments and records the related intangible value of the Company&#8217;s ownership of the brand name or program. The acquired trademarks, including Caesars Rewards, are indefinite lived intangible assets. \n\nCustomer relationships are valued using an income approach, comparing the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced. We estimated the useful life of these customer relationships to be approximately seven years from the Merger date. \n\nGaming rights include our gaming licenses in various jurisdictions and may have indefinite lives or an estimated useful life. The fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings or replacement cost methodology, based on whether the license resides in gaming jurisdictions where competition is limited to a specified number of licensed gaming operators. The excess earnings methodology is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The replacement cost of the gaming license was used as an indicator of fair value. The acquired gaming rights have indefinite lives, with the exception of one jurisdiction in which we estimated the useful life of the license to be approximately 34 years from the Merger date. \n\nGoodwill is the result of expected synergies from the operations of the combined company and the assembled workforce of Former Caesars. The final assignment of goodwill to reporting units has not been completed. The goodwill acquired will not generate amortization deductions for income tax purposes. \n\nThe fair value of long-term debt has been calculated based on market quotes. The fair value of the financing obligations was calculated as the net present value of both the fixed base rent payments and the forecasted variable payments plus the expected residual value of the land and building returned at the end of the expected usage period. \n\nThe Company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $ 30 million and $ 160 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, in connection with the Merger. Transaction costs were associated with legal, IT costs, internal labor and professional services and were recorded in Transaction and other costs in our Statements of Operations. \n\nFor the period of July 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the properties of Former Caesars generated net revenues of $ 2.1 billion, excluding discontinued operations, and a net loss of $ 1.2 billion. \n\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information \n\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the acquisition of Former Caesars as if it had occurred on January 1, 2019. The pro forma amounts include the historical operating results of the Company and Former Caesars prior to the acquisition, with adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition. The pro forma results include adjustments and consequential tax effects to reflect incremental depreciation and amortization expense to be incurred based on preliminary fair values of the identifiable property and equipment and intangible assets acquired, the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition and the adjustments to exclude acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 as if incurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations of the combined company were, nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2020 Net revenues $ 5,926 &#160; Net loss ( 2,738 ) Net loss attributable to Caesars ( 2,670 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nNote 4. Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale \n\nThe Company periodically divests assets to raise capital or, in previous cases, to comply with conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by antitrust, gaming and other regulatory entities.

The operations of these properties, until their respective date of divestiture, have been presented within discontinued operations. In addition, at the time that the William Hill Acquisition was consummated, the Company&#8217;s intent was to divest William Hill International. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these reporting units were classified as held for sale with operations presented within discontinued operations. \n\nOn September 3, 2020, the Company and VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (&#8220;VICI&#8221;) entered into an agreement to sell the equity interests of Harrah&#8217;s Louisiana Downs to Rubico Acquisition Corp. for $ 22 million. On November 1, 2021, the sale of Harrah&#8217;s Louisiana Downs was completed and proceeds were split between the Company and VICI. The annual base rent payments under the Regional Master Lease between Caesars and VICI remained unchanged. \n\nOn December 24, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the equity interests of Caesars Southern Indiana to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (&#8220;EBCI&#8221;) for $ 250 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On September 3, 2021, the Company completed the sale of Caesars Southern Indiana, resulting in a gain of $ 12 million. In connection with this transaction, the Company&#8217;s annual base rent payments to VICI under the Regional Master Lease were reduced by $ 33 million. Additionally, the Company and EBCI entered into a 10-year brand license agreement, for the continued use of the Caesars brand and Caesars Rewards loyalty program at Caesars Southern Indiana. The agreement contains cancellation rights in exchange for a termination fee at the buyer&#8217;s discretion following the fifth anniversary of the agreement. \n\nOn July 16, 2021, the Company completed the sale of Caesars UK Group, in which the buyer assumed all liabilities associated with the Caesars UK Group, and recorded an impairment of $ 14 million within discontinued operations. \n\nThe following information presents the net revenues and net income (loss) for the Company&#8217;s properties that are part of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 (In millions) William Hill International Net revenues $ 820 &#160; Net loss ( 448 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2021 (In millions) Harrah&#8217;s Louisiana Downs Caesars UK Group Caesars Southern Indiana William Hill International Net revenues $ 48 &#160; $ 30 &#160; $ 155 &#160; $ 1,221 &#160; Net income (loss) 10 &#160; ( 30 ) 27 &#160; ( 18 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nAs of December 31, 2021, assets and liabilities held for sale of $ 3.8 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively, related to William Hill International and included $ 617 million of debt related to a Bridge Credit Agreement, which was repaid upon the sale of William Hill International on July 1, 2022. In addition, $ 850 million of debt was held for sale related to two trust deeds assumed in the William Hill Acquisition. One trust deed related to &#163; 350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750 % Senior Notes due 2026, and the other trust deed related to &#163; 350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875 % Senior Notes due 2023. The Bridge Credit Agreement was repaid and the two trust deeds were divested with the completion of the sale of William Hill International on July 1, 2022 and the Company is no longer subject to the related covenants or guarantees. \n\nNote 5. Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates \n\nNeoGames \n\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included an investment in NeoGames S.A. (&#8220;NeoGames&#8221;), a global leader of iLottery solutions and services to national and state-regulated lotteries, and other investments. On September 16, 2021, the Company sold a portion of its shares of NeoGames common stock for $ 136 million which decreased its ownership interest from 24.5 % to approximately 8.4 %. Additionally, on March 14, 2022 the Company sold its remaining 2 million shares at fair value for $ 26 million. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded losses related to the investment in NeoGames of $ 34 million and $ 54 million, respectively, which is included within Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations. \n\nPompano Joint Venture \n\nIn April 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies (&#8220;Cordish&#8221;) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at the Company&#8217;s Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with the Company&#8217;s input and will submit it for the Company&#8217;s review and approval. In June 2021, the joint venture issued a capital call and we contributed $ 3 million, for a total of $ 4 million in cash contributions since inception of the joint venture. On February 12, 2021, the Company contributed 186 acres to the joint venture with a fair value of $ 61 million. Total contributions of approximately 206 acres of land have been made with a fair value of approximately $ 69 million, and the Company has no further obligation to contribute additional real estate or cash. \n\nWhile the Company holds a 50 % variable interest in the joint venture, it is not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. The Company participates evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction and other costs on the Statements of Operations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company&#8217;s investment in the joint venture is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets. \n\nNote 6. Property and Equipment \n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, except for assets acquired in our business combinations which were adjusted for fair value under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805. Internal use software costs are capitalized during the application development stage. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset as noted in the table below, or the term of the lease, whichever is less. Gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in operating income. Useful lives of each asset class are generally as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Buildings and improvements 3 to 40 years \n\nLand improvements 12 to 40 years \n\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 15 years \n\nRiverboats 30 years \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nA portion of our property and equipment is subject to various operating leases for which we are the lessor. Leased property includes our hotel rooms, convention space and retail space through various short-term and long-term operating leases. See Note 10 for further discussion of our leases. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nThe Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge may be recorded for any difference between fair value and the carrying value. All recognized impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses, unless the assets represent a discontinued operation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a tangible asset impairment of $ 4 million related to the sale of a corporate airplane. See Note 4 for further discussion of impairment on assets held for sale. \n\n##TABLE_START Property and Equipment, Net December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Land $ 2,092 &#160; $ 2,125 &#160; Buildings, riverboats, and leasehold and land improvements 13,094 &#160; 12,433 &#160; Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 2,054 &#160; 1,650 &#160; Construction in progress 351 &#160; 395 &#160; Total property and equipment 17,591 &#160; 16,603 &#160; Less: accumulated depreciation ( 2,993 ) ( 2,002 ) Total property and equipment, net $ 14,598 &#160; $ 14,601 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Depreciation Expense Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Depreciation expense $ 1,018 &#160; $ 987 &#160; $ 527 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease. \n\nNote 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net \n\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company determines the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is recorded as goodwill. \n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests as of October 1 of each fiscal year. The Company performs this assessment more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We utilized an income approach using a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our goodwill. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;), valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general, and expected sales proceeds. The Company also evaluates the aggregate fair value of all of its reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in the industry. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, Caesars Rewards and expenditures associated with obtaining racing and gaming licenses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are subject to an annual impairment test. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess amount. \n\nTrademarks and Caesars Rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks or loyalty program, the Company would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in return for the right to use their name or program. By virtue of this asset, the Company avoids any such payments and records the related intangible value of the Company&#8217;s ownership of the brand name or program. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nGaming rights represent intangible assets acquired from the purchase of a gaming entity located in a gaming jurisdiction where competition is limited, such as when only a limited number of gaming operators are allowed to operate in the jurisdiction. These gaming license rights are not subject to amortization as the Company has determined that they have indefinite useful lives. For gaming jurisdictions with high barriers of renewal of the gaming rights, such as material costs of renewal, the gaming rights are deemed to have a finite useful life and are amortized over the expected useful life. We used the Excess Earnings Method and a Cost Approach for estimating fair value for these gaming rights. \n\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and customer relationships acquired in business combinations. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company evaluates for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. When indicators are noted, the Company then compares estimated future cash flows, undiscounted, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is recorded. Impairment charges are presented on the statements of operations. \n\nAs a result of the finalized and approved capital and operating plans and the completion of the annual impairment testing, the Company recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment primarily due to an increase in the related discount rates, which represents the higher required cost of capital as a result of the macroeconomic environment and projected outlook. The Company identified one property, where the estimated fair value of the associated gaming rights was less than the carrying value and recorded an impairment of $ 30 million. In addition, the Company identified two reporting units with which the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit was below the carrying value and we recorded a total impairment of $ 78 million to goodwill. \n\nIn December 2021, the Company approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties. The Company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $ 102 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The adjusted carrying values of these trademarks were amortized over their respective useful lives. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $ 100 million and $ 16 million, respectively, due to declines in recent performance and the expected impact on future cash flows as a result of COVID-19. \n\nWhen assets are deemed to be held for sale, any associated intangible assets, including goodwill, are reclassified to Assets held for sale on our Balance Sheets (see Note 4). \n\n##TABLE_START Changes in Carrying Value of Goodwill by Segment (In millions) Las Vegas Regional Caesars Digital Managed and Branded CEI Total Gross Goodwill: Balance as of January 1, 2021 \n\n$ 6,873 &#160; $ 3,045 &#160; $ 50 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9,968 &#160; Acquired (a) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 63 &#160; 1,148 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,211 &#160; Other 16 &#160; ( 15 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2021 \n\n6,889 &#160; 3,093 &#160; 1,198 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,180 &#160; Accumulated Impairment: Balance as of January 1, 2021 \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 104 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 104 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 104 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 104 ) \n\nNet carrying value, as of December 31, 2021 \n\n$ 6,889 &#160; $ 2,989 &#160; $ 1,198 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 11,076 &#160; Gross Goodwill: Balance as of January 1, 2022 \n\n$ 6,889 &#160; $ 3,093 &#160; $ 1,198 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 11,180 &#160; Other (a) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2022 \n\n6,889 &#160; 3,093 &#160; 1,204 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,186 &#160; Accumulated Impairment: Balance as of January 1, 2022 \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 104 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 104 ) Impairment &#8212; &#160; ( 78 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 78 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 182 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 182 ) \n\nNet carrying value, as of December 31, 2022 (b) \n\n$ 6,889 &#160; $ 2,911 &#160; $ 1,204 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 11,004 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) See Note 3 for further detail.

Restricted cash includes cash equivalents held in short-term certificate of deposit accounts or money market type funds. Restricted cash that is not subject to remeasurement on a recurring basis is not included in the table above. \n\nMarketable Securities \n\nMarketable securities consist primarily of trading securities held by the Company&#8217;s captive insurance subsidiary, deferred compensation plans and investments acquired in the William Hill Acquisition. The estimated fair values of the Company&#8217;s marketable securities are determined on an individual asset basis based upon quoted prices of identical assets available in active markets (Level 1), quoted prices of identical assets in inactive markets, or quoted prices for similar assets in active and inactive markets (Level 2), and represent the amounts the Company would expect to receive if the Company sold these marketable securities. \n\nThe Company held common shares of Flutter Entertainment PLC, which is a publicly traded company with a readily determinable share price. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold a portion of these shares for $ 24 million and recorded a gain of $ 14 million. On July 7, 2021, the Company sold the remaining shares for $ 9 million and recorded a loss of $ 1 million on the sale date. Gains and losses have been included in Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations. \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nThe Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. \n\nForward contracts \n\nT he Company entered into several foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates between USD and GBP. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $ 73 million and $ 23 million, respectively , related to forward contracts, which was recorded in the Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations. All forward contracts have been settled as of July 1, 2022. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nInterest Rate Swap Derivatives \n\nWe assumed Former Caesars&#8217; interest rate swaps to manage the mix of assumed debt between fixed and variable rate instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had four interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on $ 1.3 billion of variable rate debt related to the CRC Credit Agreement. The interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements was accrued as interest rates changed and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense at settlement. The term of the interest rate swaps ended on December 31, 2022. \n\nValuation Methodology \n\nThe estimated fair values of our interest rate swap derivative instruments were derived from market prices obtained from dealer quotes for similar, but not identical, assets or liabilities. Such quotes represented the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts. The interest rate swap derivative instruments were included in either Other assets, net or Other long-term liabilities on our Balance Sheets. Our derivatives were recorded at their fair values, adjusted for the credit rating of the counterparty if the derivative was an asset, or adjusted for the credit rating of the Company if the derivative was a liability. None of our derivative instruments were offset and all were classified as Level 2. \n\nFinancial Statement Effect \n\nThe effect of interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments on the Balance Sheets for amounts transferred into Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) before tax was a gain of $ 28 million and $ 62 million, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. AOCI reclassified to Interest expense on the Statements of Operations was $ 12 million and $ 59 million, for years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the interest rate swaps derivative liability was $ 28 million.

Exit costs are related to the unbundling of electric service provided by NV Energy which we assumed from the Merger. \n\nNote 10. Leases \n\nThe Company has operating and finance leases for various real estate and equipment. Certain of the Company&#8217;s lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of sales over specified contractual amounts, rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation and rental payments based on usage. The Company&#8217;s leases include options to extend the lease term one month to 75 years. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain any material restrictive covenants, other than those described below. \n\nLessee Arrangements \n\nOperating Leases \n\nWe lease real estate and equipment used in our operations from third parties. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining term of our operating leases ranged from 1 to 69 years with various extension options available, if we elect to exercise them. However, our remaining terms only include extension options that we have determined are reasonably certain as of December 31, 2022. In addition to minimum rental commitments, certain of our operating leases provide for contingent rentals based on a percentage of revenues in excess of specified amounts. We do not include costs associated with our non-lease components in our lease costs disclosed in the table below. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we obtained $ 43 million and $ 13 million, respectively, of right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets in exchange for new lease liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we disposed of $ 12 million of ROU assets and lease liabilities. \n\nLeases recorded on the balance sheet consist of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (In millions) Classification on the Balance Sheet 2022 2021 Assets: Operating lease ROU assets (a) \n\nOther assets, net $ 639 &#160; $ 662 &#160; Liabilities: Current operating lease liabilities (a) \n\nAccrued other liabilities 50 &#160; 49 &#160; Non-current operating lease liabilities (a) \n\nOther long-term liabilities 710 &#160; 726 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(a) As noted above, we have elected the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption and do not establish ROU assets or liabilities for operating leases with terms of 12 months or less. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\n##TABLE_START Lease Terms and Discount Rate December 31, 2022 2021 Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term (in years) 32.2 28.8 Weighted Average Discount Rate 8.3 &#160; % 8.1 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START Components of Lease Expense Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease expense $ 132 &#160; $ 128 &#160; $ 53 &#160; Short-term and variable lease expense 138 &#160; 104 &#160; 50 &#160; Total operating lease costs $ 270 &#160; $ 232 &#160; $ 103 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Cash payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 110 &#160; $ 96 &#160; 49 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Maturities of Lease Liabilities (In millions) Operating Leases 2023 $ 109 &#160; 2024 75 &#160; 2025 73 &#160; 2026 71 &#160; 2027 72 &#160; Thereafter 1,975 &#160; Total future minimum lease payments 2,375 &#160; Less: present value factor ( 1,615 ) Total lease liability $ 760 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nFinance Leases \n\nWe have finance leases for certain equipment and real estate. As of December 31, 2022, our finance leases had remaining lease terms of up to approximately 36 years, some of which include options to extend the lease terms in one month increments. Our finance lease ROU assets and liabilities were $ 73 million and $ 78 million as of December 31, 2022, respectively, and $ 40 million and $ 43 million as of December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nFinancing Obligations \n\nVICI Leases &#38; Golf Course Use Agreement \n\nThe fair value of the real estate assets and the related failed sale-leaseback financing obligations were estimated based on the present value of the estimated future lease payments over the lease term of 15 years, plus renewal options, using an imputed discount rate of approximately 11.01 %. \n\nCEI leases certain real property assets from VICI under the following agreements: (i) for a portfolio of properties located throughout the United States (the &#8220;Regional Lease&#8221;), (ii) for Caesars Palace Las Vegas and Harrah&#8217;s Las Vegas (the &#8220;Las Vegas Lease&#8221;), and (iii) for Harrah&#8217;s Joliet Hotel &#38; Casino (the &#8220;Joliet Lease&#8221;), (collectively, &#8220;VICI Leases&#8221;). The lease agreements, inclusive of all amendments, include (i) a 15-year initial term with four five-year renewal options, (ii) annual fixed rent payments of $ 1.1 billion, subject to annual escalation provisions based on the Consumer Price Index (&#8220;CPI&#8221;) and a 2 % floor which commenced in lease year two of the initial terms and (iii) a variable element based on net revenues of the underlying leased properties, commencing in lease year eight of the initial term. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nThe Regional Lease includes a put-call option whereby the Company may require VICI to purchase and lease back (as lessor) or whereby VICI may require the Company to sell to VICI and lease back (as lessee) the real estate components of the gaming and racetrack facilities of Harrah&#8217;s Hoosier Park Racing &#38; Casino and Indiana Grand (&#8220;Centaur properties&#8221;). Election to exercise the option by either party must be made during the election period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2024. Upon either party exercising their option, the Centaur properties would be sold at a price in accordance with the agreement and leased back to CEI in accordance to the pre-existing terms of the Regional Lease. \n\nThe Golf Course Use Agreement between the Company and VICI, encompassing four golf courses in three states, has a 35-year term (inclusive of all renewal periods), whereby the Company agrees to pay (i) an annual membership fee of $ 11 million, subject to annual escalation provisions based on the CPI and a 2 % floor (ii) annual use fees of $ 3 million, including escalation provisions based on the CPI and a 2 % floor commencing on the second lease year through and including the final lease year and (iii) certain per-round fees, as set forth in the agreement. Furthermore, the term of the Golf Course Use Agreement was extended such that there will be 15 years remaining until the expiration of the initial term. \n\nGLPI Leases \n\nThe fair value of the real estate assets and the related failed sale-leaseback financing obligations were estimated based on the present value of the estimated future lease payments over the lease term of 35 years, including renewal options, using an imputed discount rate of approximately 9.75 %. The value of the failed sale-leaseback financing obligations is dependent upon assumptions regarding the amount of the lease payments and the estimated discount rate of the lease payments required by a market participant. \n\nCEI leases certain real property assets from GLPI under the Master Lease (as amended, the &#8220;GLPI Master Lease&#8221;). The GLPI Master Lease, encompassing a portfolio of properties within the United States, provides for the lease of land, buildings, structures and other improvements on the land, easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements relating to the operation of the leased properties. The GLPI Master Lease, inclusive of all amendments, provides for (i) an initial term of 20 years (through September 2038), with four five-year renewals at the Company&#8217;s option, (ii) annual land and building base rent of $ 24 million and $ 63 million, respectively, (iii) escalating provisions of building base rent equal to 101.25 % of the rent for the preceding year for lease years five and six , 101.75 % for lease years seven and eight and 102 % for each lease year thereafter and (iv) relief from the operating, capital expenditure and financial covenants in the event of involuntary closures. The GLPI Master Lease does not provide the Company with an option to purchase the leased property or the ability to terminate its obligations under the GLPI Master Lease prior to its expiration without GLPI&#8217;s consent. \n\nThe Lumi&#232;re Lease was entered into by the Company and GLPI, whereby the Company sold the real estate underlying Horseshoe St. Louis, formerly known as Lumi&#232;re, to GLPI and leased back the property under a long-term financing obligation. The Lumi&#232;re Lease, inclusive of all amendments, provides for (i) an initial term commencing on September 29, 2020 and ending on October 31, 2033, (ii) four five-year renewal options, (iii) annual rent payments of $ 23 million, (iv) escalation provisions commencing in lease year two equal to 101.25 % of the rent for the preceding year for lease years two through five , 101.75 % for lease years six and seven and 102 % for each lease year thereafter, (v) maintaining a minimum of 1.20 :1 adjusted revenue to rent ratio and (vi) certain relief under the financial covenant in the event of involuntary closures. \n\nThe Company continues to reflect the real estate assets related to the failed sale-lease back transactions on the Balance Sheets in Property and equipment, net as if the Company was the legal owner, and continues to recognize depreciation expense over their estimated useful lives. \n\nThe future minimum payments related to the GLPI Leases, including the Lumi&#232;re Lease, and VICI Leases financing obligation, as amended, at December 31, 2022 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) GLPI Leases VICI Leases 2023 $ 111 &#160; $ 1,166 &#160; 2024 112 &#160; 1,188 &#160; 2025 113 &#160; 1,204 &#160; 2026 115 &#160; 1,221 &#160; 2027 117 &#160; 1,242 &#160; Thereafter 4,487 &#160; 44,616 &#160; Total future payments 5,055 &#160; 50,637 &#160; Less: Amounts representing interest ( 4,050 ) ( 40,236 ) Plus: Residual values 240 &#160; 893 &#160; Financing obligation $ 1,245 &#160; $ 11,294 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nCash payments made relating to our long-term financing obligations during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START GLPI Leases (a) \n\nVICI Leases (a) \n\nDecember 31, December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for principal $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 49 &#160; Cash paid for interest 110 &#160; 109 &#160; 93 &#160; 1,095 &#160; 983 &#160; 472 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) For the initial periods of the VICI and GLPI Leases, cash payments are less than the interest expense recognized, which causes the failed-sale leaseback obligation to increase during the initial years of the lease term. \n\nLease Covenants \n\nThe GLPI Leases and VICI Leases contain certain covenants requiring minimum capital expenditures based on a percentage of net revenues along with maintaining certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2022. \n\nLessor Arrangements \n\nLodging Arrangements \n\nLodging arrangements are considered short-term and generally consist of lease and nonlease components. The lease component is the predominant component of the arrangement and consists of the fees charged for lodging. The nonlease components primarily consist of resort fees and other miscellaneous items. As the timing and pattern of transfer of both the lease and nonlease components are over the course of the lease term, we have elected to combine the revenue generated from lease and nonlease components into a single lease component based on the predominant component in the arrangement. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $ 2.0 billion, $ 1.6 billion and $ 450 million, respectively, in lease revenue related to lodging arrangements, which is included in Hotel revenues in the Statements of Operations. \n\nConventions \n\nConvention arrangements are considered short-term and generally consist of lease and nonlease components. The lease component is the predominant component of the arrangement and consists of fees charged for the use of meeting space. The nonlease components primarily consist of food and beverage and audio/visual services. Revenue from conventions is included in Other revenue in the Statement of Operations, and during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $ 34 million, $ 7 million and $ 3 million, respectively, in lease revenue related to conventions. \n\nReal Estate Operating Leases \n\nWe enter into long-term real estate leasing arrangements with third-party lessees at our properties. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining terms of these operating leases ranged from 1 to 83 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years . In addition to minimum rental commitments, certain of our operating leases provide for contingent payments including contingent rentals based on a percentage of revenues in excess of specified amounts and reimbursements for common area maintenance and utilities charges. As the timing and pattern of transfer of both the lease and nonlease components are over the course of the lease term, we have elected to combine the revenue generated from lease and nonlease components into a single lease component based on the predominant component in the arrangement. In addition, to maintain the value of our leased assets, certain leases include specific maintenance requirements of the lessees or maintenance is performed by the Company on behalf of the lessees. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $ 168 million, $ 149 million and $ 41 million, respectively, of real estate lease revenue, which is included in Other revenue in the Statement of Operations. Real estate lease revenue includes $ 64 million, $ 45 million and $ 13 million, respectively, of variable rental income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMaturities of Lease Receivables \n\n(In millions) Operating Leases 2023 $ 73 &#160; 2024 66 &#160; 2025 60 &#160; 2026 58 &#160; 2027 52 &#160; Thereafter 703 &#160; Total $ 1,012 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNote 11. Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies \n\nLitigation \n\nGeneral \n\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings, which have arisen in the normal course of our business. Such proceedings can be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings will not materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Estimated losses are accrued for these proceedings when the loss is probable and can be estimated. While we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to mitigate the risks of such proceedings, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters. The current liability for the estimated losses associated with these proceedings is not material to our consolidated financial condition and those estimated losses are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations. \n\nCOVID-19 Insurance Claims \n\nThe COVID-19 public health emergency had a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s business and employees, as well as the communities where the Company operates and serves. The Company purchased broad property insurance coverage to protect against &#8220;all risk of physical loss or damage&#8221; and resulting business interruption, unless specifically excluded by policies. The Company submitted claims for losses incurred as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency which exceed $ 2 billion. The insurance carriers under the Company&#8217;s insurance policies have asserted that the policies do not cover losses incurred by the Company as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency and have refused to make payments under the applicable policies. Therefore, on March 19, 2021, the Company filed a lawsuit against its insurance carriers in the state court in Clark County, Nevada. On June 8, 2021, the Company filed an amended complaint. Litigation is proceeding and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the litigation. \n\nContractual Commitments \n\nCapital Commitments \n\nHarrah&#8217;s New Orleans \n\nIn April 2020, the Company and the State of Louisiana, by and through the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, entered into an Amended and Restated Casino Operating Contract. Additionally, the Company, New Orleans Building Corporation and the City entered into a Second Amended and Restated Lease Agreement. Based on these amendments related to Harrah&#8217;s New Orleans, the Company is required to make a capital investment of $ 325 million on or around Harrah&#8217;s New Orleans by July 15, 2024. The capital investment will include a renovation and full interior and exterior redesign, updated casino floor, new culinary experiences and a new 340 room hotel tower as part of the project to rebrand the property to Caesars New Orleans. As of December 31, 2022, total capital expenditures on the project have been $ 112 million. \n\nAtlantic City \n\nAs required by the New Jersey Gaming Control Board in connection with its approval of the Merger, we funded $ 400 million in escrow to provide funds for a three year capital expenditure plan in the state of New Jersey. This amount is currently included in restricted cash in Other assets, net. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our restricted cash balance in the escrow account was $ 118 million and $ 297 million, respectively, for future capital expenditures in New Jersey. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nSports Sponsorship/Partnership Obligations \n\nWe have agreements with certain professional sports leagues and teams, sporting event facilities and media companies for tickets, suites, and advertising, marketing, promotional and sponsorship opportunities including communication with partner customer databases. Additionally, a selection of such partnerships provide Caesars with exclusivity to access the aforementioned rights within the casino and/or sports betting category. In connection with the launch of the Caesars Sportsbook app, we entered into a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, former athletes and other media personalities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , obligations related to these agreements were $ 898 million and $ 997 million, respectively, which include obligations assumed in the William Hill Acquisition, with contracts extending through 2040. These obligations include leasing of event suites that are generally considered short term leases for which we do not record a right of use asset or lease liability. We recognize expenses in the period services are received in accordance with the various agreements. In addition, assets or liabilities may be recorded related to the timing of payments as required by the respective agreement. \n\nSelf-Insurance \n\nWe are self-insured for workers compensation and other risk insurance, as well as health insurance and general liability. Our total estimated self-insurance liability was $ 203 million and $ 221 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is included in Accrued other liabilities on our Balance Sheets. \n\nThe assumptions utilized by our actuaries are subject to significant uncertainty and if outcomes differ from these assumptions or events develop or progress in a negative manner, the Company could experience a material adverse effect and additional liabilities may be recorded in the future. \n\nContingencies \n\nWeather Disruption - Lake Charles \n\nOn August 27, 2020 , Hurricane Laura made landfall on Lake Charles as a Category 4 storm severely damaging the Isle of Capri Casino Lake Charles (&#8220;Lake Charles&#8221;). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reached a final settlement agreement with the insurance carriers for a total amount of $ 128 million, before our insurance deductible of $ 25 million. The Company has received a total of $ 103 million related to damaged fixed assets, remediation costs and business interruption. \n\nThe Company recorded gains of $ 38 million and $ 21 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, which are included in Transaction and other costs, net in our Statements of Operations, as proceeds received for the cost to replace damaged property were in excess of respective carrying value of the assets.

Unamortized discounts are written off and included in our gain or loss calculations to the extent we extinguish debt prior to the original maturity or payment dates. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nNet amortization of the debt issuance costs and the discount and/or premium associated with the Company&#8217;s indebtedness totaled $ 139 million, $ 177 million and $ 80 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization of debt issuance costs is computed using the effective interest method and is included in interest expense. \n\nFair Value \n\nThe fair value of debt has been calculated primarily based on the borrowing rates available as of December 31, 2022 and based on market quotes of our publicly traded debt. We classify the fair value of debt within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nTerms of Outstanding Debt \n\nBaltimore Term Loan and Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility \n\nAs a result of the increased ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore, the Company began to consolidate the aggregate principal amount of Horseshoe Baltimore&#8217;s senior secured term loan facility (the &#8220;Baltimore Term Loan&#8221;) and amount outstanding, if any, under Horseshoe Baltimore&#8217;s senior secured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;).

Revenue Recognition \n\nAccounting Policies \n\nCasino Revenues \n\nOur casino revenues consists of gaming wagers, pari-mutuel commissions, sports betting and iGaming wagers. The Company recognizes as casino revenue the net win from these gaming activities, which is the difference between gaming wins and losses, not the total amount wagered. Progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. Gaming revenues are recognized net of free bets, free play, matched deposits, and other similar incentives to its customers. During significant promotional periods, such as entering new jurisdictions with our Caesars Sportsbook or Caesars Racebook apps, such activity could result in negative net gaming revenue. Such periods are not expected to be long in duration as our level of investment during these promotional periods is within our discretion. Pari-mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks and are recognized at the time wagers are made. Such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations.

Such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks. \n\nNon-gaming Revenues \n\nHotel, food and beverage, and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. Hotel, food and beverage services have been determined to be separate, stand-alone performance obligations and are recorded as revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer over the customer&#8217;s stay at the hotel or when the delivery is made for the food and beverage. Advance deposits for future hotel occupancy, convention space or food and beverage services contract are recorded as deferred income until revenue recognition criteria has been met. The Company also provides goods and services that may include multiple performance obligations, such as for packages, for which revenues are allocated on a pro rata basis based on each service&#8217;s stand-alone selling price. \n\nSales and other taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net revenues or operating expenses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Statement of Operations presents net revenue disaggregated by type or nature of the good or service.

Business or economic conditions or other significant events could affect the collectability of these receivables. Accounts receivable are non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. \n\nMarker play represents a meaningful portion of our overall table games volume. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. \n\nTrade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. Management believes that as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no significant concentrations of credit risk related to receivables existed. \n\nReserve for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable \n\nAn estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company&#8217;s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts, historical collection experience and reasonable forecasts which consider current economic and business conditions. As with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts. \n\n##TABLE_START Accounts Receivable, Net December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Casino $ 259 &#160; $ 168 &#160; Food and beverage and hotel 144 &#160; 100 &#160; Other 208 &#160; 204 &#160; Accounts receivable, net $ 611 &#160; $ 472 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\n##TABLE_START Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (In millions) Contracts Other (a) \n\nTotal \n\nBalance as of January 1, 2020 \n\n$ 4 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 5 &#160; Former Caesars consolidation 95 &#160; 35 &#160; 130 &#160; Provision for doubtful accounts 18 &#160; 11 &#160; 29 &#160; Write-offs less recoveries 3 &#160; ( 29 ) ( 26 ) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 \n\n120 &#160; 18 &#160; 138 &#160; Provision for doubtful accounts 16 &#160; 10 &#160; 26 &#160; Write-offs less recoveries ( 26 ) ( 8 ) ( 34 ) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 \n\n110 &#160; 20 &#160; 130 &#160; Provision for doubtful accounts 13 &#160; 12 &#160; 25 &#160; Write-offs less recoveries ( 22 ) ( 15 ) ( 37 ) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 \n\n$ 101 &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 118 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) &#8220;Other&#8221; includes allowance associated with lease receivables under ASC 842. See Note 10 for further details. \n\nContract and Contract Related Liabilities \n\nThe Company records contract or contract-related liabilities related to differences between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer,(2) Caesars Rewards player loyalty program obligations, which represent the deferred allocation of revenue relating to reward credits granted to Caesars Rewards members based on certain types of customer spend, including online and retail gaming, hotel, dining, retail shopping, and player loyalty program incentives earned, and (3) customer deposits and other deferred revenue, which primarily represents funds deposited by customers related to gaming play, advance payments received for goods and services yet to be provided (such as advance ticket sales, deposits on rooms and convention space, unpaid wagers, iGaming deposits, or future sports bets). These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within accrued other liabilities on the Company&#8217;s Balance Sheets. Liabilities expected to be recognized as revenue beyond one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited are recorded within other long-term liabilities on the Company&#8217;s Balance Sheets. \n\nOutstanding Chip Liability \n\nThe Company recognizes the impact on gaming revenues on an annual basis to reflect an estimate of the change in the value of outstanding chips that are not expected to be redeemed. This estimate is determined by measuring the difference between the total value of chips placed in service less the value of chips under our control. This measurement is performed on an annual basis utilizing a methodology in which a consistent formula is applied to estimate the percentage of chips not in our custody that are not expected to be redeemed. In addition to the formula, certain judgments are made with regard to various denominations and souvenir chips. The outstanding chip liability is included in accrued other liabilities on the Balance Sheets. \n\nCaesars Rewards Loyalty Program \n\nCaesars Rewards grants Reward Credits to Caesars Rewards Members based on various types of consumer spend, including online and retail gaming, hotel, dining, and retail shopping at Caesars-affiliated properties. Members may redeem Reward Credits for complimentary or discounted goods and services such as rooms, food and beverages, merchandise, free play, entertainment, and travel accommodations. Members are able to accumulate Reward Credits over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program. A member&#8217;s Reward Credit balance is forfeited if the member does not earn at least one Reward Credit during a continuous six-month period. \n\nBecause of the significance of the Caesars Rewards program and the ability for customers to accumulate Reward Credits based on their past play, we have determined that Reward Credits granted in conjunction with other earning activity represent a performance obligation. As a result, for transactions in which Reward Credits are earned, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to the Reward Credits that are earned based upon the relative standalone selling prices (&#8220;SSP&#8221;) of the goods and services involved. When the activity underlying the &#8220;earning&#8221; of the Reward Credits has a wide range of selling prices and is highly variable, such as in the case of gaming activities, we use the residual approach in this allocation by computing the value of the Reward Credits as described below and allocating the residual amount to the gaming activity. This allocation results in a significant portion of the transaction price being deferred and presented as a Contract liability on our accompanying Balance Sheets. Any amounts allocated to Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Reward Credits are redeemed in accordance with the specific recognition policy of the activity for which the credits are redeemed. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nOur Caesars Rewards loyalty program includes various tiers that offer different benefits, and members are able to earn credits towards tier status, which generally enables them to receive discounts similar to those provided as complimentaries described below. We have determined that any such discounts received as a result of tier status do not represent material rights, and therefore, we do not account for them as distinct performance obligations. \n\nWe have determined the SSP of a Reward Credit by computing the redemption value of credits expected to be redeemed. Because Reward Credits are not otherwise independently sold, we analyzed all Reward Credit redemption activity over the preceding calendar year and determined the redemption value based on the fair market value of the goods and services for which the Reward Credits were redeemed. We have applied the practical expedient under the portfolio approach to our Reward Credit transactions because of the similarity of gaming and other transactions and the homogeneity of Reward Credits. \n\nAs part of determining the SSP for Reward Credits, we also determined that there is generally an amount of Reward Credits that is not redeemed, which is considered &#8220;breakage.&#8221; We recognize the expected breakage proportionally with the pattern of revenue recognized related to the redemption of Reward Credits. We periodically reassess our customer behaviors and revise our expectations as deemed necessary on a prospective basis. \n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities: \n\n##TABLE_START Outstanding Chip Liability Caesars Rewards Customer Deposits and Other Deferred Revenue (In millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Balance at January 1 $ 48 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 91 &#160; $ 94 &#160; $ 560 &#160; $ 310 &#160; Balance at December 31 45 &#160; 48 &#160; 87 &#160; 91 &#160; 693 &#160; 560 &#160; Increase (decrease) $ ( 3 ) $ 14 &#160; $ ( 4 ) $ ( 3 ) $ 133 &#160; $ 250 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe table above excludes liabilities related to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2021 (see Note 4). Customer deposits and other deferred revenues have increased primarily due to our expansion in the Caesars Digital segment with the legalization of retail and online sports betting in new states. \n\nComplimentaries \n\nThe Company offers discretionary coupons and other discretionary complimentaries to customers outside of the loyalty program such as matching deposits, free bets and free play. Such complimentaries are provided in conjunction with other revenue&#8209;earning activities and are generally provided to encourage additional customer spending on those activities. Accordingly, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price received from such customers to the complimentary goods and services. The Company performs this allocation based on the SSP of the underlying goods and services, which is determined based upon the weighted-average cash sales prices received for similar services at similar points during the year. The retail value of complimentary food, beverage, hotel rooms and other services provided to customers is recognized as a reduction of revenues for the department which issued the complimentary and revenue for the department redeemed. Complimentaries provided by third parties at the discretion and under the control of the Company is recorded as an expense when incurred. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenues included complimentaries and loyalty point redemptions totaling $ 1.2 billion, $ 1.0 billion and $ 406 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nNote 14. Earnings per Share \n\nBasic earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to basic EPS except that the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of stock options and the assumed vesting of restricted share units, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock options were exercised, that outstanding restricted share units were released and that the proceeds from such activities were used to acquire shares of common stock at the average market price during the reporting period. \n\nFor a period in which the Company generated a net loss from continuing operations, the weighted average shares outstanding - basic was used in calculating diluted loss per share because using diluted shares would have been anti-dilutive to loss per share. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nThe following table illustrates the required disclosure of the reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Net loss from continuing operations attributable to Caesars, net of income taxes $ ( 513 ) $ ( 989 ) $ ( 1,737 ) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes ( 386 ) ( 30 ) ( 20 ) Net loss attributable to Caesars $ ( 899 ) $ ( 1,019 ) $ ( 1,757 ) Shares outstanding: Weighted average shares outstanding &#8211; basic 214 &#160; 211 &#160; 130 &#160; Effect of dilutive securities: Stock-based compensation awards &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Weighted average shares outstanding &#8211; diluted 214 &#160; 211 &#160; 130 &#160; Basic loss per share from continuing operations $ ( 2.39 ) $ ( 4.69 ) $ ( 13.35 ) Basic loss per share from discontinued operations ( 1.80 ) ( 0.14 ) ( 0.15 ) Net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders &#8211; basic: $ ( 4.19 ) $ ( 4.83 ) $ ( 13.50 ) Diluted loss per share from continuing operations $ ( 2.39 ) $ ( 4.69 ) $ ( 13.35 ) Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations ( 1.80 ) ( 0.14 ) ( 0.15 ) Net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders &#8211; diluted: $ ( 4.19 ) $ ( 4.83 ) $ ( 13.50 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Weighted-Average Number of Anti-Dilutive Shares Excluded from Calculation of EPS Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Stock-based compensation awards 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 9 &#160; 5% Convertible notes &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Total anti-dilutive common stock 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 13 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNote 15. Stock-Based Compensation and Stockholders&#8217; Equity \n\nStock-Based Awards \n\nThe Company maintains long-term incentive plans which allow for granting stock-based compensation awards for directors, employees, officers, and consultants or advisers who render services to the Company or its subsidiaries, based on Company Common Stock, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;), performance stock units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;), market-based performance stock units (&#8220;MSUs&#8221;), stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalents. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. \n\nPerformance Incentive Plans \n\nIn 2015, the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;) adopted, and the Company&#8217;s stockholders approved, the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (&#8220;2015 Plan&#8221;). In 2019, the Company&#8217;s Board approved, and the Company&#8217;s stockholders approved, the amended and restated 2015 Plan. The amendment to the 2015 Plan allows for 3 million shares available for grant, plus the number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan on the date the Company&#8217;s stockholders approved the amendment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 5 million shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan. \n\nEquity awards granted to employees and executive officers generally vest within one to three years from the grant date either ratably on each anniversary, or entirely at the end of the service period. Awards may also contain performance conditions in addition to time based vesting conditions. Performance awards relate to the achievement of defined levels of performance and will vest and become payable at the end of the vesting period. Performance awards may contain targeted performance levels, which may ultimately vest within a range of 0 % to 200 % of the target award, based on defined operating metrics or market performance as compared to a peer group. RSUs granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately and are issued on the vesting date, or may be deferred. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nTotal stock-based compensation expense in the accompanying Statements of Operations was $ 101 million, $ 82 million and $ 79 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are included in corporate expenses and, in the case of certain property positions, general and administrative expenses in the Company&#8217;s Statements of Operations. \n\nRestricted Stock Unit Activity \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, as part of the annual incentive program, the Company granted RSUs to employees of the Company with an aggregate fair value of $ 56 million. Each RSU represents the right to receive payment in respect of one share of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock. \n\nA summary of the RSUs activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented in the following table: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (a) \n\nUnvested outstanding as of December 31, 2021 \n\n2,090,607 &#160; $ 61.47 &#160; Granted (b) \n\n773,778 &#160; 70.58 &#160; Vested ( 907,764 ) 55.88 &#160; Forfeited ( 93,140 ) 67.12 &#160; \n\nUnvested outstanding as of December 31, 2022 \n\n1,863,481 &#160; 66.87 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) Represents the weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs, which is the share price of our common stock on the grant date. \n\n(b) Included are 23,956 RSUs granted to non-employee members of the Board during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nPerformance Stock Unit Activity \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted approximately 80 thousand PSUs that are scheduled to vest over a period of one to three years from the grant date. On the vesting date, recipients will receive between 0 % and 200 % of the target number of PSUs granted, in the form of Company Common Stock, based on the achievement of specified performance conditions. The fair value of the PSUs is based on the market price of our common stock when a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the awards between the Company and recipient is achieved. The awards are remeasured each period until such an understanding is reached. The aggregate value of PSUs granted during the year was $ 3 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\nA summary of the PSUs activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented in the following table: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (a) \n\nUnvested outstanding as of December 31, 2021 \n\n417,069 &#160; $ 62.20 &#160; Granted 80,420 &#160; 41.60 &#160; Performance Adjustment 80,030 &#160; Vested ( 191,279 ) 45.39 &#160; Forfeited ( 3,083 ) 53.60 &#160; \n\nUnvested outstanding as of December 31, 2022 \n\n383,157 &#160; 51.73 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) This represents the weighted-average grant date fair value for PSUs where the grant date has been achieved or the price of our common stock as of the balance sheet date for PSUs where a grant date has not been achieved. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nMarket-Based Stock Unit Activity \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted approximately 428 thousand MSUs that are scheduled to cliff vest over a period of one to three years from the grant date. On the vesting date, recipients will receive between 0 % and 200 % of the granted MSUs in the form of Company Common Stock based on the achievement of specified market and service conditions. Based on the terms and conditions of the awards, the grant date fair value of the MSUs was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Key assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation model are the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividends and correlation coefficient. The effect of market conditions is considered in determining the grant date fair value, which is not subsequently revised based on actual performance. Included in the MSUs granted during the period is an award for the Company&#8217;s CEO in the amount of 225,000 MSUs, with a grant date fair value of $ 16 million which is eligible to be earned based on the achievement of certain stock prices over a three-year period.

The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that the Company is required to repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has acquired 223,823 shares of common stock at an aggregate value of $ 9 million and an average of $ 40.80 per share. No shares were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nNote 16. Employee Benefit Plans \n\n401(k) Plans \n\nThe Company offers several savings and retirement plans to substantially all employees who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, who meet certain eligibility requirements, namely terms of service. All existing savings and retirement plans merged into the Caesars Entertainment, Inc. 401(k) Plan. Under the 401(k) plan, the Company matches contributions equal to 50 % of the first 6 % as outlined per plan documents. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s matching contribution expense totaled $ 29 million, $ 27 million and $ 11 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nDefined-Benefit Plans \n\nScioto Downs sponsors a noncontributory defined-benefit plan covering all full-time employees meeting certain age and service requirements. On May 31, 2001, the plan was amended to freeze eligibility, accrual of years of service and benefits. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the plan assets and benefit obligation was $ 1 million. The plan assets are comprised primarily of money market and mutual funds whose values are determined based on quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not make cash contributions to the Scioto Downs pension plan during 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nIn addition, the Company also sponsors a defined-benefit plan for certain Tropicana Atlantic City employees under a Variable Annuity Pension Plan. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the plan assets was $ 21 million and benefit obligations was $ 15 million. Contributions to the plan were $ 2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and less than $ 1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nDeferred Compensation Plans \n\nCEI assumed Former Caesars deferred compensation plans, the Caesars Entertainment Corporation Executive Supplemental Savings Plan III (&#8220;ESSP III&#8221;) and the Caesars Entertainment Corporation Outside Director Deferred Compensation Plan. These plans are unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Payment obligations pursuant to the plans are unsecured general obligations of the Company and affiliates of the Company employing participants in the ESSP III. The liability as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 2 million and $ 3 million, respectively, which was recorded in Other long-term liabilities on the Balance Sheets. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, certain current and former employees of Caesars, and our subsidiaries and affiliates, have balances under: (i) the Harrah&#8217;s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan, (ii) the Harrah&#8217;s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan II, (iii) the Park Place Entertainment Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, (iv) the Harrah&#8217;s Entertainment, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, and (v) the Harrah&#8217;s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the &#8220;existing deferred compensation plans&#8221;). These plans are deferred compensation plans that allow certain employees an opportunity to save for retirement and other purposes. Each of the plans is now frozen and is no longer accepting contributions. However, participants may still earn returns on existing plan balances based upon their selected investment alternatives, which are reflected in their deferral accounts. The total liability recorded in Other long-term liabilities on the Balance Sheets for these plans was $ 33 million and $ 43 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nTrust Assets \n\nCEI is a party to a trust agreement (the &#8220;Trust Agreement&#8221;) and an escrow agreement with respect to all five of the existing deferred compensation plans (the &#8220;Escrow Agreement&#8221;), each structured as a so-called &#8220;rabbi trust&#8221; arrangement, which holds assets that may be used to satisfy obligations under the existing deferred compensation plans above. Amounts held pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Escrow Agreement were $ 60 million and $ 87 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and have been reflected within Other assets, net on the Balance Sheets. \n\nMulti-employer Pension Plans \n\nAs a result of the Merger, the Company continues to contribute to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees of Former Caesars. Prior to the Merger, no significant contributions were made to such plans. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from a single-employer plan in the following respects: \n\ni.

Significant components of the Company&#8217;s net deferred taxes at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Loss carryforwards $ 779 &#160; $ 1,006 &#160; Excess business interest expense 288 &#160; 180 &#160; Credit carryforwards 126 &#160; 114 &#160; Financing obligation 2,534 &#160; 2,517 &#160; Long-term lease obligation 160 &#160; 161 &#160; Other 272 &#160; 330 &#160; 4,159 &#160; 4,308 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Identified intangibles ( 803 ) ( 1,111 ) Foreign investment - held for sale &#8212; &#160; ( 139 ) Fixed assets ( 2,243 ) ( 2,212 ) Right-of-use assets ( 128 ) ( 131 ) Other ( 163 ) ( 138 ) ( 3,337 ) ( 3,731 ) Valuation allowance ( 1,809 ) ( 1,840 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 987 ) $ ( 1,263 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe net deferred tax liabilities above are presented in the Balance Sheets as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Deferred income taxes $ ( 987 ) $ ( 1,111 ) Assets held for sale &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; Liabilities related to assets held for sale &#8212; &#160; ( 159 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 987 ) $ ( 1,263 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nAs a result of the Merger, the Company assumed $ 767 million of additional net deferred tax liabilities, net of valuation allowances, plus $ 24 million in additional accruals for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest. As a result of the William Hill Acquisition, the Company assumed $ 381 million of additional net deferred tax liabilities net of valuation allowances, plus $ 34 million in additional accruals for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest. Of the deferred tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions recorded due to the William Hill Acquisition, $ 132 million and $ 34 million, respectively, have been presented in Liabilities related to assets held for sale. \n\nA valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income. We have provided a valuation allowance on certain federal, state, and foreign deferred tax assets that were not deemed realizable based upon estimates of future taxable income. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 1.9 billion and $ 9.2 billion, respectively and federal general business tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards of $ 129 million, which will expire on various dates as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year of Expiration Net Operating Losses Tax Credits (In millions) Federal States Federal 2023-2027 &#8212; &#160; 530 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2028-2032 914 &#160; 1,376 &#160; 39 &#160; 2033-2042 589 &#160; 5,030 &#160; 90 &#160; Do not expire 437 &#160; 2,219 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 1,940 &#160; $ 9,155 &#160; $ 129 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\nIn general, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its net operating loss carryovers, as well as certain built-in losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. The Merger in July 2020 and the William Hill Acquisition in April 2021 resulted in a change in ownership for purposes of Section 382, making its provisions applicable to the Company. However, it is unlikely that the annual limitation on tax attribute usage resulting from the acquisition will adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryovers against its future taxable income. \n\n##TABLE_START Reconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance as of beginning of year $ 157 &#160; $ 137 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Acquisition of Caesars Entertainment Corporation &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 152 &#160; Acquisition of William Hill &#8212; &#160; 32 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Sale of William Hill International ( 24 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 3 &#160; 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years 1 &#160; 5 &#160; 1 &#160; Reductions for tax positions for prior years ( 8 ) ( 8 ) &#8212; &#160; Settlements &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 4 ) Expiration of statutes ( 1 ) ( 13 ) ( 12 ) Balance as of end of year $ 128 &#160; $ 157 &#160; $ 137 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nWe classify reserves for tax uncertainties within Other long-term liabilities in our Balance Sheets, separate from any related income tax payable or Deferred income taxes. Reserve amounts relate to any potential income tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions as well as potential interest or penalties associated with those liabilities. \n\nWe accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During 2022, we decreased our accrual by $ 29 million, primarily due to the sale of William Hill International. During 2021, we increased our accrual by $ 20 million, primarily due to the William Hill Acquisition. During 2020, we increased our accrual by $ 137 million, primarily as a result of the Merger. There was no accrual for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022 and an accrual of $ 2 million as of December 31, 2021. Included in the balances of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 115 million and $ 117 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. \n\nThe Company, including its subsidiaries, files tax returns with federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated group. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to US federal or state and local tax assessments by tax authorities for years before 2019. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits liability will not materially change within the next 12 months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe that adequate provision has been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be reduced, thus having a favorable impact on earnings. \n\nNote 18. Related Parties \n\nREI \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Recreational Enterprises, Inc. (&#8220;REI&#8221;) owned approximately 4.0 % of outstanding common stock of the Company.

These related party transactions included items such as casino management fees, reimbursement of various costs incurred on behalf of Horseshoe Baltimore, and the allocation of other general corporate expenses. \n\nTransactions with NeoGames \n\nThe Company held an interest in NeoGames (see Note 5). NeoGames provides the player account management system to our wholly-owned Liberty platform. We have a dedicated team of programmers at NeoGames working on enhancements to our player account management system on our behalf, for which NeoGames is compensated under a services agreement. \n\nNote 19. Segment Information \n\nThe executive decision maker of the Company reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a &#8220;significant market&#8221; basis. Management views each of the Company&#8217;s casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. The Company&#8217;s principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments. The reportable segments are based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments with the way management assesses these results and allocates resources, which is a consolidated view that adjusts for the effect of certain transactions between these reportable segments within Caesars: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenues less certain operating expenses and is comprised of net income (loss) before (i) interest income and interest expense, net of interest capitalized, (ii) income tax (benefit) provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, and (iv) certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance at an operating property level. \n\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA is included because management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management. \n\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net loss attributable to Caesars $ ( 899 ) $ ( 1,019 ) $ ( 1,757 ) Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 11 ) 3 &#160; ( 1 ) Net loss from discontinued operations 386 &#160; 30 &#160; 20 &#160; (Benefit) provision for income taxes ( 41 ) ( 283 ) 132 &#160; \n\nOther (income) loss (a) \n\n( 46 ) 198 &#160; ( 176 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 85 &#160; 236 &#160; 197 &#160; Interest expense, net 2,265 &#160; 2,295 &#160; 1,202 &#160; Depreciation and amortization 1,205 &#160; 1,126 &#160; 583 &#160; Impairment charges 108 &#160; 102 &#160; 215 &#160; \n\nTransaction costs and other (b) \n\n90 &#160; 220 &#160; 300 &#160; Stock-based compensation expense 101 &#160; 82 &#160; 79 &#160; Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,243 &#160; $ 2,990 &#160; $ 794 &#160; Adjusted EBITDA by Segment: Las Vegas $ 1,964 &#160; $ 1,568 &#160; $ 133 &#160; Regional 1,985 &#160; 1,979 &#160; 711 &#160; Caesars Digital ( 666 ) ( 476 ) 26 &#160; Managed and Branded 84 &#160; 87 &#160; 25 &#160; Corporate and Other ( 124 ) ( 168 ) ( 101 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) Other (income) loss primarily includes the net changes in fair value of (i) investments held by the Company (ii) foreign exchange forward contracts (iii) the disputed claims liability related to Former Caesars&#8217; bankruptcy prior to the Merger, and (iv) the derivative liability related to the 5 % Convertible Notes, which were fully converted during the year ended December 31, 2021, and the change in the foreign exchange rate associated with restricted cash held in GBP associated with our acquisition of William Hill. \n\n(b) Transaction costs and other primarily includes costs related to the William Hill Acquisition, the Merger, various contract or license termination exit costs, professional services for integration activities and non-cash changes in equity method investments partially offset by gains resulting from insurance proceeds received in excess of the respective carrying value of the assets damaged at Lake Charles by Hurricane Laura. \n\n##TABLE_START Capital Expenditures, Net - By Segment Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Las Vegas $ 165 &#160; $ 85 &#160; $ 32 &#160; Regional 597 &#160; 327 &#160; 104 &#160; Caesars Digital 106 &#160; 67 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other 84 &#160; 39 &#160; 33 &#160; Total (a) \n\n$ 952 &#160; $ 518 &#160; $ 169 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(a) Includes capital expenditures associated with our discontinued operations, where applicable. \n\n##TABLE_START Total Assets - By Segment December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Las Vegas $ 23,547 &#160; $ 22,374 &#160; Regional 14,908 &#160; 14,419 &#160; Caesars Digital 1,200 &#160; 1,878 &#160; Managed and Branded (a) \n\n140 &#160; 3,527 &#160; Corporate and Other (b) \n\n( 6,268 ) ( 4,167 ) Total $ 33,527 &#160; $ 38,031 &#160; ##TABLE_END ____________________ \n\n(a) Assets held for sale associated with William Hill International were divested on July 1, 2022. \n\n(b) Includes eliminations of transactions among segments, to reconcile to the Company&#8217;s consolidated results. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nWe have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. \n\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on these evaluations, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) were effective as of December 31, 2022, at a reasonable assurance level. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP. \n\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated and assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report based upon the framework set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based on their evaluation and assessment, they concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. \n\nDeloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which report follows below. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.: \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nLas Vegas, Nevada \n\nFebruary 21, 2023 \n\n"
