      "text": " ITEM 1. BUSINESS \n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW \n\nIDEXX was incorporated in Delaware in 1983. We develop, manufacture, and distribute products and provide services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, dairy and water testing industries. We also provide human medical point-of-care and laboratory diagnostics. Our primary products and services are: \n\n&#8226; Point-of-care veterinary diagnostic products, comprised of instruments, consumables, and rapid assay test kits; \n\n&#8226; Veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services; \n\n&#8226; Practice management and diagnostic imaging systems and services used by veterinarians; \n\n&#8226; Health monitoring, biological materials testing, laboratory diagnostic instruments, and services used by the biomedical research community; \n\n&#8226; Diagnostic, health-monitoring products for livestock, poultry, and dairy; \n\n&#8226; Products that test water for certain microbiological contaminants; and \n\n&#8226; Point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers. \n\nOur Purpose is to be a great company that creates exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees, and stockholders by enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT \n\nWe operate primarily through three business segments: Companion Animal Group, Water quality products, and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy. Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products and services business with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. \n\nCompanion Animal Group (&#8220;CAG&#8221;) - Diagnostic and information management-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary industry, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions, outside reference laboratory services, and veterinary software and services. \n\nCAG Diagnostics \n\nWe provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians&#8217; diverse needs through a variety of modalities, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Regardless of modality utilized, veterinarians are provided with clinically relevant data which is integrated within our information management technologies. The result is a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner. \n\nIntegrated Diagnostic Information Management . VetConnect PLUS is a cloud-based technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients&#8217; data from all of IDEXX&#8217;s diagnostic modalities. These integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patient-specific testing results, allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend diagnostic results, enabling greater medical insight and enhanced decision-making. In addition, VetConnect PLUS provides instant mobile or browser-based access to results, which can be printed or emailed to pet owners and other veterinarians. \n\nIn-Clinic Diagnostic Solutions . Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of our IDEXX VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry, hematology, immunoassay, urinalysis, and coagulation analyzers, as well as associated consumable products that provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results. Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include a broad range of single-use, IDEXX SNAP &#160; rapid assay test kits that provide quick, accurate, and convenient point-of-care diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal disease causing pathogens and health conditions. Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments. \n\n&#160; Blood and Urine Chemistry . We have three blood and urine chemistry analyzers that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting \n\nin diagnosing physiologic conditions. We actively sell the Catalyst One Chemistry analyzer. We continue to support our Catalyst Dx and VetTest Chemistry analyzers. We also support the VetStat Electrolyte and Blood Gas analyzer. Sales of consumables to customers who use our chemistry analyzers provide the majority of our instrument consumables revenues from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab instruments. \n\n&#160; Hematology . We sell three hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (also called a complete blood count). These analyzers include the ProCyte One and ProCyte Dx hematology analyzers. We also sell the Coag Dx analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders. While we currently do not sell the LaserCyte Dx hematology analyzer and the IDEXX VetAutoread hematology analyzer, we continue to support these analyzers. \n\n&#160; Rapid Assay . The SNAP rapid assays are single-use, handheld test kits that can work without the use of instrumentation, although many kits may also be activated with results automatically captured and interpreted by the SNAP Pro Analyzer. This device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results with the pet owner on the SNAP Pro Analyzer screen, or via VetConnect PLUS. Our SNAPshot Dx analyzer can run multiple patient samples at once. The principal canine SNAP rapid assay tests include SNAP 4Dx Plus, which tests for the six vector-borne diseases causing pathogens, including Lyme disease as well as canine heartworm, and SNAP Heartworm RT, which tests for heartworm. Sales of our canine vector-borne disease tests are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practices in the Northern Hemisphere. The principal feline SNAP rapid assay tests include SNAP Feline Triple, which tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (&#8220;FIV&#8221;) (which is similar to the virus that leads to AIDS in humans), feline leukemia virus (&#8220;FeLV&#8221;) and heartworm, and SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for FIV and FeLV. \n\n&#160; Urinalysis . The SediVue Dx analyzer is designed to provide automated real-time results in a fraction of the time of manual microscope analysis, which allows veterinary staff to perform a urine sediment analysis in approximately 3 minutes. The IDEXX VetLab UA analyzer provides rapid, automated capture of semi-quantitative chemical urinalysis from IDEXX UA strips and is validated specifically for veterinary use. \n\n&#160; IDEXX VetLab Station . The IDEXX VetLab Station (&#8220;IVLS&#8221;) connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab analyzers, and thus, provides reference laboratory information management system capability. IVLS also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to VetConnect PLUS. We sell IVLS as an integral component for our in-clinic analyzer suite. \n\nOutside Reference Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services . We offer commercial reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians in many developed geographies worldwide, including customers in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, and Brazil, through a network of approximately 80 laboratories. Customers use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Most test results have same-day or next-day turnaround times. Our diagnostic laboratory business also provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to biomedical research customers in North America, Europe, and Asia. \n\nOur reference laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in animals, including all tests that can be run in-clinic at the veterinary practice with our instruments or rapid assays. This menu of tests also includes a number of specialized tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevant diseases and conditions in dogs and cats, including parasites, heart disease, allergies, pancreatitis, diabetes, renal disease, and infectious diseases. We also offer cancer screening to aid in diagnosis, assist in therapy selection, and support therapy management and monitoring. \n\nAdditionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine, and advisory services, including radiology, cardiology, internal medicine, and ultrasound consulting. These services enable veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the Internet. \n\nVeterinary Software and Services &#38; Diagnostic Imaging Systems \n\nVeterinary Software and Services. We develop, market, and sell a portfolio of software and services for independent veterinary clinics and corporate groups. This portfolio includes: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Practice management systems . Software, hardware, and integrated services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling, client communication, billing, and inventory management. Our practice information management systems offerings include cloud-based ezyVet, Animana, IDEXX Neo, and Cornerstone Cloud, and on-premise Cornerstone and DVMAX. To support the software system needs of practices, IDEXX provides integrated services including: Payment Solutions, Data Backup &#38; Recovery, and Practice Supplies. \n\n&#160; Software applications that extend workflow capabilities for practices and groups . We are able to improve overall patient management and workflow optimization through coordination and tracking of every step of a patient during a hospital stay. Our SmartFlow cloud offering works in conjunction with major veterinary practice management systems, including ezyVet, Cornerstone, Animana, IDEXX Neo, DVMAX, and certain third-party practice management systems, and VetRadar provides workflow capability for ezyVet. \n\n&#160; Client marketing and wellness plan management . In addition, we offer cloud-based client communication (Pet Health Network Pro and Pet Health Network 3D) and preventive care plan management software (Petly Plans) designed to strengthen the relationship between the veterinarian and the pet owner. To support the communication needs between general practices and specialty referral practices, IDEXX offers rVetLink software. Lastly, IDEXX Enterprise provides centralized management and reporting capabilities for groups of veterinary practices. \n\nDiagnostic Imaging Systems . Our diagnostic imaging systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. We market and sell two diagnostic imaging systems primarily used in small animal veterinary applications: the IDEXX ImageVue DR50 and the IDEXX ImageVue DR30. \n\nOur diagnostic imaging systems employ picture archiving and communication system (&#8220;PACS&#8221;) software called IDEXX-PACS, which facilitates radiographic image capture and review. IDEXX Web PACS is our cloud-based software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) offering for viewing, accessing, storing, and sharing multi-modality diagnostic images. IDEXX Web PACS is integrated with Cornerstone, ezyVet, IDEXX Neo, DVMAX, and IDEXX VetConnect &#160; PLUS to provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging results alongside patient diagnostic results from any internet connected device. \n\nIDEXX I-Vision Mobile is a software application that allows veterinarians with IDEXX digital radiography systems the ability to request, view and send images using an iPad &#174; mobile tablet. This application integrates with our IDEXX-PACS software. \n\nWe believe that the breadth of our full diagnostic solution, including novel products and services developed and made available only by IDEXX, as well as the seamless software integration of our offering, provide a differentiated competitive advantage by giving veterinarians the tools and services to offer advanced veterinary medical care. We believe that with the use of our products and services, veterinary practices significantly improve the quality of veterinary care provided to their patients, increase staff efficiencies, and better communicate the value of this medical care to the pet owner. We believe that these capabilities, enabled by the use of IDEXX products and services, improve the effectiveness and financial health of the veterinary practice. \n\nWater quality products (&#8220;Water&#8221;) - Water provides innovative testing solutions for easy, rapid, and accurate detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water. \n\nWater testing . Our principal products are the Colilert, Colilert-18, and Colisure tests, which detect the presence of total coliforms and E. coli in water. These organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. Our products utilize nutrient-indicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities, and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, wastewater, and water from private wells. We also sell consumables, parts, and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products. During the third quarter of \n\n2022, we acquired TECTA-PDS, a Canadian-based water testing company with customers in more than 50 countries. Through this acquisition, we are able to provide an automated rapid microbiology monitoring system to detect total coliforms and E. coli or enterococci in water. The TECTA-PDS test has also been approved by the EPA for detecting total coliforms and E. coli for drinking water compliance testing. IDEXX also offers the following products: \n\nEnterolert . Our Enterolert products detect the presence of enterococci in drinking, waste, and recreational waters. Enterococci, bacteria normally found in human and animal waste, are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. \n\n&#160; Pseudalert . Our Pseudalert products detect the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pool, spa, and bottled water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen that can cause &#8220;hot-tub rash,&#8221; &#8220;swimmer&#8217;s ear,&#8221; and potentially fatal infections in individuals with weakened immune systems. \n\n&#160; Filta-Max and Filta-Max &#160; xpress . Our Filta-Max and Filta-Max &#160; xpress products are used in the detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in water. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. We also distribute certain water testing kits manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. that complement our Cryptosporidium and Giardia testing products. \n\n&#160; Legiolert . Our Legiolert product is a simple culture method test for the detection of Legionella pneumophila, the most common Legionella species in water and the primary cause of Legionnaires&#8217; disease. The Legiolert test is designed to be used on potable or non-potable water sources with results in seven days. \n\n&#160; Quanti-Tray products . Our Quanti-Tray products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Enterolert, Pseudalert, Heterotrophic Plate Count (&#8220;HPC&#8221;) or Legiolert products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presence/absence indication. Our Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS, and Quanti-Tray Sealer 2X are used with the Quanti-Tray products for the determination of bacterial density in water samples. Our SimPlate and EasyDisc for HPC products detect the total number of the most common bacteria in a water sample. \n\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy (&#8220;LPD&#8221;) - LPD provides diagnostic tests, services, and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve producer efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk. \n\nLivestock, Poultry, Heard Health Screening and Production Management . We sell diagnostic tests, services and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve producer efficiency. Our livestock and poultry diagnostic products are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services to livestock veterinarians, producers, and processors, and also directly by livestock veterinarians and producers. Our herd health screening services are offered to livestock veterinarians and producers. Our principal livestock and poultry diagnostic products include tests for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (&#8220;BVDV&#8221;), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (&#8220;PRRS&#8221;), and African Swine Fever (&#8220;ASFV&#8221;). BVDV is a common and contagious viral infection that suppresses the immune system, making the animal susceptible to a host of other infections, and impacting beef and dairy production yields as a result. PRRS is a contagious virus causing reproductive problems and respiratory diseases in swine, leading to increased piglet mortality, reduced growth, and vulnerability to secondary infections. Our RealPCR ASFV Test is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (&#8220;PCR&#8221;) assay that provides early and accurate detection of ASFV supporting prevention, control, and eradication programs by veterinarians and producers. We also sell our Alertys Ruminant Pregnancy Test, Rapid Visual Pregnancy Test and Alertys On-Farm Pregnancy Test for cattle, which can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding using whole blood samples. \n\nDairy products . Our principal dairy products use our SNAP test platform and are used by dairy producers and processors worldwide to detect antibiotic drug residue in milk. Our primary product lines are SNAP Beta-Lactam ST and SNAPduo Beta-Tetra ST, which detect certain beta lactam and tetracycline antibiotic residues. We also sell SNAP &#160; tests for the detection of certain other contaminants in milk, such as Aflatoxin M1. \n\nOther - Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products and services business (&#8220;OPTI Medical&#8221;) with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. \n\nOPTI Medical. Through OPTI &#160; Medical, we sell point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose, lactate, blood urea nitrogen and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These OPTI analyzers are used primarily \n\nin emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas, and other locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. The OPTI CCA-TS2 analyzer runs whole blood, plasma, and serum samples on single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. We also provide human testing solutions for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as influenza A and B. \n\nOther Activities. We own certain drug delivery technology intellectual property, that we continue to seek to commercialize through agreements with third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies, which are included in the Other segment. \n\nAdditional information about our products and services can be found on our website. Information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this annual report or any other filing we make with the SEC. \n\nMARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION \n\nWe market, sell, and service our products worldwide through our marketing, customer service, sales, and technical service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in all major regions including Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, Europe, Middle East, and Latin America. \n\nGenerally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements, and other factors. We market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians directly in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide, generally through our direct sales force. We market our diagnostic imaging products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. We market our software products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. We market our Water and LPD products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through selected independent distributors. We sell our OPTI products and services both directly and through independent human medical product distributors. \n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n\nOur business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each of our business segments. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, certain licensing agreements, materials and external consulting and development costs, were $254.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, or 7.6% of our consolidated revenue, $161.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, or 5.0% of our consolidated revenue and $141.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or 5.2% of our consolidated revenue. \n\nPATENTS AND LICENSES \n\nWe actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties. Patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to us based on a variety of factors, including providing protection for our inventions and other intellectual property; affording protection from competitors in certain sectors; enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings; strengthening our reputation and standing among customers, employees, and key suppliers; and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters, imitators, and other copiers of technologies. \n\nImportant patents and licenses include those related to: \n\n&#8226; Catalyst &#160; consumables that began to expire in 2020 and will continue into 2035; \n\n&#8226; Catalyst instruments that expire beginning in 2026 and will continue into 2032; \n\n&#8226; Reagents and methods for the detection of canine pancreatic lipase that expire in 2026; and \n\n&#8226; Patents relating to reagents and methods for the detection of SDMA that expire beginning in 2029 and will continue into 2037. \n\nWhile we consider these technology rights to be important to us, a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position. These factors include publications, including peer-reviewed third-party studies, that demonstrate the accuracy of our products; our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; our online ordering platform that enables direct ordering of (including establishing automatic reorder schedules for) our consumables, tests and other products by our customers; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents; our investment in diagnostic innovations that results in new product offerings that often are patentable and that expand the test menu for our in-clinic instruments and/or reference laboratory business; and our significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments. Although we have certain patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that are expected to expire in future years, the expiration of these patents and licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations. In addition, we already face robust competition as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market, despite the protections afforded by these technology rights. \n\nTo the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights, or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. Refer to &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nPRODUCTION AND SUPPLY \n\nMany of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties. We rely on third parties in our supply chain to supply us, and our direct suppliers, with certain important components, raw materials, and consumables used in or with our products. In some cases, these third parties are sole or single-source suppliers. From time to time, we seek to qualify alternative suppliers. \n\nInstruments and consumables . Significant products supplied by sole and single-source providers include certain Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One consumables (other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine, T4, CRP, progesterone, and SDMA, and Bile Acid slides), VetTest slides, VetLyte consumables, LaserCyte Dx consumables, VetAutoread and ProCyte Dx analyzers and consumables, SediVue Dx urinalysis instruments and consumables, and certain components of our internally manufactured analyzers. \n\nCertain Catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire in December of 2031. We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of Catalyst chemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. The agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment. The agreements also prohibit Ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary sector, excluding the EU, other than to IDEXX. \n\nWe purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2034, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements. Refer to &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nOther components . We purchase certain other products, raw materials, and components from sole and single-source suppliers. These products include certain diagnostic imaging systems and certain components used in our SNAP rapid assay and dairy devices, livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products. \n\nWe have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single-source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. Refer to &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nProduct quality and safety . We believe that product quality and safety are essential to our business. We conduct our operations within an Integrated Management System, which encompasses our Quality Assurance program, to help ensure compliance with applicable regulations, product safety requirements and standards, and customer requirements. This Integrated Management System includes strict manufacturing processes and procedures, employee training, ongoing process \n\nimprovement, product quality risk management procedures, incident investigation and corrective action procedures, and internal and third-party auditing. Our manufacturing and distribution facilities in Westbrook, Maine; Memphis, Tennessee; and the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and the United Kingdom are certified to the ISO 9001 quality standard, and certain of our other facilities are certified to the environmental (ISO 14001) and testing and calibration laboratory (ISO 17025) quality standards. ISO quality standards are internationally recognized manufacturing standards established by the International Organization for Standardization, which are audited and certified by third-party auditors in addition to our internal self-audits. We also require our key suppliers to have quality management systems that comply with recognized industry standards, such as ISO 9001, and are aligned with our quality requirements, and we regularly conduct audits with our Tier 1 suppliers to verify control systems meet all our requirements. In addition, we make available instructions and other information to help ensure the proper and safe use of our products. \n\nBACKLOG \n\nWe do not generally maintain a significant backlog of orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales. \n\nCOMPETITION \n\nWe compete with many companies ranging from large human and animal health pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health. Our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and in-clinic product providers. Our competitors vary in our different business areas and regions. In some cases, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services, which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Several of our direct and potential competitors have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us, as well as greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development, and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do. For more information on risks related to our competition, refer to &#8220;Part I, Item 1A.

We compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Abbott Diagnostics, a division of Abbott Laboratories and Roche Diagnostics Corporation. \n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION \n\nMany of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, product registrations, manufacturing, import, export, distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, product disposal, environmental compliance, and workplace safety. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses. \n\nVeterinary diagnostic products . Our veterinary diagnostic products including instruments, such as Catalyst One and ProCyte One, as well as their corresponding consumables, are veterinary medical devices regulated by the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the &#8220;FDC Act&#8221;). Other FDA regulated products include our rapid assay products such as SNAP devices and ELISA plates. While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to FDA inspections or the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;), the FDA Act specifies that these products must not be adulterated, mislabeled, or misbranded. \n\nA subset of our veterinary diagnostic products, including our diagnostic test kits for companion and food animal infectious diseases, as well as most of our livestock and poultry products and many of our rapid assay products, are licensed and regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (&#8220;APHIS&#8221;). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in and from the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product validation data, including manufacturing process and facility documentation. Following regulatory licensure to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for test review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval to support product registration for sale, distribution, and use within their countries. However, compliance with extensive country-specific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing and marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil, the Netherlands, China, and many other countries. We are also required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine which also covers our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our LPD manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France is a USDA-permitted site, and has been approved by APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. \n\nWater testing products . Our water tests are generally not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is regulated by the EPA, the test method must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA, and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Quanti-Tray, Filta-Max xpress , Enterolert, and SimPlate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the EPA for use under various regulatory programs. Water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world. \n\nDairy testing products . Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (&#8220;NCIMS&#8221;) milk-monitoring programs in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as veterinary medical devices. Before these products can be sold in the U.S., performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA-approved protocol administered by an independent body, such as the Association of Analytical Chemists Research Institute (&#8220;AOAC RI&#8221;). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be accepted by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes state, federal, and industry representatives. Our SNAP Beta-Lactam antibiotic residue test product has been accepted by the FDA, NCIMS, and AOAC RI for sale in the U.S. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI certification as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes. \n\nHuman point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers . Our OPTI instrument systems are classified by the FDA as Class I and/or Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture, and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI products. The FDA&#8217;s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide for \n\ninspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA via a 510(k) application before marketing or sale of such products. These OPTI products are also subject to the regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold, including the EU Medical Devices Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation. \n\nHuman COVID-19 test products . OPTI manufactures, sells, and distributes PCR and antibody ELISA test kits for the detection of the virus that causes COVID-19. These test kits are subject to regulation by the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act, and more specifically, are sold and distributed pursuant to FDA Emergency Use Authorization. These products are also subject to the regulations governing the manufacturing and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold, including the EU Medical Devices Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulations. \n\nOther Chemical, Environmental, and Human Health Safety Regulations . All IDEXX products must comply with applicable global product regulations, including those governing consumer product safety and materials requirements such as the Europeans Union's Electromagnetic Compatibility (&#8220;EMC&#8221;) Directive, the European Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (&#8220;REACH&#8221;), the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;) Directive, and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&#8220;WEEE&#8221;) Directive. These complex regulatory requirements create risk to IDEXX&#8217;s ability to market and sell our products, our business, and our financial performance. For more information about the risks associated with various U.S. and foreign government regulation, refer to &#8220; Various U.S. and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business&#8221; under &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nIn the European Union, our analyzers and certain associated equipment are subject to the requirements of the RoHS Directive, which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. Other countries, including China, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey have implemented or anticipate implementing regulatory regimes similar to the RoHS Directive. Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are not subject to regulation under the European Medical Device Directive or the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive, which are both strictly applicable to human use products. However, these systems are required to meet CE certification, which require compliance with the RoHS Directive, the EMC Directive, and other safety requirements. Most countries in which we sell our products impose similar registrations and/or certification requirements. \n\nThe European Union was among the first to regulate and restrict the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products. These requirements include the Biocidal Products Regulation, which requires the use of only approved biocides in our products imported to or used in the European Union, and REACH, which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the European Union. Compliance with these regulations (and similar regulations that have been or may be adopted elsewhere, such as Australia, China, Russia, Turkey, Korea, and other countries) may require registration, notification, or certification regarding regulated substances, imposition of import restrictions, or in certain cases the redesign or reformulation of our products. Some of our products, including some of our Companion Animal products, may be subject to pending restriction of microplastics pursuant to REACH. \n\nIn the U.S., the EPA regulates chemical use similarly to the European Union. In addition, certain states have their own chemical regulations, such as California's Proposition 65, which requires businesses to provide warnings to California residents about significant risk of exposures to chemicals in products that are known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which may be contained in certain IDEXX products, are a subject of increasing regulatory attention. Both the EPA and the European Union have proposed draft regulations regarding PFAS, which include restrictions, data gathering and/or phase-out requirements. In the U.S., a number of states, including Maine, where we manufacture many of our products, have also developed product reporting and/or phase-out requirements. Maine&#8217;s statute requires that effective as of January 1, 2023, manufacturers of products with intentionally-added PFAS report the presence of such substances, and specifies that (subject to certain exceptions to be promulgated by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection) no product containing intentionally-added PFAS may be sold in Maine after January 1, 2030. We have applied for an extension for compliance with the reporting requirement. \n\nIn addition to the foregoing, our business is generally subject to various U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;) and other anti-competition authorities, and we are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, import and export laws and regulations, including U.S. import and export control and sanctions laws, and laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Development or acquisition of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve medical device, water-quality and other regulations of the FDA, the EPA, the USDA, the FTC, and other federal agencies, as well as state, local and foreign governments. \n\nHUMAN CAPITAL \n\nAs innovation and customer focus are important parts of our strategy to create long-term value, we aim to attract, motivate, develop, and retain talented employees at all levels who are aligned with and passionate about our Purpose by: \n\n&#8226; Building and sustaining an inclusive, ethical culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;); \n\n&#8226; Offering competitive and locally relevant compensation and benefits; and \n\n&#8226; Providing growth and development opportunities. \n\nBecause our strategy includes developing strong, deep relationships with our veterinary customers, we have focused on growing our companion animal diagnostics field-based organization globally. \n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We believe that promoting DEI among our employees helps drive both innovation and a better understanding of our increasingly global customer base. We employ inclusive recruitment practices to source diverse candidates and mitigate potential bias. Our global recruiting team connects our sourcing strategies with diversified talent channels and adopts core competencies that focus on valuing differences, to attract candidates with different backgrounds, ideas, and experiences who will further enrich our culture. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 10,780 regular full-time and part-time employees, with underrepresented minorities representing an estimated 23.7% of our U.S. employees, as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Self-Identified Racial or Ethnic Background (1) \n\nBlack/African American 8.7 % Asian 6.5 % Hispanic/Latinx 6.1 % \n\nOther (2) \n\n2.1 % White 75.5 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Data regarding racial and ethnic background are based on self-identification by our U.S. employees; underrepresented minorities is defined as Black/African American, Asian, Hispanic/Latinx and Other. The percentages provided do not add up to 100% because some U.S. employees declined to specify race and/or ethnicity. \n\n(2) Other is defined as American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races. \n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2022, women represented 58% of our global employee population and were represented in leadership as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Percentage who self- identify as women Global People Managers 49.2 % \n\nGlobal Senior Leadership Team (1) \n\n34.2 % \n\nGlobal Senior Executive Team (2) \n\n21.1 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Global Senior Leaders are employees in compensation grades considered Director or above. \n\n(2) Global Senior Executives are employees in compensation grades considered Senior Vice President or above. \n\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being . We offer fair, competitive compensation and a wide array of competitive and locally relevant benefits (which vary by country and region) that support our employees&#8217; overall well-being, including comprehensive health and welfare insurance; generous time-off and leave; retirement and financial support. We provide free counseling for employees and their dependents globally through our mental wellness partner and Employee Assistance Program. Interactive holistic well-being resources are available to employees globally, including monthly educational webinars, ergonomic support, team fitness challenges, nutrition programs, and self-guided courses on a broad range of topics. In addition, all employees have access to financial education and our employees, their spouses and adult dependents in North America, can engage with a financial coach for help reaching their personal financial goals. \n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally in early 2020, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These included having employees work from home, if their job duties allowed, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our offices are open and we follow public health guidance and protocols, while continuing to support flexible work options. We promote a positive workplace environment and build a collaborative culture through in-person and virtual events, including town halls, in-office celebrations, and employee-led communities. We monitor the state of the pandemic to ensure the continued safety and health of our employees. \n\nEnsuring the health, safety, and well-being of our employees is a top priority at IDEXX. We provide our employees with the training, tools, and resources they need to safeguard their health and we empower them to put safety first. Our Environmental Health &#38; Safety (&#8220;EH&#38;S&#8221;) team oversees the IDEXX EH&#38;S management system and our company-wide safety programs, ensuring that all of our locations implement health and safety processes to maintain and improve employee safety, reduce workplace risks, and drive continuous improvement. \n\nGrowth and Development . We are steadfast in our focus on cultivating the diverse leaders of tomorrow and making career development opportunities more accessible across the company. Much of training programs are 100% virtual and available in multiple languages. Our career development programs are designed to build capabilities and enable career progression. We also encourage employees to enhance their career development through job-related courses and degree programs. \n\nEmployee Turnover and Engagement . We monitor employee turnover and engagement to identify opportunities to strengthen our approach to human capital management. During 2022, our overall voluntary employee turnover rate was 13.3%. Our voluntary turnover among managerial employees was 6.6%. \n\nWe regularly conduct company-wide employee surveys through a third party to collect employee input \n\non our culture, their experiences, and workplace conditions. These survey results provide insights that help us to improve employee engagement. Our most recent global employee survey received a high level of response and indicated an 84% engagement level. We leverage the insights gained from the survey to develop a roadmap for improving engagement and retention. \n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION \n\nOur principal executive offices are located at One IDEXX Drive, Westbrook, Maine 04092, our telephone number is 207-556-0300, and our internet address is www.idexx.com.

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nYou should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our company and our business. Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY \n\nBecause our business lines are highly attractive, they are also highly competitive. Our failure to successfully execute certain strategies within this competitive environment could have a material negative impact on our future growth and profitability \n\nThe companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive, and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new sector entrants given our performance and the industry&#8217;s strong growth and returns. Our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, including: \n\n&#8226; Developing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive in-clinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab instruments, grow our installed base of instruments, and increase demand for related recurring sales of consumable products, services, and accessories; \n\n&#8226; Developing and introducing new or improved innovative diagnostic tests and services for both our reference laboratories and in-clinic applications that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors; \n\n&#8226; Developing and introducing new or improved innovative, data-insightful software solutions that enable our veterinary customers to improve practice management and efficiency, staff productivity, and client communications and that increase the value to our veterinary customers of our other companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of the information and transactions of these products and services and supporting the interpretation and management of diagnostic information derived from these products and services; \n\n&#8226; Maintaining premium pricing, including by effectively implementing price increases, for our differentiated products and services through, among other things, effective communication and promotion of the value of our products and services in an environment where many of our competitors promote, market, and sell lesser offerings at prices lower than ours; \n\n&#8226; Providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools, information, and resources that enable them to grow their practices and increase utilization of our diagnostic products and services, through increased pet visits, use of preventive care protocols, enhanced practice of real-time care, and improved practice efficiency; \n\n&#8226; Achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of reference laboratories by implementing global best practices, including lean processing techniques, incorporating technological enhancements, including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system, employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale, increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs; \n\n&#8226; Achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our in-clinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead, and by improving reliability of our instruments; \n\n&#8226; Continuing to expand, develop, and advance the productivity of our companion animal diagnostic sales, marketing, customer support, and logistics organizations in the U.S. and international regions in support of, among other things, our all-direct sales strategies; \n\n&#8226; Attracting, developing, and retaining key leadership and talent necessary to support all elements of our strategy, which is challenging due to the increasingly competitive and tight labor markets in which we operate, as well as public health issues, including pandemics, such as the COVID-19-related pandemic impacts on the workforce; \n\n&#8226; Strengthening our sales and marketing activities to continue to grow our profitability both in and outside the U.S.; \n\n&#8226; Identifying, completing, and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses, create new businesses for us or expand the geographic areas in which we do business; \n\n&#8226; Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and \n\n&#8226; Continuing to effectively manage our growth and expansion on a global scale through, among other things, designing and implementing cost-effective improvements to our processes, procedures, and infrastructure. \n\nIf we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted. \n\nOur dependence on third-party suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results \n\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide components and raw materials (including biological materials) for our manufactured products, manufacture some of the products that we sell, and perform certain services, including package-delivery services. Actions taken by third-party suppliers in operating their business, as well as any disruptions to their business operations (or their suppliers' business operations), could disrupt our supply chain or operations and materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs, and damage our reputation with our customers. Longer-term disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of our customers, which could reduce our recurring revenues and long-term profitability. \n\nOur supply chain and our cost of goods also may be adversely impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors such as inflation (including wage inflation), supply restrictions beyond our control or the control of our suppliers, or regulatory requirements regarding the importation, exportation, composition, or production processes of the goods or materials provided by our suppliers. If current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods or materials that comply with applicable regulatory requirements to us on a timely basis, or at all, or are unable to comply with any due diligence requests that may be required pursuant to applicable law or regulation, we could experience inventory shortages and disruptions in our supply of goods or materials. \n\nFor examples of some of the events that could result in disruption to our supply chain or operations, and negatively impact our operating results, refer to &#8220;Various U.S. and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business,&#8221; &#8220;We are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business&#8221; and &#8220;Factors and events beyond our control could disrupt our operations, supply chain, and logistics network and adversely affect our business&#8221; below. \n\nIn addition, we currently purchase many products, components, and materials from sole or single sources. Some of these products are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products, components, and materials are used in a majority of our instruments, including our Catalyst Dx, Catalyst One, ProCyte Dx, and ProCyte One analyzers; consumables and accessories used in our instruments; livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, dairy testing products, and water testing products. Even if products, components, and materials were to become available to us from alternative suppliers, we likely would incur additional costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials, and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In certain cases, we may be required to obtain regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers, and this process of approval could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely. \n\nWe seek to mitigate sole and single-source suppliers risks on a risk-prioritized basis and in a variety of ways, including, when possible, by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers, developing applicable in-house manufacturing capabilities and expertise, and entering into escrow arrangements for manufacturing information for certain single or sole-sourced products. We also seek to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable or fixed prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement any of these mitigating activities or that, if implemented, any of them will be effective in preventing any delay or other disruption in our ability to supply our customers. In addition, suppliers may decline to enter into long-term contracts for any number of reasons, which would require us to purchase products, components, or raw materials via short-term contracts or on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have long-term contracts will continue to supply our requirements, will always fulfill their obligations under those contracts, or will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements. In cases where we purchase sole and single-source products, components, or raw materials under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products, components, or raw materials in the future from sole and single-source suppliers, or if such sole \n\nand single-source suppliers are unable to obtain the components or other materials required to manufacture the products, we may be unable to supply our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and any longer-term disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of customers, which could reduce our recurring revenues and long-term profitability. \n\nOur biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture, which could negatively affect our ability to supply our customers &#160; \n\nMany of our rapid assay, livestock and poultry diagnostic, water, and dairy products are biologic products that include biological materials, such as antibodies, cells, and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological materials and the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products, samples, and the environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria and regulatory requirements. Further, products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory, which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products, either of which could damage customer relations. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply our customers with these products, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nVarious U.S. and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business \n\nAs a global business, we sell products and services in more than 175 countries and operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by federal agencies, such as the USDA, the FDA, and the EPA. Our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases, including most rapid assay canine and feline SNAP tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our dairy testing products, as well as the manufacture and sale of our OPTI line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers, require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The methods used by our water testing products must be approved by the EPA, as a part of its water quality monitoring program, before they can be used by customers in the U.S. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability. \n\nWe are also subject to chemical regulation in the U.S., such as California&#8217;s Proposition 65, which requires businesses to provide warnings to California residents about significant risk of exposures to chemicals in products that are known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. In addition, governmental authorities in the U.S. are increasingly focused on preventing environmental contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (&#8220;PFAS&#8221;), which may be contained in certain IDEXX products. For example, the state of Maine requires reporting of intentionally-added PFAS in products, and the sale in Maine of any product containing intentionally-added PFAS will be prohibited after January 1, 2030 (subject to certain exceptions to be promulgated by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection). In addition, federal and state governments and agencies are in various stages of considering and/or implementing laws and regulations requiring the reporting, restriction and/or phase-out of PFAS in products. \n\nThe manufacture, import, and sale of our products, as well as our research and development processes, are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries. For example, the European Union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes. These regulations include, but are not limited to, the Biocidal Products Regulation, which requires the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being manufactured, used, or sold in the European Union; the European Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances, or REACH, which regulates and restricts the use of chemicals in the European Union; the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;) Directive, which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment; the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive; and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. In addition, European Union regulatory authorities and certain European countries are contemplating regulations to restrict and phase-out PFAS. \n\nCompliance with these and similar laws, directives and regulations in the U.S. and abroad may require registration of the applicable substances, performance of due diligence across our supply chain and reporting thereon, and/or the redesign or reformulation of our products, and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services or lead us to change our suppliers in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with our due diligence requests or the applicable regulations in a timely and cost-effective manner. In extreme situations, compliance with these laws, \n\ndirectives and regulations may require us to eliminate or discontinue the use of a part or component in one or more products, but the redesign or reformulation of such products without such parts or components may not be possible. Any redesign or reformulation, change in our suppliers, or restrictions in our supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services, add testing lead-times for products and reformulated products, reduce our margins, result in additional costs, or have other similar effects. Any inability to redesign or reformulate one or more of our products may preclude us from marketing and selling such products in the applicable regions. In addition, the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant. Any of these could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change, and we continue to evaluate their impact. \n\nIn addition, some foreign governments require us to register or certify our products before they can be distributed or sold, and these product registration requirements, which vary among the applicable jurisdictions and change from time to time, are often complex and require us to engage in lengthy and costly processes and provide confidential, proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies. For example, compliance with extensive country-specific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing, marketing, and selling our diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil, the Netherlands, China, and many other countries. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any product registration required by one or more foreign governments. Any inability to obtain or maintain a required product registration in a jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to market and sell the applicable product in that jurisdiction, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can also be no assurance that confidential, proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies may not be accessed by unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen, which could negatively impact our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success. For more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services, refer to &#8220;Our success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation&#8221; below. \n\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations governing our global business practices. For example, jurisdictions in which we operate prohibit bribery and corruption, anti-competitive behavior, and money laundering; impose trade compliance requirements and restrictions, such as prohibitions on doing business with certain entities or individuals; determine rules impacting the importation and exportation of our products; and regulate immigration and travel. These legal, regulatory, and sometimes politically motivated requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements and adjusting to changing legal and political environments are significant and likely to increase in the future. \n\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, or to adjust to changing legal and political environments, could result in fines, penalties, and sanctions; product recalls; suspensions or discontinuations of, or limitations or restrictions on, our ability to design, manufacture, market, import, export or sell our products; and damage to our reputation. Any of these could negatively impact our business. \n\nOur success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation \n\nWe believe our future success significantly depends on our ability to continue, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to enhance our existing differentiated product and service offerings and to develop and introduce new and innovative differentiated products and services. As a result, we invest substantial funds and efforts into R&#38;D, investigating new products and technologies being developed by third parties, and obtaining certain such new products and technologies through licenses or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that our R&#38;D, licensing, or acquisition efforts will achieve expected results, when or whether any of our products or services now under development will be launched, or whether we may be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire new products or technologies. We also cannot predict whether any product or service offering, once launched, will achieve market acceptance, or achieve sales and revenue consistent with our expectations. \n\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. We also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of third-party technologies in the development, production, and provision of our products and services. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license third-party patents and technologies on reasonable terms, our business may be adversely affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies to compete with us. \n\nWe cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents \n\ncover products or services sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition for products or services previously covered by those patent rights. \n\nIn the past, we have received notices claiming that our products or services infringe third-party patents, and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be prohibited from selling certain products or services and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nIncreased competition from and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results \n\nWe face intense competition, and we expect that future competition will become even more intense as new products, services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the space. Our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic sector in the United States and abroad include companies that develop, manufacture, and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories, certain large and well-funded animal health pharmaceutical companies, as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals, such as VCA Inc., which is wholly owned by Mars, Incorporated, another operator of corporate hospital chains. Consolidation among our competitors and our customers may intensify the competition we face. While we believe that our offerings are competitively differentiated due to our innovative products and services (such as the IDEXX SDMA test and VetConnect Plus) that offer an integrated, comprehensive diagnostic solution and the quality of our technical and customer service, there can be no assurance that increased consolidation among our competitors or customers (as well as any resulting reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers) would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete successfully. For more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers, refer to &#8220;Consolidation in our customer base, including through increased corporate hospital ownership, and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business&#8221; below. \n\nCompetition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways. New competitors may emerge through the development of innovative new technology, the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire. New or existing competitors may introduce new, innovative, and competitive products and services, which could be superior, or be perceived by our customers to be superior, to our products and services or lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products or services. Business combinations and mergers among our competitors may result in competitors that are better positioned to create, market, and sell more compelling product and service offerings. While an important aspect of our strategy is to continue, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new and innovative products and services, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such products and services or that those products or services will be superior to our competitors&#8217; products or services or otherwise achieve customer acceptance. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services perceived in the eyes of customers as similar, at substantially lower sales prices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of sales and/or revenues or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through co-marketing or other arrangements, which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offerings. Certain of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, also have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us, as well as greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development, and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do. \n\nConsolidation in our customer base, including through increased corporate hospital ownership, and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business \n\nVeterinarians are our primary customers for our CAG products and services, and the veterinary services industry in the U.S. and abroad has been consolidating at an accelerating rate in recent years. In the United States, the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining, and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include Mars, Incorporated (owner of Banfield Pet Hospitals, Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, Pet Partners and VCA Inc.), and National Veterinary Associates, and are joined by dozens of other consolidators. A similar trend exists in other regions such as Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Brazil. Furthermore, an \n\nincreasing percentage of individually-owned veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are participating in buying consortiums. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations. While we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums, decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations from the loss of future business. Under these circumstances, we may receive customer contract resolution payments, which would generally be recorded in other operating income in the period received. Nonetheless, the loss of future revenue may still be significant and adversely affect our future revenue growth rate and profitability. In addition, certain corporate owners also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies generally attempt to shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies, and there can be no assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories. Furthermore, because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace, hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline. \n\nChanges in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results &#160; \n\nDemand for our companion animal, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. The outbreak of certain diseases (such as African swine fever) among livestock or poultry, or the adverse impact of climate change-related events (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods), could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of such animals in the affected regions, reducing herd or flock sizes, which could reduce the demand for our testing products for such animals. Changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our livestock and poultry, dairy and water products. In addition, changes and trends in local dairy, poultry, or other food sectors around the world could negatively affect the related production markets resulting in a decline in demand for our testing products. Economic weakness may also reduce demand for our companion animal, water, livestock, poultry, and dairy products and services, and public health-related guidance and directives, including stay-at-home orders that may be further deployed to combat public health issues, and possible higher infection rates could result in a decrease in companion animal clinical visits, the delay of elective procedures and wellness visits and disruption of veterinary clinic operations, all of which would have a negative effect on veterinary service providers and result in declines in demand for our CAG products and services. Declines in testing for any reason, including the reasons described above, along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe sell many products through distributors, which presents risks that could negatively affect our operating results \n\nSome of our international product sales occur through third-party distributors. As a result, we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products. Our distributors often offer products from several different companies, including our competitors, and may promote our competitors&#8217; products over our own products. We have limited ability, if any, to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting, marketing, selling, and supporting our products or to maintain certain inventory levels, and changes in our distributors&#8217; inventory levels, as compared to comparable prior periods, could negatively impact our revenue growth rates. There can be no assurances made that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market, sell, and support our products effectively. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. While we maintain a rigorous distribution compliance program, violations of anti-corruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and reputation, and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction. Failure to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the U.S. may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position, any of which could have a negative effect on our operating results. \n\nOur limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care and related human laboratory diagnostics sector could inhibit our success in this sector \n\nWe have limited experience in the human point-of-care and related human laboratory medical diagnostics sector, and we operate at a small scale in this area. This sector differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic sector. Significant differences include the impact of third-party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base, and more rapid technological innovation. Our limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care and laboratory medical diagnostics sector could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this sector that differ from the veterinary diagnostic sector. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care and laboratory medical diagnostics sector comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic sector. \n\nGENERAL RISKS \n\nWe depend on the efforts of key personnel and talent to succeed and compete effectively \n\nOur continued success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly capable, skilled, and diverse employees and leaders. As we continue to grow our business, expand our geographic scope, and develop and offer innovative, new products and services, we require an engaged, qualified workforce and the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for our senior leadership and other key personnel. Competition for experienced leaders and employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location, flexibility regarding virtual and hybrid work arrangements, work environment, corporate culture, and development opportunities. Furthermore, a more competitive labor market has made it more difficult and costly to attract qualified labor, and prolonged shortages could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. \n\nThe loss of the services of, or our failure to recruit or develop and implement effective succession plans for, our senior leadership, other key personnel, and employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives, disrupt our operations, and adversely affect our business and our future success. In addition, even if we effectively develop and implement succession plans and make key leadership transitions, we cannot provide assurances as to whether we may experience management or other challenges in connection with any of those leadership transitions that could adversely affect our future success and could otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health issues, including pandemics, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic and other events beyond our control. Public health issues and crises may adversely impact our operations, supply chain and logistics network if the locations where we operate, manufacture or distribute our products; where our raw materials or product components are sourced, manufactured or distributed; or where our third-party distributors, suppliers and other service providers operate, are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages for a sustained period of time. In addition, public health issues and crises may adversely impact our customers&#8217; businesses due to business lockdowns, decreased companion animal clinical visits, labor shortages, the delay of elective procedures and wellness visits, and disruption of veterinary clinic and other customer operations, all of which could cause a decline in demand for our products and services. These disruptions could also cause economic slowdowns or increased economic uncertainty. \n\nWhile we largely avoided any significant disruption to the business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a future public health issue, pandemic or outbreak of COVID-19 could lead to delays in the manufacturing and supply of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, any future public health issue such as a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, including due to new variants of the virus for which current vaccines may not be effective, could result in the imposition of new governmental restrictions, quarantine requirements or other measures to slow the spread of the virus, which could result in closures or other restrictions that significantly disrupt our operations or those of our third-party distributors, suppliers or other service providers, or otherwise adversely affect our customers&#8217; businesses or operations, or result in economic weakness or slowdowns in one or more of our key geographies, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition. \n\nWe are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business \n\nWe rely on our information systems, as well as our third-party business partners&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; information systems, to provide access to our web-based products and services, keep financial records, analyze results of operations, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions. Although we maintain security policies, employ system backup measures and engage in redundancy planning and processes, such policies, measures, planning and processes, as well as our current disaster recovery plans, may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities. Further, our information systems and our business partners&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; information systems have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, attacks by hackers and other security breaches, including, among other things, computer viruses and malware, ransomware, denial of service actions, the compromise or misappropriation of confidential or otherwise protected information and similar events through the internet (including via devices and applications connected to the internet), and through email attachments and persons with access to these information systems, such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business. The continued use of remote working and hybrid work-from-home arrangements may additionally result in some increased risk of attacks associated with a number of our employees accessing our data and systems remotely. In addition, security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cybersecurity attacks targeting U.S. organizations, such as IDEXX. \n\nAs information systems and the use of software and related applications by us, our business partners, suppliers, and customers become more cloud-based and connected to the &#8220;Internet of Things,&#8221; which is inherently susceptible to cyberattacks, there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, including more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information. We process credit card payments electronically over secure networks and also offer products and services that connect to and are part of the &#8220;Internet of Things,&#8221; such as our connected devices (e.g., IDEXX VetLab instruments). Any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. While we have implemented network security and internal control measures, especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks, and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure, these efforts have not always been successful in preventing, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will in the future prevent, a system disruption, attack, or security breach and, as such, there continues to be risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack. \n\nWe, and some of our third-party vendors, have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and will likely experience further attacks in the future, potentially with more frequency. To our knowledge, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. We have adopted measures to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats; however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions and the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, which vary in technique and sources, if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions, or our customers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational and/or productivity delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise or misappropriation of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses and additional costs from remedial actions, repairs to infrastructure, physical systems or data processing systems, increased cybersecurity and information technology protection costs, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Our customers and/or employees could also face negative consequences such as the compromise of sensitive or critical information or systems. Furthermore, access to, public disclosure of, or other loss of data or information (including any of our confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information) as a result of an attack or security breach has given, and in the future may give, rise to notification obligations to individuals, regulators, customers, employees, and others, and could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings, any of which could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, damage our ability to develop (and protect our rights to) our differentiated technologies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. For more information regarding data and information privacy and protection risks, refer to &#8220;Our operations and reputation may be impaired if we, our products, or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection&#8221; below. \n\nFactors and events beyond our control could disrupt our operations, supply chain, and logistics network and adversely affect our business \n\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively affected by certain factors and events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, severe weather conditions and/or climate change-related events (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods); public health issues (such as outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics); civil or military unrest; geopolitical conditions and developments; war, terrorism, armed conflict, or other man-made disasters (including cyber-war, cyber terrorism, or state-sponsored attacks arising out of the war between Russia and Ukraine); inflationary pressures, such as those the market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for materials and finished goods; adverse or uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including fears of a global economic downturn or recession; increases in wages that drive up prices; rising interest rates; workforce disruptions; labor shortages or stoppages; the imposition of regulations, trade protection measures, tariffs, duties, import/export restrictions, quotas or embargoes on key components; transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods; and the unavailability of raw materials. Any of these events could result in, among other things, damage to or the temporary closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or reference laboratories (damage to one of our facilities or the manufacturing equipment we use could be costly and may require substantial lead-time to repair or replace); damage to or closure of one or more facilities of our third-party business partners or suppliers on which we rely; a temporary lack of an adequate work force in one or more markets; an interruption in power supply; a temporary or long-term disruption in our supply chain or logistics network (including a disruption to our ability to obtain critical components for the manufacture of our products); a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver (or delays in the delivery of) our products or services; and short- or long-term damage to our customers&#8217; businesses (which would adversely impact customer demand for our products and services). For more information regarding the risks presented by disruption to our suppliers&#8217; operations and supply chain, refer to &#8220;Our dependence on third-party suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results&#8221; above. \n\nWe manufacture many of our significant companion animal products, including our rapid assay products and certain instruments and consumables, many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock, poultry, and dairy testing products, at a single facility in Westbrook, Maine. Certain of our companion animal products, as well as our human point-of-care products, are manufactured in Roswell, Georgia. We also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France. In addition, we maintain major distribution facilities in North America and in the Netherlands and major reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee; Kornwestheim, Germany; Sacramento, California; Elmhurst, Illinois; North Grafton, Massachusetts; East Brisbane, Australia; Markham, Ontario; Wetherby, U.K.; and Tokyo, Japan. Interruption of operations at any of these facilities due to the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWhile we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events. We also maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not compensate us for potential long-term competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations. \n\nSince our business is global in nature, geopolitical risks and other risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 35% of our overall revenue and approximately 32%, 86% and 51% of our CAG, LPD, and Water revenues, respectively, were attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. Although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business, we may not be able to successfully promote, market, import, export, sell, or distribute our products and services outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales and operations, including, but not limited to, disruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain; fluctuations in oil prices; increased border protection and restriction on travel; the differing product and service needs of foreign customers; difficulties in building, staffing, and managing foreign operations (including a geographically dispersed workforce); differing protection of intellectual property; trade protection measures, quotas, embargoes, import/export restrictions, capital controls, tariffs, duties, and regulatory and licensing requirements; natural and other disasters; public health issues (such as outbreaks, epidemics, or the prospect of a pandemic); ongoing instability or changes in a country&#8217;s or region&#8217;s regulatory, economic, or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; geopolitical crises, including terrorism, war, armed conflict or civil or military unrest (such as the current war between Russia and Ukraine); other unfavorable geopolitical conditions; security concerns; and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal \n\nstandards and practices, including business practices prohibited by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. \n\nIn addition, to market and sell many of our products outside the U.S., we are subject to product approval and registration requirements that often require us to provide confidential, proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies. There can be no assurance that the confidential, proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies to comply with product approval and registration requirements may not be accessed by unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen, which could negatively affect our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success. We also may forgo marketing and selling some of our products in certain foreign jurisdictions due to the risk of intellectual property theft, which could negatively affect our ability to expand our international operations and business. For more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services, refer to &#8220;Our success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation&#8221; above. \n\nFurther, prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period. \n\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation \n\nWe operate in many regions around the world where our businesses and the activities of our customers and suppliers could be disrupted by climate change. We are exposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in technology, market risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as harm to health and well-being) associated with climate change. These risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). \n\nPotential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires and other natural disasters, rising sea levels, and a rising heat index, any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; businesses. Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events could impact our suppliers, manufacturing locations, logistics, and/or customers in the short term. Such impacts include losses incurred as a result of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events. Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced access to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which could impact future product development. These risks could disrupt our operations and supply chain, which may result in increased costs. \n\nNew legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the environment. These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could result in our being subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, investments in developing data gathering and reporting systems, upgrade of facilities to meet new building codes, increased energy costs, and the redesign of utility systems, which could increase our operating costs. Our supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to us, which may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. \n\nA weak worldwide economy, or economic weakness in any significant geography, could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk \n\nA substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary industry. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing, as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations. Pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices. The ongoing impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, fear of a global economic downturn or recession and other economic factors, have increased economic uncertainty and caused economic slowdowns that may continue or recur. Economic weakness in any of our significant geographies could cause pet owners in those regions to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests, comply with a treatment plan or, even more fundamentally, continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests, and concerns about the economy may \n\ncause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems. These conditions, if they continue, could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth, of diagnostic products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nDemand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories, water utilities, and private certified laboratories that utilize our products. Availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products, and by users of our human diagnostic products and services. Economic weakness and the other factors described above have caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nA weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers, which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all. \n\nOur operations and reputation may be impaired if we, our products, or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection \n\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt, storage and use of information, including personal data, about our customers, pet owners, suppliers, and employees. We collect and use personal data in a variety of ways. We offer products and services that collect and use personal data, including veterinary practice management systems, online customer communication tools and services, VetConnect PLUS, and two-way integration technology. Some of these products and services rely on third-party providers for cloud storage. We also engage in e-commerce through various websites and collect contact and other personal data from our customers and website visitors. In addition, we transfer information, including personal data, among IDEXX, our subsidiaries and third parties with which we have commercial relations for business purposes. Our collection, transfer, protection, security, retention, storage, disclosure, sharing and use of personal data described above are subject to expanding and increasingly complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, these laws and regulations continue to develop and are subject to frequent revisions (and generally have become more stringent over time), are subject to differing interpretations, may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and could be deemed to be inconsistent with our current global privacy policy and data protection practices. \n\nWhile we maintain a program to monitor, assess, and comply with applicable global data privacy laws, compliance with these evolving requirements can be costly, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business or delay or impede the development and offering of innovative products and services. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal data can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators in the U.S. and abroad to expand or adopt more stringent regulations and laws. Examples of laws and regulations that have impacted and could, in the future, impact our business include: \n\n&#8226; The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), as well as any similar U.S. state laws that may apply to our business operations within a respective state and/or a U.S. federal privacy law that may be passed in the future, all of which may have conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. The CCPA contained certain exemptions for personal information of employees and job applicants, and personal information collected in a &#8220;business-to-business&#8221; context, each of which expired as of January 1, 2023, expanding compliance obligations under to the CCPA. \n\n&#8226; The European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) and similar requirements adopted by the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) following the UK&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) and the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) impose stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of individuals in the EEA and UK. Noncompliance could result in regulatory enforcement actions resulting in monetary penalties of up to the greater of &#8364;20 million or 4% of global annual revenues, private litigation, a suspension or termination of processing activities, reputational damage, and loss of customers. \n\n&#8226; The China Personal Information Protection Law, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, the South African Protection of Personal Information Act, the Amendments to the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information, and the New Zealand Privacy Act are examples of other non-U.S. personal data protection laws to which we are subject. Additional countries in which we operate are considering adopting or expanding laws and regulations regarding personal data. \n\nAn additional area of complexity concerns the restrictions on transfers of personal data from certain countries to others. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy \n\nShield Frameworks, calling into question data transfers carried out under the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (&#8220;SCCs&#8221;), which has created challenges for our transfer of personal data from the EEA, EU, and/or Switzerland to the U.S. and other third countries. Any transfers by us or our vendors of personal data are subject to potential regulatory scrutiny and may increase our exposure under the GDPR and similar laws which contain cross-border personal data transfer heightened requirements and restrictions. \n\nAny failure or perceived failure by us, the third parties with whom we work or our products and services to comply with all applicable privacy-related laws and regulations, as well as our contractual obligations, could result in damage to our reputation or legal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, or security of personal data or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, could damage our reputation and harm our business. \n\nFailure to meet environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) regulations, standards, or expectations or to achieve our ESG goals or targets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price \n\nU.S. and international regulators, as well as our investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters, including climate-related issues; diversity, equity, and inclusion; human capital matters; and responsible sourcing, human rights, and supply chain. Regulators in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are considering or have proposed or adopted various laws, directives or regulations regarding ESG matters, which include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Furthermore, our investors and other stakeholders have additional (and sometimes different) ESG expectations for companies such as IDEXX. Meeting these emerging and evolving regulations, standards and expectations will require us to make investments, incur compliance costs and create new practices, processes, and procedures. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable ESG regulations, or our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or product or service provider could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. \n\nGiven our commitment to ESG, we have publicly established certain ESG goals and targets. Our ability to achieve any ESG goal or target is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control and depend in part on third-party performance or data, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve them. Our failure to adequately update, accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals and targets on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community, special interest groups and enforcement authorities. \n\nFuture operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities \n\nThe nature of our global operations subjects us to local, state, regional and federal tax laws in jurisdictions around the world. Our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Additionally, tax rules governing cross-border activities are continually subject to modification as a result of coordinated actions by governments and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, including a global minimum tax rate of 15%, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting (&#8220;BEPS&#8221;) and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. The U.S. recently enacted new tax legislation which, among other changes, imposes a 15% minimum tax on the book income of certain corporations and 1% excise tax on stock buybacks by U.S. public companies. \n\nWhile we have taken, and may take further, actions intended to align our corporate structure and intercompany relationships with supporting our growth in international markets and maintaining operational and tax efficiency and continue to consider all of these developments within our overall tax strategy, changes in tax law in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate or have a presence may materially and adversely impact our income tax liability, provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and results of operation, and there can be no assurance that any actions we take to maintain operational and tax efficiency will effectively mitigate these impacts. Moreover, these actions may increase our operating costs, and if ineffectual, could increase our income tax liabilities and our global effective tax rate. \n\nOur income tax filings are subject to examination by various tax authorities, and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Significant judgment \n\nis required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. Any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination is made. If the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nStrengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar has a negative effect on our business \n\nWe are a global business, with 35% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022, attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the U.S. Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, and in particular the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Brazilian real, adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and sold internationally in local currencies, as compared to 23% for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 21% for the year ended December 31, 2020. A strengthening U.S. dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets. The accumulated impacts from any continued, longer-term growth in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding currency impact. \n\nOur foreign currency hedging activities (refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19. Hedging Instruments&#8221; in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements), which are designed to minimize and delay, but not to eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place. In addition, our hedging activities involve costs and risks, such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations. \n\nWe primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Australian dollar. Other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge. In certain cases, these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs. As we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year, the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longer-term appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies may be limited. Factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts, volatility of currency markets, and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. Since our hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility, they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. \n\nRestrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may increase our cost of borrowing and limit our activities \n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our Credit Facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the Credit Facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements, which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms. In addition, adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing, which could limit our ability to execute certain strategies and have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability. \n\nOur senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates. Should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes, the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. \n\nWe fund our operations, capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, amounts available under our Credit Facility and senior note financings. If we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability. \n\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates, including rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;), exposing us to interest rate risk. The recent rise in interest rates has increased our cost of borrowing. If interest rates were to continue to increase, our debt service obligations under our variable-rate Credit Facility would increase even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES \n\nFluctuations in our quarterly or annual results may cause our stock price to decline \n\nOur prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, and customer marketing and incentive programs; changes in the number and type of competitors and their product and service offerings; changes in our sales and distribution model; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall. \n\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid \n\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as other general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock rapidly and unexpectedly, in spite of our operating performance. Factors that may impact the market price of our common stock include the factors described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as: \n\n&#8226; Our stock repurchase program and changes in our capital structure or cost of capital, including the issuance of additional debt; \n\n&#8226; Public announcements (including the timing of these announcements) regarding our business, financial performance and prospects or new products or services, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us; \n\n&#8226; Trading activity in our stock, including portfolio transactions in our stock by us, our executive officers and directors, and significant stockholders; trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which we may be included, such as the S&#38;P 500 Index; trading activity related to our inclusion in, or removal from, any stock indices; and short interest in our common stock, which could be significant from time to time; \n\n&#8226; Investor perception of us and the industry and sectors in which we operate, including changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts; and whether or not we meet earnings estimates of securities analysts who follow us; and \n\n&#8226; General financial, domestic, international, economic, and market conditions, including overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity and credit markets, which may experience extreme volatility that, in some cases, is unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. \n\n"

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K . The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2020, and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020, is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and is incorporated by reference herein. \n\nWe have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the &#8220;Glossary of Terms and Selected Abbreviations.&#8221; \n\nDescription of Business Segments . We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information management-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary industry, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (&#8220;CAG&#8221;); water quality products (&#8220;Water&#8221;); and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and improve producer efficiency, which we refer to as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (&#8220;LPD&#8221;). Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products and services business (&#8220;OPTI Medical&#8221;) with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3. Revenue Recognition and Note 17. Segment Reporting&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories, and our geographic areas. \n\nThe following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business. \n\nCompanion Animal Group \n\nOur strategy is to provide veterinarians with the highest quality diagnostic information, software products and services, and medical evidence to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient and effective practice management. By doing so, we are able to build a mutually successful relationship with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets, loyal customers, staff efficiency, and expanding practice revenues. \n\nCAG Diagnostics. We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians&#8217; diverse needs through a variety of modalities including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient&#8217;s diagnostic results, which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight. \n\nOur diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Revenues related to capital placements of our in-clinic IDEXX VetLab suite of instruments and our SNAP Pro Analyzer are non-recurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once. Revenues from the associated IDEXX VetLab consumables, SNAP rapid assay test kits, reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our IDEXX VetLab instruments and our SNAP Pro Analyzer are recurring in nature, in that they are regularly purchased by our customers, typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services. Our recurring revenues, most prominently IDEXX VetLab consumables and rapid assay test kits, have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales. Therefore, the mix of recurring and non-recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins. \n\nDiagnostic Capital Revenue. Revenues related to the placement of the IDEXX VetLab suite of instruments are non-recurring in nature, in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle, but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes. During the early stage of an instrument&#8217;s life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. In the early stage of an instrument&#8217;s life cycle, placements are made primarily through sales transactions. As the demand for the product matures, an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions, sometimes referred to as \n\nvolume commitments, such as our IDEXX 360 program, or reagent rentals, in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a multi-year customer commitment to purchase recurring products and services. \n\nBelow is a table showing active installed base units of our premium diagnostic instruments as of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START (units in thousands) Installed Base Instrument December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Catalyst 63.1 56.6 49.7 Premium Hematology 43.1 38.2 34.6 SediVue 15.6 13.2 10.7 ##TABLE_END\n\nOur long-term success in the continuing growth of our CAG recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon: growing volumes at existing customers by increasing their utilization of existing and new test offerings, acquiring new customers, maintaining high customer loyalty and retention, and realizing modest annual price increases based on our differentiated products and the growing value of our diagnostic offering. We continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of real-time care testing workflows, which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit. Our latest generation of chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use, faster time to results, broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments. In addition, we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis. \n\nWith all of our instrument product lines, we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors&#8217; products based on time-to-result, ease-of-use, throughput, breadth of diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ability to handle compromised samples, analytical capability of diagnostics software, integration with the IVLS and VetConnect PLUS, client communications capabilities, education and training, and superior sales and customer service. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price. \n\nRecurring Diagnostic Revenue. Revenues from our IDEXX VetLab consumable products, our SNAP rapid assay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our CAG Diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature. For the year ended December 31, 2022, recurri ng diagnostic revenue, which is both highly durable and profitable, accounted for approximately 79% of our consolidated revenue. \n\nOur in-clinic diagnostic solutions, consisting of our IDEXX VetLab consumable products and SNAP rapid assay test kits, provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. Our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with board-certified veterinary specialists and pathologists, combined with the benefit of same-day or next-day turnaround times. \n\nWe derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in IDEXX VetLab instruments, and the multi-year consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument. Our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing IDEXX VetLab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables. Utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample. Our strategy is to increase both drivers. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes, as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians. \n\nOur in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include SNAP rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate these tests from those of other in-clinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed third-party research, as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once, including the ability to utilize our SNAP Pro Analyzer. We further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and \n\nmarketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnosti c testing. \n\nThe prevalence of in-clinic testing, as opposed to outside reference laboratories such as IDEXX Reference Laboratories, may vary by region. We attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive in-clinic offerings primarily on the basis of a differentiated test menu, technology employed, quality, turnaround time, customer service and tools such as VetConnect PLUS that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our in-clinic offerings. \n\nProfitability in our lab business is supported, in part, by our expanding business scale globally. Profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve operational efficiencies. When possible, we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries, expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint. New laboratories may operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference laboratories generally may have a negative effect on our operating margin. \n\nRecurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased testing volumes with existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers, net of customer losses. We believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our in-clinic diagnostic modalities. In recent years, recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions, customer list acquisitions, the opening of new reference laboratories, including laboratories that are co-located with large practice customers, and as a result of our up-front customer loyalty programs and our volume commitment programs. Our up-front customer loyalty programs are associated with customer acquisitions and retention and provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering multi-year contractual agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services, including reference laboratory services. Our volume commitment programs, such as IDEXX 360, provide customers with a free or discounted instrument or system upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. \n\nVeterinary Software, Services and Diagnostic Imaging Systems . Our portfolio of practice management offerings is designed to serve the full range of customers primarily within the North American, Australian, New Zealand, and European regions. Cornerstone, ezyVet, Animana, IDEXX Neo, and DVMAX practice management systems provide superior integrated information solutions, backed by exceptional customer support and education. These practice management systems allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice&#8217;s business objectives, including a quality client experience, staff efficiency and practice effectiveness and profitability. We market Cornerstone, ezyVet, IDEXX Neo, and DVMAX practice management systems to customers primarily in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. We market our Animana offering to customers primarily throughout Europe. \n\nAnimana, ezyVet, and IDEXX Neo practice management systems are subscription-based SaaS offerings designed to provide flexible pricing and a durable, recurring revenue stream, while utilizing cloud technology instead of a client server platform. While we continue to support our licensed-based Cornerstone and DVMAX software, we are growing our installed base of subscription-based practice management offerings for new customers of IDEXX practice management systems. We believe that once established, this subscription-based model will provide higher profitability as compared to the historical license-based placements. Our Cornerstone and DVMAX customer base continues to be an important driver of growth through enhanced diagnostic integrations and high value add-on subscription services, such as Pet Health Network Pro, Petly Plans, and credit card processing, and we continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience of all of our license-based software offerings. We also offer rVetLink, a comprehensive referral management solution for specialty care hospitals that streamlines the referral process between primary care and specialty care veterinarians. rVetLink&#8217;s cloud technology integrates with major specialty hospital management systems, including Cornerstone Software and DVMAX Software. \n\nWe differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality, ease of use, and embedded integration with in-clinic IDEXX VetLab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results. Our client communication services create more meaningful pet owner experiences through personalized communication. With our SmartFlow and Vet Radar cloud technology, we are able to improve overall patient management through coordination and tracking of every step in a patient workflow. Pet Health Network Pro online client communication and education service complements the entire IDEXX \n\nproduct offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before, during and after the visit, thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits. \n\nOur diagnostic imaging systems offer a convenient radiographic solution that provides superior image quality and the ability to share images with clients virtually anywhere. IDEXX imaging software enables enhanced diagnostic features and streamlined integration with our other products and services. Our digital radiography systems, enables low-dose radiation image capture without sacrificing clear, high-quality diagnostic images, reducing the risk posed by excess radiation exposure for veterinary professionals. Placements of imaging systems are important to the growth of revenue streams that are recurring in nature, including extended maintenance agreements and IDEXX Web PACS, which is our cloud-based SaaS offering for viewing, accessing, storing, and sharing multi-modality diagnostic images. We derive relatively higher margins from our subscription-based products. IDEXX Web PACS is integrated with Cornerstone, ezyVet, IDEXX Neo, DVMAX, and IDEXX VetConnect PLUS to provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging results alongside patient diagnostic results from any internet connected device. \n\nWater \n\nOur strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices, including drinking water supplies, with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our customers primarily consist of water utilities, government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support. We expect that future growth in this business will be partially dependent on our ability to increase international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers&#8217; testing protocols. As a result, we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in Europe. Further, we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition. \n\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy \n\nWe develop, manufacture, market, and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions, and have active research and development and in-licensing programs in this area. Our strategy is to offer differentiated tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers&#8217; disease, reproductive, and herd health and production management programs. Our Alertys Ruminant Pregnancy Test, Rapid Visual Pregnancy Test and Alertys On-Farm Pregnancy Test for cattle can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding. These tests provide a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples. \n\nDisease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. In addition, increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products. As result, the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate. \n\nOur strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance. The manufacture of these testing products leverages the SNAP platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business, which also leverages the SNAP platform. The dairy SNAP products incorporate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection. \n\nOther \n\nOPTI Medical . Our strategy in the OPTI Medical business for the human market is to develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers, and related consumable products for the medical point-of-care diagnostics sector worldwide, with a focus on small to mid-sized hospitals. We seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, convenience, international distribution and service and instrument reliability. Similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. During the early stage of an instrument&#8217;s life cycle, relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later \n\nstages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments. \n\nDuring 2020, we introduced the OPTI SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test kit for human COVID-19 testing. A significant portion of the 2021 growth in our OPTI Medical business was from revenue generated from the test kits and related laboratory services. The amount of revenue from this product decreased in 2022, with less demand for testing. We expect revenues from COVID-19 related testing products and services to be inconsequential in 2023. \n\nOur facility in Roswell, Georgia develops and manufactures the OPTI product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte requirements of certain CAG products. We leverage this facility&#8217;s know-how, intellectual property, and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the VetStat and Catalyst platforms for veterinary applications, while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements. \n\nWe believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRefer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3. Revenue Recognition&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue. \n\nWe enter into contracts where customers purchase combinations of IDEXX products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires judgment. We determine the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments, we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized. We evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts. \n\nWe allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each obligation. We utilize the observable standalone selling price when available, which represents the price charged for the promised product or service when sold separately. When standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable, we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including, but not limited to, the cost plus a margin approach. \n\nOur up-front loyalty programs provide customers with incentives in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services. If a customer breaches their agreement, they are required to refund all or a portion of the up-front cash or IDEXX Points, or make other repayments, remedial actions, or both. Up-front incentives to customers in the form of cash or IDEXX Points are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as customer acquisition costs within other current and long-term assets, which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement. If these up-front incentives are \n\nsubsequently utilized to purchase instruments, we allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases less up-front incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multi-year agreements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer contract, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately $1.1 million at December 31, 2022. \n\nOur volume commitment programs, such as our IDEXX 360 program, provide customers with free or discounted instruments or systems upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. We allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer, which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer. Our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract asset within other current and long-term assets. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for products and services over the term of the contract. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multi-year agreements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer contract, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced contract assets and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2022. \n\nOur instrument rebate programs require an instrument purchase and provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the program. We account for the customer&#8217;s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the program. Total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional. We allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations, including the customer&#8217;s right to earn rebates on future purchases, which is deferred and subsequently recognized upon the purchase of products and services, partly offsetting rebates as they are earned. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer rebates related to these multi-year agreements. Differences between estimated and actual customer rebates may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer contract, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately $2.8 million at December 31, 2022. \n\nFuture market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods. Additionally, certain customer programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases, customer rebates and other incentive payments, and price adjustments related to multi-year agreements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition as described above. \n\nValuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nA significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value. If a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When significant, we typically utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be separately identified and recognized. \n\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. An impairment charge is recorded for the amount, if any, by which the carrying \n\namount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our CAG operating segment, our Water and LPD operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008. A substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business, included in our &#8220;Other Segment,&#8221; is associated with intellectual property that has been, or may be, licensed to third parties. Realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products, which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments. \n\nAs part of our goodwill testing process, we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit. Examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include: the results of the most recent impairment test; the competitive environment; the regulatory environment; the effects natural disasters; anticipated changes in product, supply chain, or labor costs; revenue and profitability trends and expectations; the consistency of cash flows; and current and long-range financial forecasts. The long-range financial forecasts of the reporting units, which are based upon management&#8217;s long-term view of our markets, are used by senior management and the Board of Directors to evaluate operating performance. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment for all of our reporting units, except for Pharmaceutical Activities, and concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of those reporting units is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We maintain approximately $6.5 million of goodwill associated with Pharmaceutical Activities, which comprises pharmaceutical intellectual property, out-licensing arrangements, and certain retained drug delivery technologies from which we earn royalty revenue. For our Pharmaceutical Activities, we performed a quantitative assessment and concluded that the estimated fair value approximates the carrying amount of the reporting unit. We estimated the fair value of the Pharmaceutical Activities using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows, making assumptions about future cash flows and discount rates. These is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain revenues from our remaining Pharmaceutical Activities. No goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nA prolonged economic downturn in the U.S. or internationally resulting in lower long-term growth rates and reduced long-term profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur, and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test, in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill. An impairment of goodwill would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. \n\nWe also assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets, other than goodwill, based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group. The asset group is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows associated with the intangible asset are largely independent. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If the net carrying value of the asset group exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss to adjust the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. If necessary, we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and apply a risk-adjusted discount rate. We had no impairments of our intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amount of impairment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was immaterial. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. \n\nWe assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. \n\nFor those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that \n\njurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made. \n\nOur net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future, an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged, as appropriate, to income in the period such determination was made. \n\nWe periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. \n\nWe record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. For positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail, we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. If our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change, resolution or expiration occurs. Our net liability for uncertain tax positions was $25.8 million as of December 31, 2022, and $25.5 million as of December 31, 2021, which includes estimated interest expense and penalties. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14. Income Taxes&#8221; in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nRefer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (v) and (w)&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements adopted and not adopted. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND TRENDS \n\nEffects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations \n\nCAG Trends . Global trends in companion animal healthcare, including growth in demand for clinical services, continue to support solid growth for companion animal diagnostic products and services across regions. In the U.S., average diagnostics revenue per practice grew 6.9% on a same-store basis during 2022, faster than 5.1% growth in overall clinic revenues. U.S. same-store clinical visits at veterinary practices declined 2.3% in 2022, reflecting impacts this year from reductions in veterinary clinic capacity levels and comparison to high prior-year visit levels. Growth for pet healthcare including diagnostics remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels reflecting compound annual growth of 2.9% in clinical visits and 11.2% in same-store diagnostics revenues for the U.S. compared to 2019. \n\nSupply Chain and Logistics Challenges . We believe that building and maintaining a well-managed and disciplined infrastructure have helped minimize impacts of the current supply chain constraints, including product and component availability issues, logistics challenges, including extended shipping periods and delays, and inflationary pressures that are currently occurring worldwide. Our proactive approach to managing our operational processes, including forward planning with a focus on working closely with our suppliers and logistics partners, has enabled us to maintain continued high levels of product and service availability and customer service. We continue to monitor these supply chain and logistics challenges, including potential fuel rationing and shortages, and have implemented mitigation strategies to adjust for, among other things, delayed shipments of products and components. Although we expect these challenges to continue during 2023, we believe we are well-positioned to enable sustained high growth in our businesses going forward and to effectively manage the impacts of potentially relatively higher costs in certain areas to support these growth plans. However, there can be no assurance as to the duration or severity of the supply chain and logistics challenges or the effectiveness of our mitigating activities. \n\nWar in Ukraine / Russia Operations . Our operations in the Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine region are limited, with no manufacturing or significant supply arrangements. After significantly scaling back our operations in Russia in the first quarter of 2022, including suspending sales of veterinary diagnostic equipment; promotional, marketing, and hiring activities; and new business development and related investments, we decided in June 2022 to wind down and liquidate our sole Russian subsidiary, as well as our direct Russian operations, which consisted of marketing and selling diagnostic products for veterinary clinics in Russia. We anticipate that only a limited number of our products, which are important for human or animal healthcare, will continue to be sold in Russia pursuant to ongoing third-party distribution agreements. Some of our products are also sold in Belarus pursuant to ongoing third-party distribution agreements. Historical revenues from the Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine region have been less than 1% of our total consolidated revenue. \n\nDistributor Purchasing and Inventories . When selling our products through distributors, changes in distributors&#8217; inventory levels can impact our reported sales, and these changes may be affected by many factors, which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices, which are the end users. If during the current year, distributors&#8217; inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors&#8217; inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. Conversely, if during the current year, distributors&#8217; inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors&#8217; inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. \n\nIn certain countries, we sell our products through third-party distributors and may be unable to obtain data for sales to end users. We do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors&#8217; inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates. Refer to &#8220;Part I, Item 1. Business, Marketing and Distribution&#8221; included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding distribution channels. \n\nCurrency Impact . For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and sold internationally in local currencies, as compared to 23% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 21% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in U.S. dollars and sold internationally, and a weakening of the U.S. dollar has the opposite effect. Similarly, to the extent that the U.S. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure. Additionally, our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. denominated revenues. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding currency impact. Our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings, including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Refer to &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding tax impacts. \n\nEffects of Economic Conditions . Demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment, including slow economic growth, high unemployment, and credit availability. Negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending, resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics. Unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments, diagnostic imaging, and practice management systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians. Additionally, economic turmoil, fears of a global economic downturn or recession, and inflationary pressure can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services. In the U.S., we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our CAG customers. Although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to short-term impacts such as weather, which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period, we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful long-term representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the U.S., providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services. \n\nEconomic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our Water and LPD business customers. Water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction. Testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought. In addition, fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services. \n\nWe believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our customers partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates. \n\nEffects of Patent Expiration . Although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2022, and several that are expected to expire in 2023 and beyond, the expiration of these patents or licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as described in &#8220;Part I, Item 1. Business, Patents and Licenses.&#8221; \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures . The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth, and references in this analysis and discussion to &#8220;revenue,&#8221; &#8220;revenues&#8221; or &#8220;revenue growth&#8221; are references to &#8220;organic revenue growth.&#8221; Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the current year, as compared to the same period for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain business acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers. \n\nWe exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management&#8217;s control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period. \n\nWe also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period, and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction, and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends. We consider acquisitions to be a business when all three elements of inputs, processes and outputs are present, consistent with ASU 2017-01, &#8220; Business Combinations: (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business. &#8221; In a business combination, if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, we do not consider these assets to be a business. A typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition, which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business, such as employees or infrastructure. We believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth. \n\nWe also use Adjusted EBITDA, gross debt, net debt, gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures that should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, financial measures presented according to U.S. GAAP. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. \n\nComparisons to Prior Periods .

The increase in organic revenue reflects higher realized prices and continued demand for companion animal diagnostics globally, supported by higher CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, primarily in the U.S. Increases in our subscription-based veterinary software and diagnostic imaging services also contributed to higher revenue for the year. The higher revenue in our Water business was primarily due to the benefit of price increases and higher testing volumes. The decline in our LPD business was primarily due to lower demand in the first half of the year for swine testing in China, compared to high prior year levels. The decrease in Other revenue reflects lower sales of OPTI COVID-19 PCR testing products. The impact of currency movements decreased total revenue growth by 3.4%, while the impact of acquisitions increased total revenue growth by 0.7%. \n\nThe following table presents our total Company results of operations: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, Change \n\nTotal Company - Results of Operations \n\n(dollars in thousands) \n\n2022 Percent of Revenue 2021 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Revenues $ 3,367,324 &#160; $ 3,215,360 $ 151,964 4.7 % Cost of revenue 1,362,986 &#160; 1,325,928 37,058 2.8 % Gross profit 2,004,338 59.5 % 1,889,432 58.8 % 114,906 6.1 % Operating Expenses: Sales and marketing 524,505 15.6 % 486,735 15.1 % 37,770 7.8 % General and administrative 326,248 9.7 % 309,660 9.6 % 16,588 5.4 % Research and development 254,820 7.6 % 161,009 5.0 % 93,811 58.3 % Total operating expenses 1,105,573 32.8 % 957,404 29.8 % 148,169 15.5 % Income from operations $ 898,765 26.7 % $ 932,028 29.0 % $ (33,263) (3.6) % ##TABLE_END\n\nGross Profit . Gross profit increased due to higher sales volumes and a 70 basis point increase in the gross profit margin. The impact from foreign currency movements increased the gross profit margin by approximately 50 basis points, primarily from the impact of hedge gains in the current year as compared to hedge losses in the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, the increase in the gross margin was primarily due to net price gains, improved software services gross margins, and the benefit of our reference laboratory productivity initiatives. These increases were partially offset by higher freight and distribution costs; higher service costs, including increases in labor and facility costs; and higher product costs. \n\nOperating Expenses . Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related and travel costs, including investments in our global commercial capability. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs, increase in allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, and increases in amortization and depreciation expense related to business acquisitions and capital investments. General and administrative expense increases were partially offset by a comparative decrease due to acquisition-related costs incurred in the prior year. Research and development expense increased primarily due to discrete investments for the acquisition of rights to use certain licensed technology under intellectual property licensing arrangements, project costs, and higher personnel-related costs. The overall change in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses growth by approximately 2%. \n\nCompanion Animal Group &#160; \n\nThe following table presents revenue by product and service category for CAG: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, \n\nNet Revenue \n\n(dollars in thousands) \n\n2022 2021 Dollar Change Reported Revenue Growth (1) \n\nPercentage Change from Currency Percentage Change from Acquisitions Organic Revenue Growth (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue: $ 2,660,280 $ 2,534,562 $ 125,718 5.0 % (3.4 %) 0.1 % 8.2 % IDEXX VetLab consumables 1,057,236 1,006,781 50,455 5.0 % (4.3 %) &#8212; 9.3 % Rapid assay products 313,667 296,852 16,815 5.7 % (1.7 %) &#8212; 7.3 % Reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services 1,178,113 1,123,656 54,457 4.8 % (2.9 %) 0.3 % 7.4 % CAG Diagnostics services and accessories 111,264 107,273 3,991 3.7 % (4.5 %) &#8212; 8.2 % CAG Diagnostics capital - instruments 147,326 149,140 (1,814) (1.2 %) (4.7 %) &#8212; 3.5 % Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems 251,187 206,258 44,929 21.8 % (1.0 %) 7.9 % 14.9 % Net CAG revenue $ 3,058,793 $ 2,889,960 $ 168,833 5.8 % (3.3 %) 0.7 % 8.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Reported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to rounding. \n\nCAG Diagnostics Recurring Revenue . The increase in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue was primarily due to higher realized prices and increased volumes in IDEXX VetLab consumables, reference laboratory diagnostic services, and, to a lesser extent, rapid assay products. The impact of foreign currency movements decreased CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth by 3.4% . \n\nThe increase in IDEXX VetLab consumables revenue was primarily due to higher price realization and higher sales volumes, primarily of our Catalyst consumables and, to a lesser extent, ProCyte consumables. These volume increases were supported by the expansion of our installed base of instruments, our expanded menu of available tests in certain regions, and high customer retention levels. The impact of currency movements decreased revenue growth by 4.3%. \n\nThe increase in rapid assay revenue resulted primarily from higher price realization and higher clinic testing levels, primarily from SNAP 4Dx Plus. The impact of currency movements decreased revenue growth by 1.7%. \n\nThe increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to higher testing volumes and price realization in our U.S. labs. Growth in other regions was primarily due to higher price realization, partially offset by moderately lower international volumes compared to strong prior period demand levels. Acquisitions increased revenue growth by 0.3%. The impact of currency movements decreased revenue growth by 2.9%. \n\nCAG Diagnostics services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments. \n\nCAG Diagnostics Capital &#8211; Instrument Revenue . The impact of currency movements decreased revenue growth by 4.7%. Excluding the impact of currency, t he growth in instrument revenue was primarily due to higher premium instrument placements, primarily of the ProCyte One analyzer, to support increased diagnostic testing. \n\nVeterinary Software, Services, and Diagnostic Imaging Systems Revenue . The acquired business increased revenue growth by 7.9%. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, the increase in veterinary software and services revenue was primarily due to higher realized prices on service offerings and higher subscription-based service revenue supported by the expansion in our active installed base. The increase in our diagnostic imaging systems revenue was primarily due to increases in our active installed base resulting in higher service revenue, as well as higher instrument and equipment placements and higher realized prices. \n\nThe following table presents the CAG segment results of operations: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, Change \n\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands) \n\n2022 Percent of Revenue 2021 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Revenues $ 3,058,793 $ 2,889,960 $ 168,833 5.8 % Cost of revenue 1,252,216 1,206,156 46,060 3.8 % Gross profit 1,806,577 59.1 % 1,683,804 58.3 % 122,773 7.3 % Operating Expenses: Sales and marketing 480,655 15.7 % 444,694 15.4 % 35,961 8.1 % General and administrative 288,746 9.4 % 274,470 9.5 % 14,276 5.2 % Research and development 236,227 7.7 % 140,618 4.9 % 95,609 68.0 % Total operating expenses 1,005,628 32.9 % 859,782 29.8 % 145,846 17.0 % Income from operations $ 800,949 26.2 % $ 824,022 28.5 % $ (23,073) (2.8) % ##TABLE_END\n\nGross Profit . Gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volumes, as well as an 80 basis point increase in the gross profit margin. The increase in the gross profit margin was primarily due to recurring revenue net price gains, improved software services gross margins, and the benefit of our reference laboratory productivity initiatives. These increases were partially offset by higher freight and distribution costs, higher product costs, and higher service costs, including increases in labor and facility costs. The impact from foreign currency movements increased the gross profit margin by approximately 30 basis points, primarily from the impact of hedge gains in the current year as compared to hedge losses in the prior year. \n\nOperating Expenses . Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related and travel costs, including investments in our global commercial capability. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs, increases in amortization and depreciation expense related to business acquisitions and capital investments, and an increase in allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. General and administrative expense increases were partially offset by a comparative decrease due to acquisition-related costs incurred in the prior year. Research and development expense increased primarily due to discrete investments for the acquisition of rights to use certain licensed technology under intellectual property licensing arrangements, project costs, and higher personnel-related costs. The overall change in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses growth by approximately 2%. \n\nWater \n\nThe following table presents the Water segment results of operations: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, Change \n\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands) \n\n2022 Percent of Revenue 2021 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Revenues $ 155,720 $ 146,505 $ 9,215 6.3 % Cost of revenue 45,861 45,561 300 0.7 % Gross profit 109,859 70.5 % 100,944 68.9 % 8,915 8.8 % Operating Expenses: Sales and marketing 18,564 11.9 % 17,814 12.2 % 750 4.2 % General and administrative 14,353 9.2 % 13,442 9.2 % 911 6.8 % Research and development 4,423 2.8 % 4,244 2.9 % 179 4.2 % Total operating expenses 37,340 24.0 % 35,500 24.2 % 1,840 5.2 % Income from operations $ 72,519 46.6 % $ 65,444 44.7 % $ 7,075 10.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue . The increase in our Water business was due to higher realized prices and testing volumes, primarily in our Colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and E. coli testing. The impact of currency movements decreased revenue growth by 4.0%. The impact of an acquisition completed during the third quarter of 2022 increased revenue growth by 0.5%. \n\nGross Profit . Gross profit for Water increased due to higher sales volumes and a 160 basis point increase in the gross profit margin, which reflected a 210 basis point increase due to foreign currency movements, primarily from the impact of hedge gains in the current year compared to hedge losses in the prior year. Decreases in the gross profit margin were primarily due to higher product costs and higher distribution and freight costs, partially offset by higher realized prices. \n\nOperating Expenses . Sales and marketing expense increased p rimarily due to higher personnel-related and travel costs. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher third-party service costs, including acquisition-related costs, personnel-related costs, and allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. Research and development expense increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs. The overall change in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses growth by approximately 2%. \n\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy \n\nThe following table presents the LPD segment results of operations: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, Change \n\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands) \n\n2022 Percent of Revenue 2021 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Revenues $ 122,607 $ 135,887 $ (13,280) (9.8 %) Cost of revenue 49,606 54,323 (4,717) (8.7 %) Gross profit 73,001 59.5 % 81,564 60.0 % (8,563) (10.5 %) Operating Expenses: Sales and marketing 23,491 19.2 % 21,681 16.0 % 1,810 8.3 % General and administrative 17,119 14.0 % 17,606 13.0 % (487) (2.8 %) Research and development 12,582 10.3 % 13,641 10.0 % (1,059) (7.8 %) Total operating expenses 53,192 43.4 % 52,928 39.0 % 264 0.5 % Income from operations $ 19,809 16.2 % $ 28,636 21.1 % $ (8,827) (30.8 %) ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue . The unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements decreased revenue growth by 5.8%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the decline in revenue was primarily due to lower demand for diagnostic testing in China. Beginning during the second quarter of 2021 and continuing through the first half of 2022, we experienced lower livestock testing volumes in China, as changes in disease management approaches , low pork prices, and changes in government requirements related to the live animal imports and livestock infectious disease programs impacted testing volumes, in comparison to high prior-year demand for African Swine Fever testing. These declines were moderated during the second half of 2022, with modest volume increases in our swine testing market in China compared to low prior year levels. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher herd health screening in other Asia Pacific markets and higher price gains. \n\nGross Profit . The decrease in LPD gross profit was primarily due to lower sales volumes and a 50 basis point d ecrease in the gross profit margin. The decrease in the gross profit margin is primarily due to higher freight and distribution costs, investments in our bovine laboratory services, the unfavorable overall mix impacts largely from lower African Swine Fever testing, and higher product costs. The decrease in the gross profit margin was partially offset by the impac t from foreign currency movements, which increased the gross profit margin by approximately 360 basis points, primarily from the impact of hedge gains in the current year compared to hedge losses in the prior year. \n\nOperating Expenses . Sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to increases in personnel-related and travel costs. General and administrative decreased primarily due to lower personnel-related costs. Research and development expenses decreased primarily due to lower personnel-related costs. The overall change in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses growth by approximately 4%. \n\nOther \n\nThe following table presents the Other results of operations: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, Change \n\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands) \n\n2022 Percent of Revenue 2021 Percent of Revenue Amount Percentage &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Revenues $ 30,204 $ 43,008 $ (12,804) (29.8 %) Cost of revenue 15,303 19,888 (4,585) (23.1 %) Gross profit 14,901 49.3 % 23,120 53.8 % (8,219) (35.5 %) Operating Expenses: Sales and marketing 1,795 5.9 % 2,546 5.9 % (751) (29.5 %) General and administrative 6,030 20.0 % 4,142 9.6 % 1,888 45.6 % Research and development 1,588 5.3 % 2,506 5.8 % (918) (36.6 %) Total operating expenses 9,413 31.2 % 9,194 21.4 % 219 2.4 % Income from operations $ 5,488 18.2 % $ 13,926 32.4 % $ (8,438) (60.6 %) ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue . The decrease in Other revenue was primarily due to lower sales of OPTI COVID-19 PCR testing products and services in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, lower OPTI Medical consumables revenue internationally. The impact of currency movements increased revenues by 0.2%. \n\nGross Profit . Gross profit decreased due to lower sales volume and a 450 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin. The decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily due to unfavorable product mix with lower OPTI Medical consumables and higher freight, distribution, and product costs, partially offset by lower service costs associated with lower disease testing services. The overall change in foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on gross profit. \n\nOperating Expenses . &#160; Sales and marketing expense decreased primarily due to lower personnel-related costs. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions, as compared to the prior year, as well as higher allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. Foreign exchange losses on settlements for all operating segments are reported within our Other segment. Research and development expense decreased primarily due to lower project costs compared to investments in the development of infectious disease tests during the prior year. \n\nNon-Operating Items \n\nInterest Expense . Interest expense was $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $29.8 million for the prior year. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher average debt levels. \n\nOur effective income tax rate was 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by decreases in tax benefits related to share-based compensation and higher taxes on international income. Our projected effective tax rate for 2023 is approximately 22%. This projected 1% increase in the effective tax rate, over the full year 2022 effective tax rate, is primarily due to lower estimated tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nWe fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, proceeds from long-term senior note financings, and amounts available under our Credit Facility. We generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our companion animal veterinary, livestock, poultry, dairy, and water products and services, consulting services, and other various systems and services. Our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees, inventory and supplies, taxes, research and development, capital expenditures, rents, occupancy-related charges, interest expense, and business acquisitions. At December 31, 2022, we had $112.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $144.5 million on December 31, 2021. Working capital, including our Credit Facility, totaled negative $134.3 million at December 31, 2022, as compared to $192.1 million at December 31, 2021. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we had a remaining borrowing availability of $669.5 million under our $1.25 billion Credit Facility with $579.0 million outstanding borrowing under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under our Credit Facility is reduced by $1.5 million for outstanding letters of credit. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings to fund our growth objectives. We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months. We believe that these resources, coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing, will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future. We may enter into new financing arrangements or refinance or retire existing debt in the future depending on market conditions. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to raise capital in the U.S. through the incurrence of debt or equity issuances, which we may not be able to complete on favorable terms or at all. In addition, these alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings. \n\nWe manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash and cash equivalents are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S. \n\nThe following table presents cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically, and by our foreign subsidiaries: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, \n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\n(in thousands) \n\n2022 2021 &#160; &#160; U.S. $ 16,112 $ 2,632 Foreign 96,434 141,822 Total $ 112,546 $ 144,454 &#160; &#160; Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in U.S. dollars by our foreign subsidiaries $ 6,647 $ 6,245 ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, more than 99% of the cash and cash equivalents held was as bank deposits. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, included approximately USD $2.9 million of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions, which limit our ability to transfer funds outside of the country in which they are held. The currency control restricted cash is generally available for use within the country where it is held. \n\nThe following table presents additional key information concerning working capital: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nDays sales outstanding (1) \n\n43.4 43.4 43.2 42.0 42.4 \n\nInventory turns (2) \n\n1.3 1.3 1.5 1.6 2.0 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter, the result of which is then multiplied by 91.25 days. \n\n(2) Inventory turns represent inventory-related cost of product revenue for the 12 months preceding each quarter-end divided by the average inventory balances at the beginning and end of each quarter. \n\nThe decrease in inventory turns over the current year was a result of larger inventory on-hand, as we have increased inventory to support demand and product availability, as well as new product launches. \n\nSources and Uses of Cash \n\nThe following table presents cash provided (used): \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Dollar Change &#160; &#160; Net cash provided by operating activities $ 542,984 $ 755,546 $ (212,562) Net cash used by investing activities (195,350) (292,967) 97,617 Net cash used by financing activities (370,936) (697,414) 326,478 Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash (8,606) (4,639) (3,967) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (31,908) $ (239,474) $ 207,566 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities . The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $212.6 million during 2022 as compared to 2021, was primarily due to the lower net income and changes in other assets and liabilities. During 2022, we entered into two discrete arrangements to license intellectual property for which we paid $65 million which was charged to research and development expense. We also had an increase in taxes paid during 2022, primarily due to changes imposed by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the relevant provision that requires U.S. research and development expenditures incurred after January 1, 2022, to be capitalized and amortized over a five-year period. \n\nThe following table presents cash flows (used) provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Dollar Change &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable $ (41,398) $ (33,141) $ (8,257) Inventories (121,731) (52,919) (68,812) Accounts payable 3,467 11,233 (7,766) Deferred revenue (11,019) (7,551) (3,468) Other assets and liabilities (102,849) (55,145) (47,704) Total change in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities $ (273,530) $ (137,523) $ (136,007) ##TABLE_END\n\nCash used due to changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in the prior year, increased approximately $136.0 million. Cash used for inventory in the current period, as compared to the prior period, was higher primarily due to planned inventory growth to support demand and product availability. The increase of cash used for other assets and liabilities was primarily due to lower non-cash operating expenses recorded as accrued liabilities, primarily for personnel-related costs, as compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by accrued research and development investments in the current year. \n\nWe have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned. \n\nInvesting Activities . &#160; Cash used by investing activities was $195.4 million during 2022 as compared to $293.0 million used during 2021. The decrease in cash used by investing activities during 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to the acquisition of ezyVet during the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by an acquisition of an intangible asset during the first quarter of 2022, an equity investment during the second quarter of 2022, and the acquisition of a water testing business in the third quarter of 2022, as well as the increase in purchases of property and equipment related to our new warehouse and manufacturing site expansion. \n\nOur total capital expenditure plan for 2023 is estimated to be approximately $180.0 million, which includes capital investments in manufacturing and operations facilities to support growth, as well as investments in customer-facing software. \n\nFinancing Activities . Cash used by financing activities was $370.9 million during 2022, as compared to $697.4 million used during 2021. The decrease in cash used by financing activities was due to a $432.0 million increase in borrowings under our Credit Facility, partially offset by $72.9 million in additional repurchases of our common stock in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year. Cash was also used to pay off our $75 million 2022 Series A Notes when due and payable on February 14, 2022. \n\nCash used to repurchase shares of our common s tock increased by $72.9 million during 2022 , as compared to 2021. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. We primarily fund our share repurchases with cash generated from operations, as well as from various capital market activities, including the committed available financing through our Credit Facility. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20. Repurchases of Common Stock&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our share repurchases. \n\nUnder the $1.25 billion Credit Facility, the $1.0 billion unsecured credit line matures on December 9, 2026 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. On October 20, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the term lenders thereunder provided us, as borrower, an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $250 million (the &#8220;Term Loan&#8221;). The Term Loan matures on October 20, 2025. The net proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay previously incurred revolver borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Term Loan is subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default as the borrowings previously incurred pursuant to the Credit Facility. The applicable interest rate for the Term Loan is consistent with our line of credit, and is calculated at a per annum rate equal to either (at our option) (1) a prime rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, (2) an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (3) an adjusted daily simple SOFR rate, plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, Debt&#8221; for additional information about our applicable interest rates on our Credit Facility. Under the Credit Facility, we also pay quarterly commitment fees ranging from 0.075% to 0.25%, based on our leverage ratio, on any unused commitment. \n\nUnder the Credit Facility, the net repayment and borrowing activity resulted in increased cash used of $432.0 million during 2022, as compared to 2021. At December 31, 2022, we had $329.0 million outstanding on our line of credit and a $250.0 million Term Loan, for a total of $579 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021, we had $73.5 million in outstanding under the Credit Facility. The general availability of funds under the Credit Facility was further reduced by $1.5 million for letters of credit that were issued primarily in connection with our workers' compensation policy at December 31, 2022 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2021. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, and certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation not to exceed 3.5-to-1. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default. \n\nIn February 2022, we paid off our $75 million 2022 Series A Notes with cash provided by operations and financing activity. On July 21, 2021, we repaid our $50 million 2021 Series A Notes in full with cash provided by operations. The aggregate principal amounts of our 2023 Series A Notes for $75 million will become due and payable on December 11, 2023. We anticipate paying off our 2023 Series A Notes when due with cash provided by borrowings under our Credit Facility and cash provided by operations. Should we elect to prepay any of our senior notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable Senior Note Agreements. Additionally, in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company, the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the Senior Note Agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes. \n\nThe obligations under the senior notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable Senior Note Agreements, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, \n\nbankruptcy and insolvency-related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under ERISA, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, and cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness. \n\nRefer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, Debt&#8221; for additional information about our Credit Facility, Senior Notes, and Senior Note Agreements. \n\nEffect of currency translation on cash . The net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. These changes will fluctuate each year as the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the value of the foreign currencies change. The value of a currency depends on many factors, including interest rates, and the issuing governments' debt levels and strength of economy. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements . We have no off-balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for letters of credit and third-party guarantees, as reflected in &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13 Debt&#8221; and &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note 16. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively. \n\nFinancial Covenant . The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, as defined in the Senior Note Agreements and Credit Facility, not to exceed 3.5-to-1. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Note Agreements. The following details our consolidated leverage ratio calculation: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) Twelve months ended Trailing 12 Months Adjusted EBITDA: December 31, 2022 &#160; Net income attributable to stockholders $ 679,089 Interest expense 39,858 Provision for income taxes 180,883 Depreciation and amortization 111,900 Acquisition-related expense 873 Share-based compensation expense 49,770 Extraordinary and other non-recurring non-cash charges &#8212; Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,062,373 &#160; &#160; (dollars in thousands) Twelve months ended Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio: December 31, 2022 &#160; Line of credit $ 579,000 Current and long-term portion of long-term debt 769,369 Total debt 1,348,369 Acquisition-related consideration payable 3,453 Financing leases 5 Deferred financing costs 407 Gross debt $ 1,352,234 Gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio 1.27 Cash and cash equivalents $ (112,546) Net debt $ 1,239,688 Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio 1.17 ##TABLE_END\n\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees \n\nFor more information regarding our commitments, contingencies and guarantees, refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.&#8221; \n\nFor more information on our future lease payments, refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8. Leases&#8221; for our minimum lease payment schedule. The expected timing of payments of our leases may be different in future years, depending on decisions to extend lease terms and/or enter into additional leases in the preceding years. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, current liabilities include $579.0 million outstanding borrowing on our Credit Facility and the current portion of long-term debt of $75.0 million recorded as current liabilities. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13. Debt for more information about our Credit Facility and for more information on our repayment of our Senior Notes. \n\nWe also have purchase obligations that include agreements and purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are contractually enforceable and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, pricing, and approximate timing of purchases. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $232.4 million in purchase obligations due in 2023. Our purchase obligations beyond 2023 are approximately $50.4 million. These purchase obligation amounts do not include amounts recorded in accounts payable as of December 31, 2022. The expected timing of payments of our purchase obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. \n\nAdditionally, we have agreements with third parties that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and, based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we did not record any liabilities for these obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and do not anticipate any future payments for these guarantees. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our remaining obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax resulting from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 is $27.0 million. Our prior overpayments continued to satisfy our installment obligations through 2022. In 2023, our installment obligation will exceed our remaining overpayment and we will be required to remit the balance due on the installment. Our final installment will be paid in 2025. For information on our unrecognized tax benefits, refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14. Income Taxes.&#8221; \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, we paid the $15.0 million milestone payment associated with an arrangement to license intellectual property, which was expensed in 2022. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nOur market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and effects of inflation. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the U.S. or in U.S. dollars, but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximatel y 21% o f our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and sold internationally in local currencies, as compared to 23% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency, except six of our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. \n\nOur foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components: 1) local currency revenues and expenses; 2) the impact of hedge contracts; and 3) intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary. \n\nThe following table presents the estimated foreign currency exchange impact on our revenues, operating profit, and diluted earnings per share for the current period and as compared to the respective prior-year period: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Revenue (decrease) increase $ (108,812) $ 46,001 &#160; $ 1,301 &#160; Operating profit (decrease) increase, excluding hedge activity and exchange impacts on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions $ (56,420) $ 28,557 $ 887 Hedge gains (losses) - current period 25,733 (7,121) 829 Exchange (losses) gains on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions - current period (3,408) (2,111) 699 Operating profit (decrease) increase - current period $ (34,095) $ 19,325 &#160; $ 2,415 &#160; Hedge losses (gains) - prior period 7,121 (829) (10,628) Exchange losses (gains) on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions - prior period 2,111 (699) 1,116 Operating profit (decrease) increase - as compared to prior period $ (24,863) $ 17,797 &#160; $ (7,097) Diluted earnings per share (decrease) increase - as compared to prior period $ (0.22) $ 0.16 &#160; $ (0.06) ##TABLE_END\n\nAt our current foreign exchange rate assumptions, we anticipate the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will have an unfavorable effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues, operating profit, and diluted earnings per share in the year ended December 31, 2023, by approximately $16 million, $25 million, and $0.23 per share, respectively. This unfavorable impact includes net year-over-year impacts of foreign currency hedging activity, which is expected to decrease total company operating profit by approximately $18 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.17 during the year ending December 31, 2023. The actual impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above. The above estimate assumes that the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at $1.06, the British pound at $1.19, the Canadian dollar at $0.73, and the Australian dollar at $0.68; and the Japanese yen at &#165;135, the Chinese renminbi at RMB 6.88, and the Brazilian real at R$5.30 to the U.S. dollar for the full year of 2023. \n\nThe foreign currency exchange impacts on our revenue and operating income will be different from our 2023 estimates if actual foreign exchange rates are different from our assumptions. Excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies, a 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce revenue by approximately $12 million and operating income by approximately $3 million to $4 million, net of hedge positions. \n\nThe primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. If a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. We primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months. \n\nOur subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreign-denominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures, including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19. Hedging Instruments&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding euro-denominated notes that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. \n\nOur foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended December 31, 2022. We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to, or less than, other significant transactions. As a result, no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year. Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle. \n\nWe enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk, with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure. We target to hedge approximately 75% to 85% of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Australian dollar. We have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge. The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled $258.2 million at December 31, 2022, and $286.7 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, we had $0.8 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related tax. For more information on our hedge agreements refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19. Hedging Instruments.&#8221; \n\nFor additional information, refer to &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors; Risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results and Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar has a negative effect on our business ,&#8221; and &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; \n\nInterest Rate Risk and Effects of Inflation \n\nWe have a Credit Facility with a syndicate of multinational banks, which matures on December 9, 2026, and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. Although the Credit Facility does not mature until December 9, 2026, all individual borrowings under the terms of the Credit Facility have a stated term between 1 and 180 days, including the $250 million Term Loan that matures on October 20, 2025. The variable rates are based on SOFR, with rolling maturities of 1 and 3 month increments. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $579.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, based on our gross leverage ratio, our borrowing costs under the Credit Facility were approximately 3.1%. Based on the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022, an increase in SOFR of 1% would increase interest expense by approximately $5.8 million on an annual basis. \n\nDuring 2022, we experienced inflationary pressure on our operating costs. During 2023, we expect to continue to face higher costs for labor, commodities, energy, and transportation, as well as increased prices from suppliers. We may not be able to offset these higher costs through productivity initiatives and price increases, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any price increases we may impose may lead to declines in sales volume or sector share, if competitors do not similarly adjust their prices, or customers refuse to purchase at the higher prices. \n\n"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The term &#8220;disclosure controls and procedures,&#8221; as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#8217;s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. \n\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: \n\n&#8226; Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; \n\n&#8226; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and \n\n&#8226; Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. \n\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that, at December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. \n\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nCertifications \n\nThe certifications with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the Company&#8217;s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n"

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nF-2 \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nCustomer Commitment Programs Revenue Recognition &#8211; Transaction Price \n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized revenue associated with instruments totaling $147.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, the majority of which related to sales under customer commitment programs. The Company enters into contracts with multiple performance obligations where customers purchase a combination of the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company offers customer incentives upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. These commitment programs provide customers with a free or discounted instrument or system upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services. Management determines the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration expected to be received in exchange for the transferred goods or services. \n\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to customer commitment programs revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures over management&#8217;s determination of the transaction price related to the customer commitment programs. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the determination of the transaction price related to the customer commitment programs. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management&#8217;s process for determining the transaction price related to the customer commitment programs, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management, and (iii) testing, on a sample basis, the transaction price determined by management by obtaining and inspecting source documents, including contracts, invoices, and cash receipts, where applicable. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nBoston, Massachusetts \n\nFebruary 16, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2002. \n\nF-3 \n\nIDEXX LABORATORIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) and with the requirements of Regulation S-X. \n\nThese statements include the accounts of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (&#8220;IDEXX,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;). We do not have any variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. \n\nWe have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout these financial statements in the &#8220;Glossary of Terms and Selected Abbreviations.&#8221; \n\nWe develop, manufacture, and distribute products and provide services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, dairy, and water testing industries. We also sell human medical point-of-care products and laboratory diagnostics. Our principal line of business, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (&#8220;CAG&#8221;) operating segment, provides diagnostic capabilities and information management solutions for the companion animal veterinary industry, as well as the biomedical research community. Our principal regions for these products and services are the North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan, but we also sell to customers and distributors in many other countries around the world. Our Water operating segment provides innovative testing solutions for the quality and safety of water principally in the U.S. and Europe, but we also sell to customers in many other countries around the world. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (&#8220;LPD&#8221;) operating segment provides diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and performs services that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve producer efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk. Our principal regions for these products and services are Europe, United States, China, Australia, and Brazil, but we also sell to customers in many other countries around the world. We also operate a smaller operating segment that is comprised of our human medical diagnostic products and services business (&#8220;OPTI Medical&#8221;). Financial information about our OPTI Medical operating segment is combined and presented with our out-licensing arrangements remaining from our pharmaceutical business in an &#8220;Other&#8221; category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. Refer to &#8220;Note 3. Revenue Recognition&#8221; for additional information regarding disaggregated revenue by segment, major product and service categories, and geographical areas. Refer to &#8220;Note 17. Segment Reporting&#8221; for additional information regarding our reportable operating segments. \n\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n(a) Estimates \n\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to reserves for accounts receivable and customer contract assets and lease receivables; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; inventory valuation; revenue recognition, including product returns and customer contracts with multiple performance obligations; share-based compensation; warranty reserves; self-insurance reserves; fair value measurements and loss contingencies. We accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. \n\n( b ) Cash and Cash Equivalents \n\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits, money market funds, and short-duration agency bonds and commercial paper as described above. There is no restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nF-9 \n\n(c) Inventories &#8211; Refer to Note 7 \n\n(d) Property and Equipment &#8211; Refer to Note 9 \n\n(e) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets &#8211; Refer to Note 11 \n\n(f) Warranty Reserves \n\nWe provide a standard twelve-month warranty on all diagnostic instruments sold. We recognize the cost of instrument warranties in cost of product revenue at the time revenue is recognized based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty period. Cost of product revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the portion of the aggregate installed base that is under warranty. Estimated warranty expense is based on a variety of inputs, including historical instrument performance in the customers&#8217; environments, historical and estimated costs incurred in servicing instruments and projected instrument reliability. Should actual service rates or costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The amount of warranty reserve during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was not material. \n\n(g) Income Taxes &#8211; Refer to Note 14 \n\n(h) Taxes Remitted to Governmental Authorities by IDEXX on Behalf of Customer \n\nWe calculate, collect from our customers, and remit to governmental authorities, sales, value-added, and excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities in connection with revenue-producing transactions with our customers. We report these taxes on a net basis and do not include these tax amounts in revenue or cost of product or service revenue. \n\n(i) Revenue Recognition &#8211; Refer to Note 3 \n\n&#160; \n\n(j) Research and Development Costs \n\nResearch and development costs, which consist of employee compensation and benefits, certain licensing agreements, materials, external consulting, and product development costs, are expensed as incurred. We evaluate our research and development costs for capitalization after the technological feasibility has been established for software and products containing software to be sold; however, no costs were capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Software developed to deliver hosted services to our customers has been designated as internal use, and we capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software designated for internal use based on three distinct stages of development. Refer to &#8220;Note 9. Property and Equipment, Net&#8221; for further information on internal use software. \n\n(k) Advertising Costs \n\nAdvertising costs, which are recognized as sales and marketing expense in the period in which they are incurred, were $ 5.0 million, $ 3.3 million, and $ 1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\n(l) Legal Costs \n\nLegal costs are considered period costs and, accordingly, are expensed in the year services are provided. \n\n(m) Share-Based Compensation &#8211; Refer to Note 5 \n\n(n) Leases &#8211; Refer to Note 8 \n\n(o) Earnings per Share &#8211; Refer to Note 15 \n\nF-10 \n\n(p) Foreign Currency \n\nThe functional currency of six of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities of our other foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency, are translated to the U.S. dollar using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated to the U.S. dollar using the exchange rate at the date which those elements are recognized, and where it is impractical to do so, an average exchange rate in effect during the period is used to translate those elements. Cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;). \n\nRevenues and expenses denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary&#8217;s functional currency are recorded at the current exchange rate when the transaction is recognized. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary&#8217;s functional currency are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. These foreign currency gains and losses are included in general and administrative expenses within our Other segment. We recognized aggregate foreign currency losses of $ 3.4 million, losses of $ 2.1 million, and gains of $ 0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\n(q) Hedging Instruments &#8211; Refer to Note 19 \n\n(r) Fair Value Measurements &#8211; Refer to Note 18 \n\n(s) Comprehensive Income \n\nWe report all changes in equity, including net income and transactions or other events and circumstances from non-owner sources during the period in which they are recognized. We have chosen to present comprehensive income, which encompasses net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, gains and losses on our net investment hedges, defined benefit plan adjustments, and the difference between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt and equity securities, and forward currency exchange contracts, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Refer to &#8220;Note 21. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income&#8221; for information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of each component of AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\n(t) Equity and Cost Methods of Accounting for Investments \n\nInvestments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control the entity, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Significant influence generally exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Equity investments in entities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence and whose securities do not have a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes for the identical investment of the same issuer should they occur. \n\nWe evaluate our investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our equity investments of $ 30.3 million and $ 5.3 million, respectively, are recorded at cost in other long-term assets. Refer to &#8220;Note 4. Acquisitions, Asset Purchases and Investments&#8221; for additional information regarding our acquisition of equity investments. \n\n(u) Concentrations of Risk \n\nFinancial Instruments . Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, contract assets, lease receivables, and derivatives. To mitigate such risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents, we place our cash with highly-rated financial institutions, in non-interest bearing accounts that are insured by the U.S. government and money market funds invested in government securities. To reduce credit risk with respect to accounts receivable, contract assets, and lease receivables, we routinely assess the financial strength of our most significant customers and monitor the amounts owed to us, taking appropriate action when necessary. As a result, we believe that accounts receivable, contract assets, and lease receivables credit risk exposure is limited. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses, but historically have not experienced any material losses related to an individual customer or group of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. \n\nF-11 \n\nTo mitigate concentration of credit risk with respect to derivatives we enter into transactions with highly-rated financial institutions, enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to our derivative transactions and frequently monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties. Our master netting arrangements reduce our exposure in that they permit outstanding receivables and payables with the counterparties to our derivative transactions to be offset in the event of default. We have not incurred such losses and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. \n\nInventory . If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of the inventory we need to sell our products, we could face cost increases or delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Many of the third parties that provide us with the instruments we sell, as well as certain components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products, are sole or single-source suppliers. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary or complex in nature, and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. \n\n(v) New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted \n\nWe adopted ASU 2016-13, &#8220;Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,&#8221; effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective transition method. This ASU amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments, including trade receivables and leased equipment. The amendment requires entities to consider a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses, which may result in earlier recognition of losses. We recorded a non-cash cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $ 1.8 million, net of $ 0.6 million of income taxes, on our opening consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2020. This adjustment, before the impact of income taxes, was comprised of $ 2.3 million related to our contract assets and sales-type leases, and $ 0.2 million related to accounts receivable. Refer to &#8220;Note 6. Credit Losses&#8221; for more information on our presentation of credit losses. \n\nEffective January 1, 2021, we adopted ASU 2019-12, &#8220;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.&#8221; The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and by updating accounting requirements around goodwill recognized for tax purposes and the allocation of current and deferred tax expense among legal entities, among other minor changes. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, &#8220;Leases (Topic 842); Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments.&#8221; ASU 2021-05 requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease if another lease classification (i.e., sales-type or direct financing) would result in recognition of a day-one loss. We elected to adopt this standard as of the third quarter of 2021, on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2021-05 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\n(w) New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, &#8220;Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,&#8221; which adds certain disclosure requirements for a buyer in a supplier finance program. The amendments require a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program&#8217;s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period, and associated roll-forward information. In interim reporting periods, the amount outstanding at the end of the period is required to be disclosed. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 on a retrospective basis, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the requirement to disclose roll-forward information, which is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, &#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities.&#8221; ASU 2021-08 is intended to improve comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination by providing consistent recognition guidance. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Adoption of the ASU 2021-08 should be applied prospectively. We do not expect this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nF-12 \n\nNOTE 3. REVENUE RECOGNITION \n\nOur revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to a customer. We exclude sales, use, value-added, and other taxes we collect on behalf of third parties from revenue. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer. To accurately present the consideration received in exchange for promised products or services, we apply the five-step model outlined below: \n\n1. Identification of a contract or agreement with a customer \n\n2. Identification of our performance obligations in the contract or agreement \n\n3. Determination of the transaction price \n\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations \n\n5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation \n\nWe enter into contracts where customers purchase combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts receivable, lease receivables, and contract assets as a result of revenue recognized in advance of billings, and contract liabilities or deferred revenue as a result of receiving consideration in advance of revenue recognition within our consolidated balance sheet. Our general payment terms range from 30 to 60 days, with exceptions in certain geographies. \n\nContracts may be amended to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. Contract modifications exist when the amendment either creates new, or changes existing, enforceable rights and obligations. A modification is considered to be a separate contract, and revenue is recognized prospectively, when the modification creates new performance obligations to deliver additional goods or services and the related increase in consideration approximates the standalone selling price for the additional goods or services. If a contract modification does not create a new performance obligation to deliver new goods and/or services but the goods and/or services to be delivered after the contract modification date are distinct from the goods and/or services delivered on or before the contract modification date, then this contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract, and we account for the goods and/or services to be delivered after the contract modification date prospectively. We account for a contract modification as if it were a part of the existing contract if the remaining goods or services are not distinct and, therefore, form part of a single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. The effect that these contract modifications have on the transaction price, and on our measure of progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue at the date of the contract modification, with the adjustment to revenue made on a cumulative catch-up basis. \n\nBelow is a listing of our major categories of revenue for our products and services. \n\nDiagnostic Products and Accessories . Diagnostic products and accessories revenues, including IDEXX VetLab &#174; consumables and accessories, rapid assay, LPD, Water, and OPTI testing products, are predominantly recognized and invoiced at the time of shipment, which is when the customer obtains control of the product based on legal title transfer and we have the right to payment. We also provide customers with certain consumables that are recognized upon utilization by the customer, which is when we have the right to payment and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer. Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue and cost of sales. As a practical expedient, we do not account for shipping activities as a separate performance obligation. \n\nLaboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services . Laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenues are recognized and invoiced when the laboratory diagnostic service is performed. \n\nInstruments, Software and Systems . CAG Diagnostics capital instruments, veterinary software, and diagnostic imaging systems revenues are recognized and invoiced when the customer obtains control of the products based on legal title transfer and we have the right to payment, which generally occurs at the time of installation and customer acceptance. Our instruments, software, and systems are often included in one of our significant customer programs, as further described below. For veterinary software systems that include multiple performance obligations, such as perpetual software licenses and computer hardware, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates of the price that we would charge the customer for each promised product or service if it were sold on a standalone basis. \n\nLease Revenue . Revenues from instrument rental agreements and reagent rental programs are recognized either as operating leases on a ratable basis over the term of the agreement or as sales-type leases at the time of installation and customer \n\nF-13 \n\nacceptance. Customers typically pay for the right to use instruments under rental agreements in equal monthly amounts over the term of the rental agreement. Our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables. These types of agreements include an embedded lease for the right to use our instruments. For some agreements, the customers are provided with the right to purchase the instrument at the end of the lease term. Lease revenues from these agreements are presented in product revenue on our consolidated income statement. Lease revenue was approximately $ 20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $ 20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, including both operating leases and sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases, for leases entered into after January 1, 2019, and ASC 840, Leases, for leases entered into prior to 2019. Refer to below for revenue recognition under our reagent rental programs. \n\nExtended Warranties and Post-Contract Support . CAG Diagnostics capital instruments and diagnostic imaging systems extended warranties typically provide customers with continued coverage for a period of one to five years beyond the first-year standard warranty. Customers can either pay in full for the extended warranty at the time of instrument or system purchase, or can be billed on a quarterly basis over the term of the contract. We recognize revenue associated with extended warranties over time on a ratable basis using a time-elapsed measure of performance over the contract term, which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed. \n\nVeterinary software post-contract support provides customers with access to technical support when and as needed through access to call centers and online customer assistance. Post-contract support contracts typically have a term of 12 months and customers are billed for post-contract support in equal quarterly amounts over the term. We recognize revenue for post-contract support services over time on a ratable basis using a time-elapsed measure of performance over the contract term, which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed. \n\nOn December 31, 2021, our deferred revenue related to extended warranties and post-contract support was $ 30.0 million, of which approximately $ 21.3 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, as a result of new agreements, our deferred revenue related to extended warranties and post-contract support was $ 26.4 million at December 31, 2022. We do not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that are part of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less, and do not adjust for the effect of the financing components when the period between customer payment and revenue recognition is one year or less. Deferred revenue related to extended warranties and post-contract support with an original duration of more than one year was $ 11.3 million at December 31, 2022, of which approximately 44 %, 31 %, 14 %, 6 %, and 5 % are expected to be recognized during 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and thereafter, respectively. We have determined these agreements do not include a significant financing component. \n\nSaaS Subscriptions . We offer a variety of veterinary software and diagnostic imaging SaaS subscriptions including ezyVet, Animana, Neo, Cornerstone Cloud, Pet Health Network Pro, Petly Plans, Web PACS, rVetLink, and SmartFlow. We recognize revenue for our SaaS subscriptions over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts vary in term from monthly to two years . Customers typically pay for our subscription contracts in equal monthly amounts over the term of the agreement. Deferred revenue related to our SaaS subscriptions is not material. \n\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations . We enter into contracts with multiple performance obligations where customers purchase a combination of IDEXX products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment. We determine the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments, we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized. We evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts. \n\nWe allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices, and recognize revenue when transfer of the related goods or services has occurred for each obligation. We utilize the observable standalone selling price when available, which represents the price charged for the promised product or service when sold separately. When standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable, we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including, but not limited to, the cost plus a margin approach. We recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, as described in the revenue categories above. We do not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that are part of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. \n\nF-14 \n\nThe following customer programs represent our most significant customer contracts which contain multiple performance obligations: \n\n&#160; Customer Commitment Programs . We offer customer incentives upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. \n\nUp-Front Customer Loyalty Programs . Our up-front loyalty programs provide customers with incentives in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services. If a customer breaches their agreement, they are required to refund all or a portion of the up-front cash or IDEXX Points, or make other repayments, remedial actions, or both. Up-front incentives to customers in the form of cash or IDEXX Points are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as customer acquisition costs within other current and long-term assets, which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement. If these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments, we allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases less up-front incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations, and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance. To the extent invoiced instrument revenue exceeds recognized instrument revenue, we record deferred revenue as a contract liability, which is subsequently recognized upon the purchase of products and services over the term of the contract. We have determined these agreements do not include a significant financing component. \n\nOn December 31, 2021, our capitalized customer acquisition costs were $ 158.3 million, of which approximately $ 48.9 million was recognized as a reduction of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, as a result of new up-front customer loyalty payments, net of subsequent recognition, our capitalized customer acquisition costs were $ 158.0 million at December 31, 2022. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs and review estimates of variable consideration. Impairments and revenue adjustments that relate to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods, including cumulative catch-up adjustments to revenue arising from contract modifications, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were not material. \n\nVolume Commitment Programs . Our volume commitment programs, such as our IDEXX 360 program, provide customers with free or discounted instruments or systems upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. We allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer, which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer. Our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract asset within other current and long-term assets. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for products and services over the term of the contract. We have determined these agreements do not include a significant financing component. \n\nOn December 31, 2021, our volume commitment contract assets were $ 159.9 million, of which approximately $ 38.0 million was reclassified to accounts receivable when customers were billed for related products and services during the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, as a result of new placements under volume commitment programs, net of subsequent amounts reclassified to accounts receivable, and allowances established for credit losses, our volume commitment contract assets were $ 190.8 million at December 31, 2022. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our contract assets and review estimates of variable consideration. Impairments and revenue adjustments that relate to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods, including cumulative catch-up adjustments to revenue arising from contract modifications, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were not material. \n\nFor our up-front customer loyalty and volume commitment programs, we estimate future revenues related to multi-year agreements to be approximately $ 3.2 billion, of which approximately 28 %, 25 %, 20 %, 15 %, and 12 % are expected to be recognized during 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and thereafter, respectively. These future revenues relate to performance obligations not yet satisfied, for which customers have committed to future purchases, net of the expected revenue reductions from customer acquisition costs and expected price adjustments, and as a result, are lower than stated contractual commitments by our customers. \n\nF-15 \n\nInstrument Rebate Programs . Our instrument rebate programs require an instrument purchase and provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the program. We account for the customer&#8217;s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the program. Total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional. We allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations, including the customer&#8217;s right to earn rebates on future purchases, which is deferred and subsequently recognized upon the purchase of products and services, partly offsetting rebates as they are earned. \n\nOn December 31, 2021, our deferred revenue related to instrument rebate programs was $ 33.0 million, of which approximately $ 12.0 million was recognized when customers purchased eligible products and services and earned rebates during the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, as a result of new instrument purchases under rebate programs, net of subsequent recognition, our deferred revenue was $ 25.6 million at December 31, 2022, of which approximately 36 %, 25 %, 17 %, 13 %, and 9 % are expected to be recognized during 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and thereafter, respectively. \n\nReagent Rental Programs . Our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments upon entering into multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables. These types of agreements include an embedded lease for the right to use our instrument and we determine the amount of lease revenue allocated to the instrument based on relative standalone selling prices. We evaluate the terms of these embedded leases to determine classification as either a sales-type lease or an operating lease. \n\nSales-type Reagent Rental Programs . Our reagent rental programs that effectively transfer control of instruments to our customers are classified as sales-type leases and we recognize instrument revenue and cost in advance of billing the customer, at the time of installation and customer acceptance. Our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a lease receivable within other current and long-term assets, and is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for products and services over the term of the contract. On December 31, 2021, our lease receivable assets were $ 15.3 million, of which approximately $ 3.4 million was reclassified to accounts receivable when customers were billed for related products and services during the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, as a result of new placements under sales-type reagent rental programs, net of subsequent amounts reclassified to accounts receivable, and allowances established for credit losses, our lease receivable assets were $ 18.4 million at December 31, 2022. The impacts of discounting and unearned income at December 31, 2022, were not material. Profit and loss recognized at the commencement date and interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022 were not material. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our lease receivable assets. Impairments during the year ended December 31, 2022 were not material. \n\nOperating-type Reagent Rental Programs . Our reagent rental programs that do not effectively transfer control of instruments to our customers are classified as operating leases and we recognize instrument revenue and costs ratably over the term of the agreement. The cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment. \n\nWe estimate future revenue to be recognized related to our reagent rental programs of approximately $ 42.8 million, of which approximately 30 %, 25 %, 20 %, 13 %, and 12 % are expected to be recognized during 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and thereafter, respectively. These future revenues relate to performance obligations not yet satisfied for which customers have committed to future purchases, net of expected price adjustments, and as a result, may be lower than stated contractual commitments by our customers. \n\nOther Customer Incentive Programs . Certain agreements with customers include discounts or rebates on the sale of products and services applied retrospectively, such as volume rebates achieved by purchasing a specified purchase threshold of goods and services. We account for these discounts as variable consideration and estimate the likelihood of a customer meeting the threshold in order to determine the transaction price using the most predictive approach. We typically use the most-likely-amount method for incentives that are offered to individual customers, and the expected-value method for programs that are offered to a broad group of customers. Revenue adjustments that relate to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods, including cumulative catch-up adjustments to revenue arising from contract modifications, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were not material. Refund \n\nF-16 \n\nobligations related to customer incentive programs are recorded in accrued liabilities for the actual issuance of incentives, incentives earned but not yet issued, and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future. \n\nProgram Combinations . At times, we combine elements of our significant customer programs within a single customer contract. We separate each significant program element and include the contract assets, customer acquisition costs, deferred revenues, and estimated future revenues within the most relevant program disclosures above. Each customer contract is presented as a net contract asset or net contract liability on our consolidated balance sheet. \n\nIDEXX Points . IDEXX Points may be applied to trade receivables due to us, converted to cash, or applied against the purchase price of IDEXX products and services. We consider IDEXX Points equivalent to cash. IDEXX Points that have not yet been used by customers are included in accrued liabilities until utilized or expired. Breakage is not material because customers can apply IDEXX Points to trade receivables at any time. \n\nAccounts Receivable . We recognize revenue when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we will be entitled, based on the customer&#8217;s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer&#8217;s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer&#8217;s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. We have no significant customers that accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues and we have no concentration of credit risk as of December 31, 2022. \n\nDisaggregated Revenues . We present disaggregated revenue for our CAG segment based on major product and service categories. Our Water segment is comprised of a single major product category. Although our LPD segment does not meet the quantitative requirements to be reported as a separate segment, we believe it is important to disaggregate these revenues as a major product and service category separately from our Other reportable segment given its distinct markets, and therefore we have elected to report LPD as a reportable segment. \n\nThe following table presents disaggregated revenue by major product and service categories: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 CAG segment revenue: &#160; &#160; &#160; CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue: $ 2,660,280 &#160; $ 2,534,562 &#160; $ 2,113,839 &#160; IDEXX VetLab consumables 1,057,236 &#160; 1,006,781 &#160; 824,376 &#160; Rapid assay products 313,667 &#160; 296,852 &#160; 253,018 &#160; Reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services 1,178,113 &#160; 1,123,656 &#160; 946,268 &#160; CAG Diagnostics services and accessories 111,264 &#160; 107,273 &#160; 90,177 &#160; CAG Diagnostics capital - instruments 147,326 &#160; 149,140 &#160; 108,950 &#160; Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems 251,187 &#160; 206,258 &#160; 162,976 &#160; CAG segment revenue 3,058,793 &#160; 2,889,960 &#160; 2,385,765 &#160; Water segment revenue 155,720 &#160; 146,505 &#160; 128,625 &#160; LPD segment revenue 122,607 &#160; 135,887 &#160; 145,845 &#160; Other segment revenue 30,204 &#160; 43,008 &#160; 46,420 &#160; Total revenue $ 3,367,324 &#160; $ 3,215,360 &#160; $ 2,706,655 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-17 \n\nRevenue by principal geographic area, based on customers&#8217; domiciles, was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Americas &#160; &#160; &#160; United States $ 2,182,959 &#160; $ 1,995,683 &#160; $ 1,691,224 &#160; Canada 142,743 &#160; 139,727 &#160; 107,398 &#160; Latin America &#38; Caribbean 75,035 &#160; 66,623 &#160; 51,863 &#160; 2,400,737 &#160; 2,202,033 &#160; 1,850,485 &#160; Europe, the Middle East and Africa Germany 137,876 &#160; 146,762 &#160; 119,353 &#160; United Kingdom 110,400 &#160; 114,955 &#160; 90,156 &#160; France 84,479 &#160; 90,836 &#160; 74,814 &#160; Italy 48,192 &#160; 52,062 &#160; 42,817 &#160; Spain 46,982 &#160; 48,169 &#160; 39,265 &#160; Switzerland 30,646 &#160; 31,984 &#160; 24,850 &#160; Netherlands 26,882 &#160; 29,656 &#160; 23,461 &#160; Other 161,577 &#160; 167,525 &#160; 148,049 &#160; 647,034 &#160; 681,949 &#160; 562,765 &#160; Asia Pacific Region Australia 96,408 &#160; 94,414 &#160; 79,629 &#160; Japan 77,661 &#160; 84,275 &#160; 74,725 &#160; China 49,193 &#160; 63,166 &#160; 70,845 &#160; Other 96,291 &#160; 89,523 &#160; 68,206 &#160; 319,553 &#160; 331,378 &#160; 293,405 &#160; Total $ 3,367,324 &#160; $ 3,215,360 &#160; $ 2,706,655 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCosts to Obtain a Contract . We capitalize sales commissions and the related fringe benefits earned by our sales force when considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract that includes future performance obligations. Our contracts include performance obligations related to various goods and services, some of which are satisfied at a point in time and others over time. Commission costs related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time are expensed at the time of sale, which is when revenue is recognized. Commission costs related to long-term service contracts and performance obligations satisfied over time, including extended warranties and SaaS subscriptions, are deferred and recognized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. We apply judgment in estimating the amortization period, which ranges from 3 to 7 years, by taking into consideration our customer contract terms, history of renewals, and expected length of customer relationship, as well as the useful life of the underlying technology and products. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Deferred commission costs are periodically reviewed for impairment. \n\nOn December 31, 2021, our deferred commission costs, included within other assets, were $ 19.5 million, of which approximately $ 6.5 million of commission expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, as a result of commissions related to new extended warranties and SaaS subscriptions, net of subsequent recognition, our deferred commission costs were $ 19.2 million at December 31, 2022. Impairments of deferred commission costs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were not material. \n\nNOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS, ASSET PURCHASES AND INVESTMENTS \n\nWe believe that our acquisitions of businesses and other assets enhance our existing businesses by either expanding our geographic range, customer base, or existing product and service lines. From time to time, we may acquire small reference laboratories or radiology practices that we account for as either asset purchases or business combinations. \n\nAsset Purchases and Investments \n\nDuring 2022, we entered into two discrete arrangements to license intellectual property for which we paid $ 65.0 million and accrued $ 15.0 million in subsequent payments, all of which was charged to research and development expense. The $ 15.0 million milestone payment was issued in the first quarter of 2023. These two arrangements were treated as asset acquisitions under U.S. GAAP and resulted in the full amount being expensed to research and development expense as in- \n\nF-18 \n\nprocess research and development costs with no alternative future use. The acquisition of these licensing arrangements supports new instrument platform advancements. We also made a $ 10.0 million payment for a perpetual intellectual property license, which will be amortized over 10 years. The research and development expense and amortization expense were recorded in our CAG segment. \n\nDuring 2022 we also purchased $ 25.0 million of preferred shares for a noncontrolling minority interest in one of the entities with which we have a license agreement. We have elected to measure the investment as an equity security investment, under ASC 321, &#8220;Investment - Equity Securities,&#8221; and recorded the investment at cost. The investment is included in other long-term assets. \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we acquired the assets of an international water testing company located in Canada for approximately $ 12.8 million in cash, including a holdback of approximately $ 1.3 million. This acquisition expands our product offering in the Water segment. The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired consists of technology intangibles of approximately $ 3.4 million, with a life of 10 years; customer relationship intangibles of approximately $ 1.2 million, with a life of 10 years; approximately $ 6.9 million of goodwill, representing synergies with our Water testing portfolio; and approximately $ 1.3 million of tangible assets, including inventory and accounts receivable. Goodwill related to this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma information has not been presented for this acquisition because such information is not material to the financial statements. The results of operations have been included in our Water segment since the acquisition date. The acquisition expenses were not material. \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired the shares of a reference laboratory located in Finland for approximately $ 13.4 million in cash, including a holdback of approximately $ 1.4 million. This acquisition expands our international reference laboratory presence and was accounted for as a business combination. The fair values of the assets acquired consist of customer relationship intangibles of approximately $ 7.4 million, with a life of 10 years; a non-compete agreement of approximately $ 0.8 million, with a life of 3 years; approximately $ 6.9 million of goodwill, representing synergies within our broader CAG portfolio; and approximately $ 1.7 million in net tangible liabilities. Goodwill related to this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma information has not been presented for this acquisition because such information is not material to the financial statements. The results of operations have been included in our CAG segment since the acquisition date. The acquisition expenses were not material. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, we acquired the assets of a teleradiology business for approximately $ 5.4 million, including a contingent payment of $ 0.3 million. This acquisition expands our current teleradiology capability. The acquired assets primarily consist of a customer relationship intangible of approximately $ 1.7 million, with a weighted average life of 10 years , and approximately $ 3.7 million in goodwill. Goodwill related to this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma information has not been presented for this acquisition because such information is not material to the financial statements. The results of operations have been included in our CAG segment since the acquisition date. The acquisition expenses were not material. \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, we acquired the assets of the ezyVet cloud-based veterinary software businesses and the shares of ezyVet US, Inc., as well as the Vet Radar business assets, for approximately $ 157.2 million, including an estimated contingent payment of $ 5.0 million. The acquired assets include the ezyVet cloud-native practice management system software and the Vet Radar cloud-based workflow management software. The acquisition expands our cloud-based software offerings to support our customers with technology solutions that raise the standards of care for patients and improve practice efficiency. The fair values of assets acquired were as follow: approximately $ 32.0 million in customer-related intangible with a weighted average life of 10 years; approximately $ 8.4 million in technology-related intangibles with a weighted average life of 6 years; approximately $ 2.4 million in trademarks with a weighted average life of 14 years; approximately $ 1.8 million in non-compete agreements with a weighted average life of 5 years; approximately $ 109.4 million in goodwill, r epresenting synergies within our broader CAG portfolio; and approximately $ 3.2 million in net tangible assets. Goodwill has been allocated to multiple reporting units based upon the fair value of projected earnings as of the date of the acquisition. The goodwill was allocated as follows: approximately $ 23.4 million to IDEXX VetLab&#174;, approximately $ 27.0 million to Reference Laboratories, approximately $ 11.1 million to Rapid Assay, and approximately $ 47.9 million to Veterinary Software Services. Goodwill related to this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma information has not been presented for this acquisition because such information is not material to the financial statements. The results of operations have been included in our CAG segment since the acquisition date. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we increased the contingent payable by $ 2.0 million, for a total expected payment of $ 7.0 million, which was subsequently paid during 2022. The increase to the \n\nF-19 \n\ncontingent payment is expensed as the adjustment was made after the measurement period. The acquisition expenses were approximately $ 2.2 million. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we acquired the shares of a reference laboratory located in Switzerland for approximately $ 5.5 million in cash, including holdback and contingent payments of approximately $ 1.1 million. This acquisition expands our international reference laboratory presence and was accounted for as a business combination. The fair values of the assets acquired consist of approximately $ 4.3 million in intangible assets, primarily for customer relationships, which will be amortized over 9 years, approximately $ 1.8 million for goodwill, representing synergies within our broader CAG portfolio, and approximately $ 0.6 million of liabilities, including deferred taxes associated with the acquired intangible assets. Goodwill related to this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma information has not been presented for this acquisition because such information is not material to the financial statements. The results of operations have been included in our CAG segment since the acquisition date. The acquisition expenses were not material. \n\nAcquisition of noncontrolling interest \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired the remaining 5 % interest of our sole foreign joint venture operation for approximately $ 1.0 million. As a result, we no longer record any minority interest in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet. This transaction is recorded as an equity transaction, with no gain or loss reflected in the consolidated statements of income. \n\n&#160; \n\nNOTE 5. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nWe provide for various forms of share-based compensation awards to our employees and non-employee directors. Our share-based compensation plans allow for the issuance of a mix of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, employee stock purchase rights, and other stock unit awards. With the exception of stock options, the fair value of our awards is equal to the closing stock price of IDEXX common stock on the date of grant. We calculate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. For stock options, restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;), and deferred stock units (&#8220;DSUs&#8221;), share-based compensation expense is recognized net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award for stock options. For performance-based restricted stock units (&#8220;PBRSUs&#8221;), share-based compensation expense is recognized net of estimated forfeitures, on a grade-vesting methodology over the requisite service period. &#160; \n\nStock options permit a holder to buy IDEXX stock upon vesting at the stock option exercise price set on the day of grant. An RSU is an agreement to issue shares of IDEXX stock at the time of vesting. A PBRSU is an agreement to issue shares of IDEXX stock at the time of vesting upon successful completion of certain performance goals. DSUs are granted under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the &#8220;Executive Plan&#8221;) and non-employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the &#8220;Director Plan&#8221;). DSUs may or may not have vesting conditions depending on the plan under which they are issued. We did not issue any restricted stock or stock appreciation rights during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, nor were any restricted stock or stock appreciation rights outstanding as of those years ended. \n\nWe primarily issue shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises and employee stock purchase rights and to settle RSUs, PBRSUs, and DSUs. We issue shares of treasury stock to settle certain RSUs and upon the exercise of certain stock options, which were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The number of shares of common stock and treasury stock issued are equivalent to the number of awards exercised or settled. \n\nWith the exception of employee stock purchase rights, equity awards are issued to employees and non-employee di rectors under the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2018 Stock Plan&#8221;). Our Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of 7.5 million shar es of our common stock under the 2018 Stock Plan. Any shares that are subject to awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as one share for every share granted. Any shares that are issued other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as 2.4 shares for every share granted. If any shares issued under our prior plans are forfeited, settled for cash, or expire, these shares, to the extent of such forfeiture, cash settlement, or expiration, will again be available for issuance under the 2018 Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 6.3 million remaining shares available for issuance under the 2018 Stock Plan. \n\nF-20 \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nShare-based compensation costs are classified in the consolidated financial statements consistent with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such share-based compensation. The following is a summary of share-based compensation costs and related tax benefits recorded in our consolidated statements of income: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; Share-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue $ 4,638 &#160; $ 4,044 &#160; $ 3,415 &#160; Share-based compensation expense included in operating expenses 45,132 &#160; 33,711 &#160; 27,536 &#160; Total share-based compensation expense included in consolidated statements of income 49,770 &#160; 37,755 &#160; 30,951 &#160; Income tax benefit resulting from share-based compensation expense ( 4,658 ) ( 4,734 ) ( 3,965 ) Net share-based compensation expense included in consolidated statements of income, excluding tax benefit from settlement of share-based awards 45,112 &#160; 33,021 &#160; 26,986 &#160; Income tax benefit resulting from settlement of share-based awards ( 12,522 ) ( 32,474 ) ( 38,981 ) Net expense (benefit) related to share-based compensation arrangements included in consolidated statements of income $ 32,590 &#160; $ 547 &#160; $ ( 11,995 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nThere were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options, RSUs, PBRSUs, or DSUs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\nShare-based compensation expense is reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. We use historical data and other factors to estimate expected employee terminations and to evaluate whether particular groups of employees have significantly different forfeiture expectations. Our share-based awards granted in certain years include a retirement provision for all employees based on age and length of service. These grants are subject to accelerated expensing if the holder meets the retirement definition set forth in the applicable equity and incentive plan document. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for unvested share-based compensation awards at December 31, 2022, was $ 65.1 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.3 years. \n\nStock Options \n\nPrior to December 4, 2019, all options granted to employees primarily vest ratably over five years on each anniversary of the date of grant. Options granted to non-employee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Employee grants after December 4, 2019 vest ratably over four years . Vesting of option awards issued is conditional based on continuous service, unless the employee retires under the retirement provision, for grants issued in 2018, 2019, and 2022, for which they will vest for two additional years following the retirement date. Options granted after May 8, 2013 have a contractual term of ten years . Upon any change in control of the company, 25 % of the unvested stock options then outstanding will vest and become exercisable. However, if the acquiring entity does not assume outstanding options, then all options will vest immediately prior to the change in control. \n\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors. We derive the expected term based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields for a maturity approximating the expected term calculated at the date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time; therefore, we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards. \n\nF-21 \n\nWe determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards as of the date of grant. Differences in the expected stock price volatility, expected term or risk-free interest rate may necessitate distinct valuation assumptions at those grant dates. As such, we may use different assumptions for options granted throughout the year. The weighted averages of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option award on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; Expected stock price volatility 30 &#160; % 30 &#160; % 27 &#160; % Expected term, in years 6.4 6.2 6.0 Risk-free interest rate 2.1 &#160; % 0.7 &#160; % 1.4 &#160; % Weighted average fair value of options granted $ 166.30 &#160; $ 169.15 &#160; $ 84.92 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nA summary of the status of options granted under our share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2022, and changes during the year then ended, are presented in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Options (000) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value ($000) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 1,757 &#160; $ 188.47 &#160; Granted 158 &#160; $ 494.75 &#160; Exercised ( 173 ) $ 118.96 &#160; Forfeited ( 39 ) $ 347.18 &#160; Expired ( 2 ) $ 544.08 &#160; Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 1,701 &#160; $ 219.90 &#160; 5.3 $ 352,274 &#160; Fully vested as of December 31, 2022 1,202 &#160; $ 156.37 &#160; 4.3 $ 307,580 &#160; Fully vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2022 1,684 &#160; $ 217.85 &#160; 5.2 $ 351,359 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total fair value of options vested were $ 20.4 million, $ 17.3 million, and $ 14.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively . \n\nIntrinsic value of stock options exercised represents the amount by which the market price of the common stock exceeded the exercise price, before applicable income taxes. The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised were $ 54.6 million, $ 147.9 million, and $ 163.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nRestricted Stock Units \n\nPrior to December 4, 2019, the majority of RSUs, including our PBRSUs, granted to employees vest ratably over five years on each anniversary of the date of grant. Employee grants after December 4, 2019, will vest ratably over 4 years. PBRSUs granted to employees vest based on meeting performance goals set on the day of grant. RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting as it relates to RSUs and PBRSUs issued is conditional based on continuous service, unless the employee retires under the retirement provision, for grants issued in 2018, 2019, and 2022, for which they will vest for two additional years following the retirement date. Upon any change in control of the company, 25 % of the unvested RSUs and PBRSUs then outstanding will vest, provided, however, that if the acquiring entity does not assume the RSUs and PBRSUs, then all such units will vest immediately prior to the change in control. At time of grant, we assume all PBRSUs will meet performance goals to vest. \n\nF-22 \n\nA summary of the status of RSUs and PBRSUs granted under our share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2022, and changes during the period then ended, are presented in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Units (000) Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value &#160; &#160; Nonvested as of December 31, 2021 165 &#160; $ 306.18 &#160; Granted 59 &#160; Vested ( 66 ) Forfeited ( 10 ) Nonvested as of December 31, 2022 148 &#160; $ 391.55 &#160; Expected to vest as of December 31, 2022 141 &#160; $ 389.24 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total fair values of RSUs and PBRSUs vested were $ 32.9 million, $ 46.1 million, and $ 27.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of nonvested RSUs and PBRSUs as of December 31, 2022, which is equal to the fair value of IDEXX&#8217;s common stock as of December 31, 2022, multiplied by the number of nonvested units as of December 31, 2022, was $ 60.3 million. \n\nDeferred Stock Units \n\nUnder our Director Plan, non-employee directors may defer a portion of their cash fees in the form of vested DSUs. Prior to 2014, certain members of our management could elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation in the form of vested deferred stock units under our Executive Plan. Each DSU represents the right to receive one unissued share of our common stock. These recipients receive a number of DSUs equal to the amount of cash fees or compensation deferred divided by the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of deferral. \n\nAlso under the Director Plan, non-employee directors are awarded annual grants of either RSUs or DSUs that vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting for these annual RSU and DSU grants is conditional based on continuous service. Vested DSUs are distributed as shares of common stock on the distribution date elected by the participant and pursuant to the terms of the Director or Executive Plan, as applicable. \n\nThere were approximately 58,000 and 90,000 vested DSUs outstanding under our share-based compensation plans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022, approximately 33,000 DSUs were distributed as shares of common stock. Unvested DSUs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, were not material. \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Rights \n\nEmployee stock purchase rights are issued under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 4.7 million shares of common stock in periodic offerings. Under this plan, stock is sold to employees at a 15 % discount off the closing price of the stock on the last day of each quarter. The dollar value of this discount is equal to the fair value of purchase rights recognized as share-based compensation. We issued approximately 44,600 , 29,500 , and 39,000 shares of common stock in connection with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 1.0 million remaining shares available for issuance under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. \n\nNOTE 6. CREDIT LOSSES \n\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our sales of products and services to our customers. We maintain allowances for credit losses for potentially uncollectible receivables. We base our estimates on a detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current economic conditions. Refer to &#8220;Note 2. Accounting Policies&#8221; for more information on our adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective transition method. \n\nF-23 \n\nAdditional allowances may be required if either the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate, or a strengthening U.S. dollar impacts the ability of foreign customers to make payments to us on their U.S. dollar-denominated purchases. We monitor our ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty balances against contract terms and due dates. Our activities include timely account reconciliations, dispute resolution, and payment confirmations. We may employ collection agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables. \n\nAccount balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. We may require collateralized asset support or a prepayment to mitigate credit risk. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers. \n\nAccounts Receivable \n\nThe allowance for credit losses associated with accounts receivable was $ 8.3 million and $ 5.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of accounts receivable reflected on the balance sheet is net of this reserve. Based on an aging analysis, at December 31, 2022, approximately 86 % of our accounts receivable had not yet reached the invoice due date and approximately 14 % was considered past due, of which approximately 2.0 % was greater than 60 days past due. At December 31, 2021, approximately 90 % of our accounts receivable had not yet reached the invoice due date and approximately 10 % was considered past due, of which approximately 1.8 % was greater than 60 days past due. Write-offs and recoveries related to credit losses during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material. \n\nContract assets and lease receivables \n\nThe allowance for credit losses associated with contract assets and lease receivables was $ 5.5 million and $ 4.4 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The assets reflected on the balance sheet are net of these reserves. Historically, we have experienced low credit loss rates on our customer commitment programs and lease receivables. We apply judgment in determining the customer&#8217;s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer&#8217;s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. Write-offs and recoveries related to credit losses during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material. \n\nNOTE 7. &#160; INVENTORIES \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand, market conditions, remaining shelf life, or product functionality. If actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations. \n\nUnpaid inventory reflected within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets was $ 59.4 million, $ 64.4 million, and $ 45.6 million at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Instrument inventory transferred to property and equipment related to rental and operating-type reagent rental programs was $ 17.4 million, $ 11.6 million, $ 9.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe components of inventories are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; Raw materials $ 92,796 &#160; $ 60,427 &#160; Work-in-process 28,041 &#160; 26,397 &#160; Finished goods 246,986 &#160; 182,206 &#160; Inventories $ 367,823 &#160; $ 269,030 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-24 \n\nNOTE 8. &#160; LEASES \n\nThe majority of our facilities are occupied under operating lease arrangements with various expiration dates through 2067, some of which include options to extend the life of the lease, and some of which include options to terminate the lease within 1 year. In certain instances, we are responsible for the real estate taxes and operating expenses related to these facilities. Additionally, we enter into operating leases for certain vehicles and equipment in the normal course of business. We determine the expected term of any executed agreements using the non-cancelable lease term plus any renewal options by which the failure to renew imposes a penalty in such amount that renewal is reasonably assured. The derived expected term is then used in the determination of a financing or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Rent escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in our capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases. Minimum lease payments include the fixed lease component of the agreement, as well as fixed rate increases that are initially measured at the lease commencement date. Variable lease payments based on an index and payments associated with non-lease components and short-term rentals (leases with terms less than 12 months) are expensed as incurred. Consideration is allocated to the lease and non-lease components based on the estimated standalone prices. \n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, accrued liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our financing leases are not material to the financial statements. \n\nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an explicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Rent expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any rent prepayments, lease incentives upon receipt, and straight-line rent expense impacts, which represent the differences between our operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. \n\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) December 31, 2022 &#160; 2023 $ 24,559 &#160; 2024 22,178 &#160; 2025 17,879 &#160; 2026 15,207 &#160; 2027 12,157 &#160; Thereafter 50,677 &#160; Total lease payments 142,657 &#160; Less imputed interest ( 20,993 ) Total lease liability (current and long-term) $ 121,664 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal minimum future lease payments of approximately $ 0.6 million for leases that have not commenced as of December 31, 2022, are not included in the consolidated financial statements, as we do not yet control the underlying assets.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET \n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are relieved, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment periodically or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable from future cash flows. If the carrying value of our property and equipment is impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the property and equipment exceeds its fair value. We provide for depreciation and amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to the consolidated statements of income in amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Asset Classification &#160; Estimated Useful Life &#160; &#160; Land improvements &#160; \n\n15 to 20 years \n\nBuildings and improvements &#160; \n\n10 to 40 years \n\nLeasehold improvements &#160; Shorter of remaining lease term or useful life of improvements Machinery and equipment &#160; \n\n3 to 8 years \n\nOffice furniture and equipment &#160; \n\n3 to 7 years \n\nComputer hardware and software &#160; \n\n3 to 7 years \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nWe capitalize interest on the acquisition and construction of significant assets that require a substantial period of time to be made ready for use. The capitalized interest is included in the cost of the completed asset and depreciated over the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life. The amount of interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was not material. \n\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software designated for internal use based on three distinct stages of development. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage, which consist primarily of internal payroll and direct fringe benefits and external direct project costs, including labor and travel, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation and operation phases are expensed as incurred. These costs relate primarily to the determination of performance requirements, data conversion, and training. Software developed to deliver hosted services to our customers has been designated as internal use. \n\nF-26 \n\nProperty and equipment, net, consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; Land and improvements $ 22,221 &#160; $ 22,642 &#160; Buildings and improvements 356,049 &#160; 329,091 &#160; Leasehold improvements 107,251 &#160; 93,248 &#160; Machinery and equipment 404,963 &#160; 382,753 &#160; Office furniture and equipment 71,625 &#160; 69,090 &#160; Computer hardware and software 295,969 &#160; 276,895 &#160; Construction in progress 97,310 &#160; 62,339 &#160; 1,355,388 &#160; 1,236,058 &#160; Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 705,914 &#160; 648,391 &#160; Total property and equipment, net $ 649,474 &#160; $ 587,667 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nBelow are the amounts of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, capitalized computer software for internal use, unpaid property and equipment reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and rental and reagent rental program instruments transferred from inventory to property and equipment: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; Depreciation and amortization expense $ 96,746 &#160; $ 92,376 &#160; $ 86,095 &#160; Capitalized computer software developed for internal use $ 20,329 &#160; $ 14,753 &#160; $ 18,472 &#160; Unpaid property and equipment, reflected in accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 18,334 &#160; $ 19,326 &#160; $ 13,343 &#160; Rental and operating-type reagent rental program instruments transferred from inventory to property and equipment (Note 3) $ 17,407 &#160; $ 11,628 &#160; $ 9,645 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe had no material impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2020.

Refer to &#8220;Note 6. Credit Losses .&#8221; \n\nNOTE 11. &#160; GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET \n\nA significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value. If a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When significant, we typically utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be separately identified and recognized. \n\nOur business combinations regularly include contingent consideration arrangements that require additional consideration to be paid based on the achievement of established objectives, most commonly related to customer retention or revenue growth of the customer base during the post-combination period. We assess contingent consideration to determine if it should be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings if changes in estimates are made after the measurement period. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we increased the fair value of the contingent payment to ezyVet by $ 2.0 million. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and differences arising upon settlement were not material during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. The more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would assess the fair value of all of our reporting units and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the carrying value exceeds its fair value, and if a goodwill impairment loss should be recognized. In contrast, we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to assessing the fair value of all of our reporting units and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to carrying value to determine if any impairment exists. Doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment and concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If a reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, is compared to the fair value and goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. Any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill above its fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss. No goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020, and no accumulated impairment losses are recorded. \n\nF-28 \n\nWe assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets, other than goodwill, based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group. The asset group is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows associated with the intangible asset are largely independent. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If the net carrying value of the asset group exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss to adjust the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. If necessary, we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and apply a risk-adjusted discount rate. We had no impairments of our intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020. The amount of impairment for the year ended December 31, 2021 was immaterial. \n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) CAG Water LPD Other Consolidated Total Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 207,350 &#160; $ 11,611 &#160; $ 14,232 &#160; $ 6,531 &#160; $ 239,724 &#160; Business combinations 220 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 220 &#160; Acquisition adjustment ( 1,900 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1,900 ) Impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 4,724 &#160; 412 &#160; 167 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5,303 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 210,394 &#160; $ 12,023 &#160; $ 14,399 &#160; $ 6,531 &#160; $ 243,347 &#160; Business combinations 120,346 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 120,346 &#160; Impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ( 3,569 ) ( 84 ) ( 695 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 4,348 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 327,171 &#160; $ 11,939 &#160; $ 13,704 &#160; $ 6,531 &#160; $ 359,345 &#160; Business combinations 1,641 &#160; 6,857 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8,498 &#160; Impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ( 5,330 ) ( 897 ) 179 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 6,048 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 323,482 &#160; $ 17,899 &#160; $ 13,883 &#160; $ 6,531 &#160; $ 361,795 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRefer to &#8220;Note 4.

DEBT \n\nCredit Facility \n\nOn October 20, 2022, we, along with IDEXX Distribution, Inc., IDEXX Operations, Inc., OPTI Medical Systems, Inc., IDEXX Laboratories Canada Corporation, IDEXX B.V., IDEXX Laboratories B.V., and IDEXX Laboratories GmbH, each a wholly-owned subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly held) (collectively, the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;), together with the lenders party to that certain Existing Credit Agreement (as defined below), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (&#8220;Agent&#8221;), and the other parties thereto, entered into Amendment No. 1 (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;), to that certain fourth amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 9, 2021, relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $ 1.0 billion (the &#8220;Existing Credit Agreement,&#8221; and as amended by the Amendment, the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;), among the Borrowers, the lenders, the Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch, as Toronto agent, and the other parties thereto. \n\nThe Amendment amends the Existing Credit Agreement to (i) provide for a borrowing by us effective October 20, 2022, of an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $ 250 million, (ii) convert all existing borrowings, which have interest rates determined by reference to a LIBOR-based interest rate, to borrowings determined by reference to a SOFR-based interest rate, (iii) provide for an option by us to obtain incremental borrowings under the Credit Agreement of term loans and/or revolving credit commitments of up to an aggregate principal amount of $ 250 million, which would represent an aggregate maximum of up to $ 1.5 billion, subject to the Borrowers obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the Credit Agreement, and (iv) add certain implementing mechanics relating to the foregoing. \n\nOn October 20, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the term lenders thereunder provided us, as borrower, an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $ 250 million (the &#8220;Term Loan&#8221;). The Term Loan matures on October 20, 2025. The net proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay previously incurred revolver borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement. The Term Loan is subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default as the borrowings previously incurred pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement. The applicable interest rate for the Term Loan is consistent with our line of credit, and is calculated at a per annum rate equal to either (at our option) (1) a prime rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0 % to 0.375 % based on our consolidated leverage ratio, (2) an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus 0.10 %, plus a margin ranging from 0.875 % to 1.375 % based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (3) an adjusted daily simple SOFR rate, plus 0.10 %, plus a margin ranging from 0.875 % to 1.375 % based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Issuance costs for the incremental Term Loan were immaterial. \n\nAlthough the revolving line of credit does not mature until December 9, 2026, and the Term Loan does not mature until October 20, 2025, all individual borrowings under the terms of the Credit Facility with an interest rate based on the prevailing Prime or SOFR rate (as selected by the Borrower) have a stated term between 1 and 180 days. At the end of each term, the obligation is either repaid or rolled over into a new borrowing or replaced by a borrowing based on a specific benchmark rate (where interest is then paid monthly). The Credit Facility contains a subjective material adverse event notification clause, which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the Credit Facility if we fail to provide prompt written notice to the syndicate of such an event. Based on the stated terms and the existence of the subjective material adverse event clause, this Credit Facility is reflected in the current liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $ 329 million outstanding on our line of credit and a $ 250 million Term Loan, for a total of $ 579 million outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, with a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.1 %. Our weighted average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 3.1 %. At December 31, 2021, we had $ 73.5 million outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. The funds available under the Credit Facility reflect a further reduction due to the issuance of letters of credit, which were primarily issued in connection with our workers&#8217; \n\nF-31 \n\ncompensation policy, for $ 1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and $ 1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nThe obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness, and a change of control default. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, and certain restrictive agreements. The sole financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation defined as the consolidated leverage ratio under the terms of the Credit Facility, not to exceed 3.5 -to-1. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility. \n\nSenior Notes \n\nThe following describes all of our currently outstanding unsecured senior notes issued and sold in private placements (collectively, the &#8220;Senior Notes&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (Principal Amount in thousands) Issue Date Due Date Series Principal Amount Coupon Rate Senior Note Agreement 12/11/2013 12/11/2023 2023 Series A Notes $ 75,000 &#160; 3.94 &#160; % NY Life 2013 Note Agreement 12/11/2013 12/11/2025 2025 Series B Notes $ 75,000 &#160; 4.04 &#160; % NY Life 2013 Note Agreement 9/4/2014 9/4/2026 2026 Senior Notes $ 75,000 &#160; 3.72 &#160; % NY Life 2014 Note Agreement 7/21/2014 7/21/2024 2024 Series B Notes $ 75,000 &#160; 3.76 &#160; % Prudential 2015 Amended Agreement 6/18/2015 6/18/2025 2025 Series C Notes &#8364; 88,857 &#160; 1.785 &#160; % Prudential 2015 Amended Agreement 2/12/2015 2/12/2027 2027 Series B Notes $ 75,000 &#160; 3.72 &#160; % MetLife 2014 Note Agreement 3/14/2019 3/14/2029 2029 Series C Notes $ 100,000 &#160; 4.19 &#160; % MetLife 2014 Note Agreement 4/2/2020 4/2/2030 MetLife 2030 Series D Notes $ 125,000 &#160; 2.50 &#160; % MetLife 2014 Note Agreement 4/14/2020 4/14/2030 Prudential 2030 Series D Notes $ 75,000 &#160; 2.50 &#160; % Prudential 2015 Amended Agreement ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following narrative represents our Senior Note activity: \n\nNY Life 2013 and 2014 Note Agreements, Including Amendments \n\nIn December 2013, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of $ 150 million of unsecured senior notes consisting of $ 75 million of 3.94 % Series A Senior Notes due December 11, 2023 (the &#8220;2023 Series A Notes&#8221;) and $ 75 million of 4.04 % Series B Senior Notes due December 11, 2025 (the &#8220;2025 Series B Notes&#8221;) under a Note Purchase Agreement among the Company, New York Life Insurance Company, and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein (as amended on April 10, 2020, the &#8220;NY Life 2013 Note Agreement&#8221;). \n\nIn September 2014, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of $ 75 million of unsecured 3.72 % senior notes due September 4, 2026 (the &#8220;2026 Senior Notes&#8221;) under a Note Purchase Agreement dated as of July 22, 2014, among the Company, New York Life Insurance Company, and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein (as amended April 10, 2020, the &#8220;NY Life 2014 Note Agreement&#8221;). \n\nOn April 10, 2020, we amended the NY Life 2013 Note Agreement and the NY Life 2014 Note Agreement by entering into two Amendments to Note Purchase Agreement with New York Life Insurance Company and the other parties thereto, which modified several defined terms, schedules and covenant baskets in the NY Life 2013 Agreement and the NY Life 2014 Note Agreement to create additional operating flexibility, and in particular to align such provisions with similar modifications we made substantially concurrently in our other debt facilities. \n\nF-32 \n\nPrudential 2015 Amended Agreement, Including Amendments \n\nIn July 2014, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of $ 125 million of unsecured senior notes consisting of $ 50 million of 3.32 % Series A Senior Notes due July 21, 2021 (the &#8220;2021 Series A Notes&#8221;) and $ 75 million of 3.76 % Series B Senior Notes due July 21, 2024 (the &#8220;2024 Series B Notes&#8221;) under a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement among the Company, Prudential Investment Management, Inc.

The entire outstanding balance of the Prudential 2030 Series D Notes is due and payable on April 14, 2030, and the Prudential 2030 Series D Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.50 % per annum. We used the proceeds received from the Prudential 2030 Series D Notes for general corporate purposes. \n\nMetLife 2014 Note Agreement, Including Amendments \n\nWe entered into a Multicurrency Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2014 (the &#8220;Original MetLife 2014 Note Agreement&#8221;), among the Company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (&#8220;MetLife&#8221;), and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate principal amount of $ 150 million of unsecured senior notes consisting of $ 75 million of our 3.25 % Series A Senior Notes having a seven-year term (the &#8220;2022 Series A Notes&#8221;), and $ 75 million of our 3.72 % Series B Senior Notes having a twelve-year term (&#8220;2027 Series B Notes&#8221;). The issuance, sale and purchase of these notes occurred in February 2015. The aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Series A Notes for $ 75 million was paid on February 12, 2022. \n\nOn March 14, 2019, we amended the Original MetLife 2014 Note Agreement. Pursuant to the Original MetLife 2014 Note Agreement, as so amended, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of $ 100 million of unsecured senior notes at a 4.19 % per annum rate, due March 14, 2029 (the &#8220;2029 Series C Notes&#8221;). \n\nOn March 23, 2020, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Original MetLife 2014 Note Agreement (the &#8220;MetLife Second Amendment&#8221;), in order to (i) increase the facility size from $ 150 million to $ 300 million, (ii) extend the facility issuance period to December 20, 2022, (iii) make various implementing and administrative changes in order to facilitate a $ 125 million notes issuance on April 2, 2020, and (iv) allow the amount available to be issued under the facility to equal $ 300 million, less the amounts outstanding on 2029 Series C Notes and MetLife 2030 Series D Notes. \n\nOn April 2, 2020, we issued and sold to MetLife and other purchasers $ 125 million of our unsecured senior notes (the &#8220;MetLife 2030 Series D Notes&#8221;) pursuant to the MetLife Second Amendment. The entire outstanding principal balance of the \n\nF-33 \n\nMetLife 2030 Series D Notes is due and payable on April 2, 2030, and the MetLife 2030 Series D Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.50 % per annum.

The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of our subsidiaries, priority indebtedness, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements, and violations of laws and regulations. The sole financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, as defined in the Senior Note Agreements, not to exceed 3.5 -to-1. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Note Agreements. \n\nShould we elect to prepay the Senior Notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable Senior Note Agreements. Additionally, in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the Senior Note Agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the Senior Notes. The obligations under the Senior Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable Senior Note Agreement, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, and cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness. We used the net proceeds from the issuances and sale of the Senior Notes for general corporate purposes. \n\nAnnual principal payments on long-term debt at December 31, 2022, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) Years Ending December 31, Amount &#160; 2023 $ 75,000 &#160; 2024 75,000 &#160; 2025 169,775 &#160; 2026 75,000 &#160; 2027 75,000 &#160; Thereafter 300,000 &#160; $ 769,775 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal interest paid on all debt (including our Credit Facility) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was $ 39.5 million, $ 30.5 million, and $ 32.4 million, respectively. \n\nNOTE 14. &#160; INCOME TAXES \n\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. \n\nWe record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more \n\nF-34 \n\nlikely than not be sustained. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes. We classify uncertain tax positions as long-term liabilities. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Any audit result differing from amounts recorded would increase or decrease income in the period that we determine such adjustment is likely. Interest expense and penalties associated with the underpayment of income taxes are included in income tax expense. \n\nEarnings before income taxes were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; Domestic $ 684,661 &#160; $ 689,994 &#160; $ 483,694 &#160; International 175,311 &#160; 212,660 &#160; 178,291 &#160; $ 859,972 &#160; $ 902,654 &#160; $ 661,985 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes comprised the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Current &#160; &#160; &#160; Federal $ 150,099 &#160; $ 112,811 &#160; $ 72,921 &#160; State 30,529 &#160; 19,147 &#160; 17,346 &#160; International 35,138 &#160; 29,288 &#160; 26,301 &#160; 215,766 &#160; 161,246 &#160; 116,568 &#160; Deferred Federal ( 31,663 ) ( 7,019 ) ( 14,126 ) State ( 5,735 ) ( 503 ) ( 2,863 ) International 2,515 &#160; 4,086 &#160; ( 19,725 ) ( 34,883 ) ( 3,436 ) ( 36,714 ) $ 180,883 &#160; $ 157,810 &#160; $ 79,854 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. federal statutory rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 2.3 &#160; 2.1 &#160; 2.4 &#160; Taxation on international earnings 0.6 &#160; ( 0.8 ) ( 1.0 ) Foreign derived intangible income ( 1.7 ) ( 1.2 ) ( 1.1 ) Share-based compensation from settlements ( 1.5 ) ( 3.6 ) ( 5.9 ) Research and development credit ( 1.1 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 0.8 ) Impact of Switzerland tax reform &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 3.3 ) Other, net 1.4 &#160; 0.7 &#160; 0.8 &#160; Effective tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 17.5 &#160; % 12.1 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nOur effective income tax rate was 21.0 % for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 17.5 % for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was higher primarily due to decreases in tax benefits related to share-based compensation and higher taxes on international income. \n\nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds received, for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, were $ 239.8 million, $ 161.7 million, and $ 110.7 million, respectively. \n\nPrior to January 1, 2022, we received benefits from a tax ruling in the Netherlands that documented our mutual understanding of how prior tax laws applied to our circumstances. Primarily as a result of this tax ruling, our net income was \n\nF-35 \n\nhigher by $ 21.4 million and $ 14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The benefits from these tax rulings are reflected within the overall benefits received from taxation on international earnings during those years in the table above. On December 21, 2021, the Netherlands adopted legislation eliminating the tax benefits related to this tax ruling for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. \n\nThe components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; Assets &#160; &#160; Accrued expenses $ 38,457 &#160; $ 48,433 &#160; Accounts receivable reserves 2,447 &#160; 2,131 &#160; Deferred revenue 4,671 &#160; 6,269 &#160; Inventory basis differences 9,062 &#160; 6,553 &#160; Property-based differences 20,157 &#160; 16,132 &#160; Intangible asset basis differences 44,196 &#160; 46,606 &#160; Share-based compensation 11,324 &#160; 10,740 &#160; Other 1,273 &#160; 1,163 &#160; Net operating loss carryforwards 8,956 &#160; 8,570 &#160; Tax credit carryforwards 13,370 &#160; 13,483 &#160; Unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange contracts and investments 227 &#160; 1,755 &#160; Research and development expenditure differences 29,997 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total assets 184,137 &#160; 161,835 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 39,726 ) ( 39,280 ) Total assets, net of valuation allowance 144,411 &#160; 122,555 &#160; Liabilities Customer acquisition costs ( 37,223 ) ( 37,265 ) Property-based differences ( 44,295 ) ( 42,363 ) Intangible asset basis differences ( 2,379 ) ( 17,345 ) Other ( 8,958 ) ( 5,662 ) Unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts and investments ( 4,491 ) ( 4,071 ) Total liabilities ( 97,346 ) ( 106,706 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 47,065 &#160; $ 15,849 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we recorded valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets related to temporary differences, including intangible asset basis differences and net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) and tax credit carryforwards, as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or utilized within the carryforward period. \n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; Balance at beginning of year $ 39,280 &#160; $ 40,262 &#160; $ 9,454 &#160; Charges to costs and expense 2,200 &#160; 1,464 &#160; 31,076 &#160; Write-off/cash payments ( 1,537 ) ( 1,182 ) ( 34 ) Foreign currency translation ( 217 ) ( 1,264 ) ( 234 ) Balance at the end of the year $ 39,726 &#160; $ 39,280 &#160; $ 40,262 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have NOLs in certain state and international jurisdictions of approximately $ 34.1 million available to offset future taxable income. Most of these NOLs will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2029 and the remainder have indefinite lives. \n\nF-36 \n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in unrecognized tax positions: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; Total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 21,789 &#160; $ 22,484 &#160; $ 26,841 &#160; Gross increases (decreases) in unrecognized tax positions as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period 342 &#160; 443 &#160; ( 1,755 ) Gross increases in unrecognized tax positions as a result of tax positions taken in the current period 3,197 &#160; 2,414 &#160; 4,199 &#160; Decreases in unrecognized tax positions related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 1,544 ) ( 537 ) ( 6,446 ) Decreases in unrecognized tax positions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations ( 1,237 ) ( 3,015 ) ( 355 ) Total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ 22,547 &#160; $ 21,789 &#160; $ 22,484 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOf the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 20.9 million and $ 22.2 million, respectively, comprise unrecognized tax positions that would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recorded interest expense and penalties of $ 1.3 million, $ 1.1 million, and $ 1.3 million, respectively, as income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had $ 4.2 million, $ 3.8 million, and $ 3.6 million, respectively, of estimated interest expense and penalties accrued in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriately provided for all uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on income tax matters, or reductions of previously accrued provisions, could be recorded in the future as we revise our estimates due to changing facts and circumstances or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. We are currently under tax examinations in various jurisdictions. We anticipate that these examinations will be concluded within the next two years. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in any jurisdiction in which we conduct significant taxable activities for years before 2015. \n\nNOTE 15. &#160; EARNINGS PER SHARE \n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to our stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and vested deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and assumed issuance of unvested restricted stock units and unvested deferred stock units using the treasury stock method unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The treasury stock method assumes that proceeds, including cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the total unrecognized compensation expense for unvested share-based compensation awards, would be used to purchase our common stock at the average market price during the period. Vested deferred stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share because the associated shares of our common stock are issuable for no cash consideration, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued is fixed, and issuance is not contingent. Refer to &#8220;Note 5. Share-Based Compensation&#8221; for additional information regarding deferred stock units. \n\nThe following is a reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; Shares outstanding for basic earnings per share: 83,623 &#160; 85,200 &#160; 85,342 &#160; Shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share: Shares outstanding for basic earnings per share 83,623 &#160; 85,200 &#160; 85,342 &#160; Dilutive effect of share-based payment awards 977 &#160; 1,372 &#160; 1,380 &#160; 84,600 &#160; 86,572 &#160; 86,722 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-37 \n\nCertain awards and options to acquire shares have been excluded from the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.

Leases&#8221; for more information regarding our lease commitments. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into purchase obligations that include agreements and purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are contractually enforceable and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, pricing, and approximate timing of purchases. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $ 232.4 million in purchase obligations due in 2023. Our purchase obligations beyond 2023 are approximately $ 50.4 million. The expected timing of payments of our purchase obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. \n\nContingencies \n\nWe are subject to claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty, and therefore our actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed our accruals. Except for the litigation matter described below, at December 31, 2022, our accruals with respect to actual and threatened litigation were not material. \n\nWe are a defendant in an ongoing litigation matter involving an alleged breach of contract for underpayment of royalty payments made from 2004 through 2017 under an expired patent license agreement. The plaintiff has asserted a claim of approximately $ 50 million inclusive of interest through June 30, 2020, alleging that the incorrect royalty provision was applied to certain licensed products and services throughout the agreement term and that royalties were also due on non-licensed diagnostic services that were provided concurrently with licensed services. The trial court previously ruled in favor of the plaintiff in this matter. The appellate court reversed the trial court&#8217;s decision, and the plaintiff has petitioned the state supreme court for review. While we believe the claim is without merit and continue to vigorously defend ourselves against the plaintiff&#8217;s allegations, litigation is inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in this matter. During the third quarter of 2020, we established an accrual of $ 27.5 million related to this ongoing matter, which represents the amount of the contingent loss that we have determined to be probable and estimable. We have not made any adjustments to this accrual since it was established. The actual cost of resolving this matter may be higher or lower than the amount we have accrued. \n\nFrom time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any such litigation, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the litigation. \n\nF-38 \n\nGuarantees \n\nWe enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases, those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and, based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of potential indemnification under these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nWhen acquiring a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we do not have any material pre-acquisition liabilities recorded. \n\nNOTE 17. SEGMENT REPORTING \n\nWe operate primarily through three business segments: Companion Animal Group (&#8220;CAG&#8221;), Water quality products (&#8220;Water&#8221;), and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (&#8220;LPD&#8221;). CAG provides products and services for veterinarians and the biomedical research community, primarily related to diagnostics and information management. Water provides innovative testing solutions for the detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water. LPD provides diagnostic tests, services, and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve producer efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk. Our Other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic business (&#8220;OPTI Medical&#8221;) with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. OPTI Medical develops, manufactures, and distributes human medical diagnostic products and provides human medical diagnostic services. \n\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;), or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer. Our reportable segments include: CAG, Water, LPD, and Other. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes. \n\nIntersegment revenues, which are not included in the table below, were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\nF-39 \n\nThe following is a summary of segment performance: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, CAG Water LPD Other Consolidated Total 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Revenue $ 3,058,793 &#160; $ 155,720 &#160; $ 122,607 &#160; $ 30,204 &#160; $ 3,367,324 &#160; Income from operations $ 800,949 &#160; $ 72,519 &#160; $ 19,809 &#160; $ 5,488 &#160; $ 898,765 &#160; Interest expense, net ( 38,793 ) Income before provision for income taxes 859,972 &#160; Provision for income taxes 180,883 &#160; Net income 679,089 &#160; Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest &#8212; &#160; Net income attributable to IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. stockholders $ 679,089 &#160; Depreciation and amortization $ 101,254 &#160; $ 3,020 &#160; $ 3,797 &#160; $ 3,829 &#160; $ 111,900 &#160; 2021 Revenue $ 2,889,960 &#160; $ 146,505 &#160; $ 135,887 &#160; $ 43,008 &#160; $ 3,215,360 &#160; Income from operations $ 824,022 &#160; $ 65,444 &#160; $ 28,636 &#160; $ 13,926 &#160; $ 932,028 &#160; Interest expense, net ( 29,374 ) Income before provision for income taxes 902,654 &#160; Provision for income taxes 157,810 &#160; Net income 744,844 &#160; Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 1 ) Net income attributable to IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. stockholders $ 744,845 &#160; Depreciation and amortization $ 94,202 &#160; $ 2,709 &#160; $ 3,908 &#160; $ 3,777 &#160; $ 104,596 &#160; 2020 Revenue $ 2,385,765 &#160; $ 128,625 &#160; $ 145,845 &#160; $ 46,420 &#160; $ 2,706,655 &#160; Income from operations $ 574,887 &#160; $ 58,867 &#160; $ 40,008 &#160; $ 20,762 &#160; $ 694,524 &#160; Interest expense, net ( 32,539 ) Income before provision for income taxes 661,985 &#160; Provision for income taxes 79,854 &#160; Net income 582,131 &#160; Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 355 &#160; Net income attributable to IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. stockholders $ 581,776 &#160; Depreciation and amortization $ 84,697 &#160; $ 2,630 &#160; $ 4,070 &#160; $ 4,601 &#160; $ 95,998 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to &#8220;Note 3.

U.S. GAAP requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. \n\nWe have certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, and certain financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets but for which we disclose the fair value. The fair value disclosures of these assets and liabilities are based on a three-level hierarchy, which is defined as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, or transfers in or out of Level 3, of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nOur cross currency swap contracts are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We measure the fair value of our cross currency swap contracts classified as derivative instruments using prevailing market conditions as of the close of business on each balance sheet date. The product of this calculation is then adjusted for counterparty risk. \n\nOur foreign currency exchange contracts are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We measure the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts classified as derivative \n\nF-41 \n\ninstruments using an income approach, based on prevailing market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The product of this calculation is then adjusted for counterparty risk. \n\nThe amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility (&#8220;Credit Facility&#8221; or &#8220;line of credit&#8221;) and senior notes (&#8220;long-term debt&#8221;) are measured at carrying value in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets though we disclose the fair value of these financial instruments. We determine the fair value of the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility and long-term debt using an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for debt issues with similar remaining years to maturity, adjusted for applicable credit risk. Our Credit Facility and long-term debt are valued using Level 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of our Credit Facility approximates its carrying value. At December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value and carrying value of our long-term debt were $ 725.6 million and $ 769.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value and carrying value of our long-term debt were $ 916.3 million and $ 850.7 million, respectively. \n\nThe following tables set forth our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) As of December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Balance at December 31, 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nEquity mutual funds (2) \n\n$ 385 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 385 &#160; \n\nCross currency swaps (3) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 9,262 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9,262 &#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts (3) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 5,185 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 5,185 &#160; Liabilities \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts (3) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 4,572 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 4,572 &#160; \n\nDeferred compensation (4) \n\n$ 385 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 385 &#160; Contingent payments - acquisitions $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 120 &#160; $ 120 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) As of December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Balance at December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nMoney market funds (1) \n\n$ 76 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 76 &#160; \n\nEquity mutual funds (2) \n\n$ 826 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 826 &#160; \n\nCross currency swaps (3) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 4,256 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 4,256 &#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts (3) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 6,512 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6,512 &#160; Liabilities \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts (3) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 601 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 601 &#160; \n\nDeferred compensation (4) \n\n$ 826 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 826 &#160; Contingent payments - acquisitions $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7,230 &#160; $ 7,230 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Money market funds with an original maturity of less than ninety days are included within cash and cash equivalents. The remaining balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, consisted of demand deposits. \n\n(2) Equity mutual funds relate to a deferred compensation plan that was assumed as part of a previous business combination. This amount is included within other long-term assets. Refer to footnote (4) below for a discussion of the related deferred compensation liability. \n\n(3) Cross currency swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts are included within other current assets; other long-term assets; accrued liabilities; or other long-term liabilities depending on the gain (loss) position and anticipated settlement date. \n\n(4) A deferred compensation plan assumed as part of a previous business combination is included within accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The fair value of our deferred compensation plan is indexed to the performance of the underlying equity mutual funds discussed in footnote (2) above. \n\nF-42 \n\nThe estimated fair values of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximate carrying value due to their short maturity. \n\nContingent Consideration \n\nWe have classified our liabilities for contingent consideration related to acquisitions within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs, which includes the achievements of future revenues. The contingent consideration is included within other short-term liabilities. \n\nWe record changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in contingent consideration liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) and during the year ended December 31, 2022, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) Fair Value &#160; Contingent consideration as of December 31, 2021 $ 7,230 &#160; Payment of contingent consideration ( 7,110 ) Change in estimated fair value &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration as of December 31, 2022 $ 120 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we determined that the $ 7.0 million contingent consideration associated with our ezyVet acquisition in the second quarter of 2021 would be earned based on revenue achievements obtained. This amount was paid out during the second and third quarters of 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, we also issued a contingent payment related to a separate acquisition for approximately $ 0.1 million. \n\nNOTE 19. HEDGING INSTRUMENTS \n\nDisclosure within this note is presented to provide transparency about how and why we use derivative and non-derivative instruments (collectively &#8220;hedging instruments&#8221;), how the instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how the instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nWe are exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk that we currently manage by using hedging instruments is foreign currency exchange risk. We may also enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with borrowings under our variable-rate Credit Facility. \n\nOur subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, or foreign-denominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures, including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. \n\nThe primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions, including transactions denominated in euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. We also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with well-capitalized multinational financial institutions, and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. \n\nWe recognize all hedging instruments on the balance sheet at fair value at the balance sheet date. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment must be recorded at fair value through earnings. To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, cash flow and net investment hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows or fair value on hedged transactions. If the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in AOCI, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedging instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. We de-designate hedging instruments from \n\nF-43 \n\nhedge accounting when the likelihood of the hedged transaction occurring becomes less than probable. For de-designated instruments, the gain or loss from the time of de-designation through maturity of the instrument is recognized in earnings. Any gain or loss in AOCI at the time of de-designation is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Refer to &#8220;Note 21. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income&#8221; for further information regarding the effect of hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nWe enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions which permit certain outstanding receivables and payables to be offset in the event of default. Our derivative contracts do not require either party to post cash collateral. We elect to present our derivative assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. All cash flows related to our foreign currency exchange contracts are classified as operating cash flows, which is consistent with the cash flow treatment of the underlying items being hedged. &#160; \n\nRefer to &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Measurements&#8221; for additional information regarding the fair value of our derivative instruments and &#8220;Note 21. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income&#8221; for additional information regarding the effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of income. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nWe have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments mitigate the exposure to variability in the cash flows of forecasted transactions attributable to foreign currency exchange. Unless noted otherwise, we have also designated our derivative instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. \n\nWe did not de-designate any instruments from hedge accounting treatment during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Gains and losses related to hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material. At December 31, 2022, the estimated amount of net gains, net of tax, which are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI and into earnings within the next twelve months is $ 0.8 million if exchange rates do not fluctuate from the levels at December 31, 2022. \n\nWe target to hedge approximately 75 % to 85 % of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Australian dollar. We have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge. We primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months. Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year. As a result, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year. The U.S. dollar is the currency purchased or sold in all of our foreign currency exchange contracts. The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales totaled $ 258.2 million, and $ 286.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe following table presents the effect of cash flow hedge accounting on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, and provides information regarding the location and amounts of pretax gains or losses of derivatives: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) &#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Financial statement line items in which effects of cash flow hedges are recorded Cost of revenue $ 1,362,986 &#160; $ 1,325,928 &#160; $ 1,135,615 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income $ 25,733 &#160; $ ( 7,121 ) $ 829 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-44 \n\nNet Investment Hedges, Euro-Denominated Notes \n\nIn June 2015, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of &#8364; 88.9 million in euro-denominated 1.785 % Series C Senior Notes due June 18, 2025. We have designated these euro-denominated notes as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders&#8217; equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result of this designation, gains and losses from the change in translated U.S. dollar value of these euro-denominated notes are recorded in AOCI rather than to earnings. We recorded a gain of $ 4.5 million, a gain of $ 6.4 million, and a loss of $ 7.4 million, net of tax, within AOCI as a result of this net investment hedge for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The related cumulative unrealized gain recorded at December 31, 2022, will not be reclassified in earnings until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operations or all or a portion of the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. Refer to &#8220;Note 13. Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the issuance of these euro-denominated notes. \n\nNet Investment Hedges, Cross Currency Swaps \n\nWe have entered into several cross currency swap contracts as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations to offset foreign currency translation gains and losses on the net investment. These cross currency swaps have maturity dates beginning on June 30, 2023, through June 18, 2025. At maturity of the cross currency swap contracts, we will deliver the notional amounts of &#8364; 90.0 million and will receive approximately $ 104.5 million from the counterparties on June 30, 2023, and we will deliver the notional amount of &#8364; 15.0 million and will receive approximately $ 17.5 million from the counterparties on June 18, 2025. The change in fair value of the cross currency swap contracts are recorded in AOCI and will be reclassified to earnings when the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated. We recorded a gain of $ 3.8 million, a gain of $ 5.4 million, and a loss of $ 5.6 million, net of tax, within AOCI as a result of these net investment hedges, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We will receive quarterly interest payments from the counterparties based on a fixed interest rate until maturity of the cross currency swaps. This interest rate component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and, thus, is recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the hedge instrument. We recognized approximately $ 2.8 million and $ 2.8 million related to the excluded component as a reduction of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nFair Values of Hedging Instruments Designated as Hedges in Consolidated Balance Sheets \n\nThe fair values of hedging instruments, their respective classification on the consolidated balance sheets, and amounts subject to offset under master netting arrangements consisted of the following derivative instruments, unless otherwise noted: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) &#160; Hedging Assets &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; &#160; Derivatives and non-derivatives designated as hedging instruments Balance Sheet Classification &#160; &#160; Foreign currency exchange contracts Other current assets $ 5,185 &#160; $ 6,512 &#160; Cross currency swaps Other current assets 8,135 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Cross currency swaps Other long-term assets 1,127 &#160; 4,256 &#160; Total derivative instruments presented as hedge instruments on the balance sheet 14,447 &#160; 10,768 &#160; Gross amounts subject to master netting arrangements not offset on the balance sheet ( 3,210 ) ( 601 ) Net amount &#160; $ 11,237 &#160; $ 10,167 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-45 \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) &#160; Hedging Liabilities &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; &#160; Derivatives and non-derivatives designated as hedging instruments Balance Sheet Classification &#160; &#160; Foreign currency exchange contracts Accrued liabilities $ 4,572 &#160; $ 601 &#160; Total derivative instruments presented as cash flow hedges on the balance sheet 4,572 &#160; 601 &#160; \n\nNon-derivative foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedge on the balance sheet (1) \n\nLong-term debt 94,775 &#160; 100,711 &#160; Total hedging instruments presented on the balance sheet 99,347 &#160; 101,312 &#160; Gross amounts subject to master netting arrangements not offset on the balance sheet ( 3,210 ) ( 601 ) Net amount &#160; $ 96,137 &#160; $ 100,711 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts represent reported carrying amounts of our foreign currency denominated debt.

We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders, and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. As of December 31, 2022, there are approximate ly 3.0 million rem aining shares available for repurchase under this authorization. \n\nWe primarily acquire shares by repurchases in the open market. However, we also acquire shares that are surrendered by employees in payment for the minimum required statutory withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted stock units and the settlement of deferred stock units, otherwise referred to herein as employee surrenders. We issue shares of treasury stock upon the vesting of certain restricted stock units and upon the exercise of certain stock options. The number of shares of treasury stock issued during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was not material. \n\nThe following is a summary of our open market common stock repurchases, reported on a trade date basis, and shares acquired through employee surrenders: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands, except per share amounts) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; Shares repurchased in the open market 1,963 &#160; 1,283 &#160; 721 &#160; \n\nShares acquired through employee surrenders for statutory tax withholding \n\n21 &#160; 29 &#160; 58 &#160; Total shares repurchased 1,984 &#160; 1,312 &#160; 779 &#160; Cost of shares repurchased in the open market $ 810,942 &#160; $ 755,545 &#160; $ 179,623 &#160; Cost of shares for employee surrenders 10,606 &#160; 15,562 &#160; 20,603 &#160; Total cost of shares $ 821,548 &#160; $ 771,107 &#160; $ 200,226 &#160; Average cost per share - open market repurchases $ 413.12 &#160; $ 588.58 &#160; $ 249.20 &#160; Average cost per share - employee surrenders $ 501.89 &#160; $ 548.08 &#160; $ 354.98 &#160; Average cost per share - total $ 414.06 &#160; $ 587.70 &#160; $ 257.08 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-46 \n\nNOTE 21. &#160; ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME \n\nThe changes in AOCI, net of tax, consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Unrealized (Loss) Gain on Cash Flow Hedges, Net of Tax Unrealized (Loss) Gain on Net Investment Hedges, Net of Tax (in thousands) Unrealized (Loss) Gain on Investments, Net of Tax Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts Euro-Denominated Notes Cross Currency Swaps Defined Benefit Plans, Net of Tax Cumulative Translation Adjustment Total &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ ( 272 ) $ ( 9,934 ) $ ( 5,982 ) $ ( 2,159 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 35,268 ) $ ( 53,615 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 146 &#160; 9,139 &#160; 6,404 &#160; 5,399 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 26,731 ) ( 5,643 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income &#8212; &#160; 5,774 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5,774 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2021 ( 126 ) 4,979 &#160; 422 &#160; 3,240 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 61,999 ) ( 53,484 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications ( 46 ) 14,851 &#160; 4,525 &#160; 3,817 &#160; ( 3,282 ) ( 25,692 ) ( 5,827 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income &#8212; &#160; ( 18,991 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 506 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 18,485 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ ( 172 ) $ 839 &#160; $ 4,947 &#160; $ 7,057 &#160; $ ( 2,776 ) $ ( 87,691 ) $ ( 77,796 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents components and amounts reclassified out of AOCI to net income: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) Affected Line Item in the Statements of Income Amounts Reclassified from AOCI for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign currency exchange contracts Cost of revenue $ 25,733 &#160; $ ( 7,121 ) $ 829 &#160; Tax (expense) benefit ( 6,742 ) 1,347 &#160; ( 158 ) Gains (losses), net of tax $ 18,991 &#160; $ ( 5,774 ) $ 671 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Defined benefit plans Cost of revenue and operating expenses $ ( 605 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Tax benefit 99 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Losses, net of tax $ ( 506 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 22. &#160; PREFERRED STOCK \n\nOur Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $ 1.00 par value per share (&#8220;Preferred Stock&#8221;), in one or more series.

U.S. employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified percentages of their salaries. We match a portion of these contributions, not to exceed 5 % of participants&#8217; eligible compensation. We matched $ 28.3 million, $ 25.8 million, and $ 23.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In addition, we may make contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There were no discretionary contributions in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nWe also have established defined contribution plans for regional employees in Europe and in Canada. With respect to these plans, our contributions over the past three years have not been material. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Obligations \n\nOur Swiss defined benefit pension plans &#8220;(Swiss Plans&#8221;) are government-mandated retirement plans that provide employees with a minimum investment return. We account for our Swiss Plans in accordance with ASC 715-30, &#8220;Defined Benefit Plans - Pension.&#8221; As of December 31, 2022, our Swiss Plans had an unfunded net pension obligation of $ 4.0 million, with a fair value of plan assets of $ 12.5 million. The investments of the plan assets are measured using a mix of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $ 1.5 million in expense related to the Swiss Plans. The expense was reflected in cost of revenue, sales &#38; marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and research and development expense, based on employee classification. \n\nFuture
