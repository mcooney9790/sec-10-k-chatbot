Wood pulp generally comes from reforested trees and is purchased externally from a variety of sources, and acetic anhydride is an intermediate chemical that we produce from acetic acid in our intermediate chemistry business. Acetate flake is then further processed into acetate tow. \n\n&#8226; Customers \n\nOur intermediate chemistry business sells its products both directly to customers and through distributors. Acetic acid, VAM and acetic anhydride are global businesses, and we generally supply our customers under a mix of short- and long-term agreements. Acetic acid, VAM and acetic anhydride customers produce polymers used in water-based paints, adhesives, paper coatings, polyesters, film modifiers, pharmaceuticals, cellulose acetate and textiles. We have long-standing relationships with most of these customers. Solvents and derivatives are sold to a diverse group of regional and multinational customers under multi-year contracts and on the basis of long-standing relationships. Solvents and derivatives customers are primarily engaged in the production of paints, coatings and adhesives. We manufacture formaldehyde for our own use as well as for sale to a few regional customers. \n\nEmulsion, RDP and EVA polymers products are sold to a diverse group of regional, family owned and multinational customers. Customers of our emulsion polymers and RDP business are manufacturers of water-based paints and coatings, adhesives, paper, building and construction products, glass fiber, non-wovens, textiles and premixed dry mortars. Customers of our EVA polymers business are engaged in the manufacture of a variety of products, including hot melt adhesives, automotive components, thermal laminations, and flexible and food packaging materials. \n\nAcetate tow is sold principally to the major tobacco companies that account for a majority of worldwide cigarette production. Many sales are conducted under contracts with pricing for one or more years. As a result, margins may expand or contract in response to changes in market conditions over these similar periods, and we may be unable to adjust pricing due to other factors, such as the intense level of competition in the industry. \n\nPricing of our products within the Acetyl Chain segment is influenced by industry utilization, changes in the cost of raw materials, sensitivity to demand and the value-in-use. Therefore, in general, there is a direct correlation between these factors and our net sales for most Acetyl Chain products. This impact to pricing typically lags changes in raw material costs over months or quarters and impacts profit margins over those periods. \n\nSee Note 22 - Revenue Recognition in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nOther Activities \n\nOther Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs, including administrative activities such as finance, information technology and human resource functions, interest income and expense associated with our financing activities and results of our captive insurance companies. Our two wholly-owned captive insurance companies are a key component of our global risk management program, as well as a form of self-insurance for our liability, property and workers compensation risks. The captive insurance companies retain risk at levels approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk retained. Other Activities also includes the interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses components of our net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans, which are not allocated to our business segments.

KEPCO has polyacetal production facilities in Ulsan, South Korea, compounding facilities for PBT and nylon in Pyongtaek, South Korea, and participates with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a world-scale POM facility in Nantong, China. In December 2020, we signed a memorandum of understanding with our joint venture partners to restructure KEPCO, in which we and our joint venture partners will receive exclusive offtake rights to POM in Asia and global marketing rights without restrictions. On April 1, 2022, we completed the joint venture restructuring of KEPCO. As part of the restructuring of KEPCO, we paid KEPCO $5 million and will pay 5 equal annual installments of &#8364;24 million on October 1 of each year beginning in 2022. This resulted in an increase to our investment in KEPCO of $134 million. Our joint venture partner will be making similar payments to KEPCO. The restructuring did not result in a change in ownership percentage of KEPCO, nor a change in control, and KEPCO will continue to be accounted for as an equity method investment. \n\nFortron Industries, LLC. Fortron Industries LLC (\"Fortron\") is a leading global producer of PPS, sold under the Fortron &#174; brand, which is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications, especially those requiring heat and/or chemical resistance.

Neither Celanese nor any particular business segment is materially dependent upon any one patent, trademark, copyright or trade secret. \n\nEnvironmental and Other Regulation \n\nMatters pertaining to environmental and other regulations are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors , as well as Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies , Note 13 - Environmental and Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. \n\nWe expect to incur approximately $20 million to $40 million in capital expenditures for environmental control measures in each of 2023 and 2024. \n\nClimate Change \n\nClimate change is one of the most challenging and significant issues facing the world today, and we seek to do our part to make sustainable progress toward addressing this challenge. \n\nThe nature of our operations is energy and fossil fuel intensive. We have therefore invested in capital projects to increase energy efficiency, improve reliability, recover and reuse waste heat, and increase our purchase of renewable energy as well as more sustainable raw materials. These include a combined heat and power unit at our Lanaken, Belgium facility, a waste-to- \n\nenergy system in Nanjing, China, using solar energy at our Clear Lake, Texas facility designed for use by us and our onsite industrial partners, and a carbon dioxide capture and conversion to methanol project at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. \n\nWe are also focused on developing products to help our customers meet their sustainability goals. Examples include products for improving the sustainability of building and construction materials, adhesives, fiber coatings, flexible packaging, vehicle lightweighting and powering electric vehicles. We are also focused on making our own products from more sustainable sources, including increasing our offering products using biocertified content or recycled feedstocks. We believe these capabilities, together with trends such as the automobile industry's commitment towards improved energy efficiency and clean energy, present market opportunities for us. \n\nWith the fourth quarter 2022 publication of our 2021-2022 Sustainability Report, we have reported gross Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions for 2020 and 2021 using The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard , as a guide. Updated 2022 emissions figures were not available at the time of this filing. We have also announced a Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target described in our 2021-2022 Sustainability Report, obtained limited external assurance on our baseline 2021 environmental metrics, and are working to better understand where we can further reduce our GHG emissions sources and to integrate the M&#38;M Business into our GHG measurement and reporting processes. \n\nFor information on the risks we face related to climate change and other sustainability matters as well as, potential legislative and regulatory developments in this area that may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly, please see the risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors titled \"We are subject to financial, regulatory, physical risks and transition associated with climate change and other sustainability matters as well as potential legislation, regulation and international accords to address climate change and other sustainability matters,\" \"Changes in environmental, health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products\" and \"Our aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to risks.\" Climate-related regulatory risks are assessed as a part of our Enterprise Risk Management process. However, due to the level of uncertainty regarding what legislative or regulatory requirements may be enacted, it is not possible for us to estimate the impact of climate-related developments on our results of operations or financial conditions. \n\nHuman Capital Resources \n\nWorkforce Composition and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\nOur business is operated by a diverse and global workforce, with employees in the following key geographies: \n\n##TABLE_START Employees as of December 31, 2022 North America U.S. 4,722 Other North America 688 Total 5,410 &#160; Europe Germany 1,896 Other Europe 2,854 Total 4,750 &#160; Asia China 1,838 Other Asia 1,074 Total 2,912 &#160; Rest of World 191 &#160; Total 13,263 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe believe that providing a workplace that promotes mutual respect and inclusion for all employees is critical to our success and to driving innovation and growth. To that end, we continue to make progress in our efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in our Company. In order attract a diverse pipeline of talent, we engage with historically black colleges and universities (\"HBCUs\"), trade associations and other professional groups to broaden our candidate pool. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council elevates employee voice to inform activities that foster an inclusive environment for all. We promote engagement globally through 59 chapters of nine different Employee Resource Groups designed to inspire, develop and increase the visibility, representation and promotion of underrepresented groups. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022: \n\n&#8226; globally, women represent approximately 44% of our senior leadership team and 25% of our overall workforce; and \n\n&#8226; in the U.S., people of color represent approximately 13% of our senior leadership team and 30% of our overall workforce. \n\nThe following shows our attrition rate for the year ended December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Attrition Rate Employee Category Global employees 10.9 % Women (globally) 12.2 % People of Color (U.S.) 12.9 % ##TABLE_END\n\nStewardship: Health, Safety and Environmental \n\nWe focus on more than the occupational health and safety of our employees, contractors and any visitors to our sites. We have an expanded view and measurement of \"Stewardship\" that includes process safety and releases to the environment since these incidents may have an impact on the communities where we live and work. Our Stewardship values are critical to our success in attracting and retaining the best industry talent across the globe. \n\nWe strive to do no harm to people, the environment or the communities that host our facilities. We believe in continuous improvement in our Stewardship culture by building competency in our people and having a comprehensive management system built from recognized global practices. Our values include a commitment to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, communities and the environment. \n\nWe utilize a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the Stewardship performance of our operations. Lagging indicators for occupational health and safety include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR\") and the OSHA Lost Time Incident Rate (\"LTIR\") based upon the number of incidents per 200,000 work hours of both employees and contractors. Process Safety lagging indicators follow the industry standard from API RP 754 for Tier 1 and Tier 2 events for incident count, rate, and severity. The criteria for tracking release to the environment lagging indicators are 10% or greater of the Celanese reportable quantity (based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") methodology or internal values). Examples of Stewardship Tier 3 leading indicators include reporting and resolution of near miss events and hazard recognitions, all loss of primary containment releases and challenges to process safety systems. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a TRIR of 0.24 and a LTIR of 0.04, which includes two months of safety statistics from the M&#38;M Business. These statistics exclude COVID-19 related work place transmissions. Through deliberate actions, we have reduced our TRIR and LTIR rates by 23% and 69%, respectively, since 2017. \n\nRounding out our Stewardship performance in 2022, we had 11 Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety incidents and 9 releases to the environment above the 10% significant threshold. Any other loss of primary containment incidents, challenges to pressure relief systems, safety instrumented systems and safe operating limits are tracked as Tier 3 leading indicators. Our expanded tracking of leading indicator events helps identify potential emerging deficiencies that enables us to take continuous improvement actions. For example, this past year we concentrated heavily on improving our hazard identification and risk assessment and migration systems, hand safety awareness (the most commonly impacted body part) and establishing clear requirements regarding our fundamental life critical procedures and their field execution while focusing to prevent injuries with the most significant consequences. In 2023, the criteria for tracking release to the environment lagging indicators referenced above \n\nchanged from a Celanese based reportable quantity to a criteria that includes impact to the community and notification to a regulatory authority outside of routine communications. \n\nTalent Development \n\nWe are committed to fostering an engaging and inclusive workplace with opportunities for collaboration, development and leadership. Our Talent Management strategies provide a consistent and efficient approach to how we acquire talent, manage performance, develop bench strength, support development and help employees reach their fullest potential. \n\nWe have a structured approach to reviewing talent with management, as well as with the Board of Directors. This includes discussions of employee development, executive succession, diversity, talent pipelines and workforce planning requirements. We regularly report to the Board of Directors on talent management strategies across functional areas, and annually review executive succession with the Board of Directors. \n\nAvailable Information &#8212; Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Filings and Corporate Governance Materials \n\nWe make available free of charge, through the investor portion of our internet website (http://investors.celanese.com), our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as ownership reports on Form 3 and Form 4, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with, or furnishing it to, the SEC.

      "text": " Item 1A. &#160; Risk Factors \n\nThe following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock or outstanding senior notes could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. \n\nRisks Related to Business and Industry Conditions \n\nWe are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers. \n\nWe operate globally and have customers in many countries. Our major facilities are primarily located in North America, Europe and Asia, and we hold interests in affiliates that operate in the United States (\"U.S.\"), Germany, China, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Our principal customers are similarly global in scope and the prices of our most significant products are typically regional or world market prices. Consequently, our business and financial results are affected, directly and indirectly, by world economic conditions, including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, cost inflation, volatile exchange rates and other challenges such as the changing regulatory environment. \n\nOur operations are also subject to global political conditions. For example, any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements, or the failure to reach agreement over trade agreements, or the imposition of new or increased tariffs on our products or raw materials, or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like China, may increase costs or reduce profitability, or adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements, collect receivables, receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems. In certain foreign jurisdictions our operations are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of our contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. \n\nFurthermore, in certain cases where we benefit from local government subsidies or other undertakings, such benefits are subject to the solvency of local government entities and are subject to termination without meaningful recourse or remedies. \n\nWe have invested significant resources in China and other Asian countries. This region's growth may slow, or trade flows could be negatively impacted, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with our investment there and, consequently, our financial results may be adversely impacted. \n\nIn addition, we have significant operations and financial relationships based in Europe. Historically, sales originating in Europe have accounted for over one-third of our net sales annually, and accounted for approximately 35% of our Net sales in 2022. Adverse conditions in the European economy may negatively impact our overall financial results due to reduced economic growth, trade disruptions, decreased end-use customer demand or other factors. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with the increased volatility in the prices and availability of key raw materials and energy, which could have a significant adverse effect on the margins of our products and our financial results. \n\nWe purchase significant amounts of ethylene, methanol, carbon monoxide and natural gas from third parties primarily for use in our production of basic chemicals in our intermediate chemistry business, principally acetic acid, VAM and formaldehyde. We use a portion of our output of these chemicals, in turn, as inputs in the production of downstream products in all of our business segments. We also purchase some of these raw materials for use in our emulsion polymers and EVA polymer businesses, primarily for vinyl acetate ethylene emulsions and ethylene vinyl acetate production, as well as significant amounts of wood pulp for use in our production of acetate tow. We also procure polymers, rubber and polypropylene for use in production of engineered materials, and other raw materials as additives to our products including fiberglass, flame retardant materials and other compounding components. \n\nThe prices and availability of many of these items is dependent on supply and logistics considerations. Prices can increase significantly as a result of uncertainties associated with inflationary pressures, transportation or logistics disruptions, weather, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, the effects of climate change or political instability, plant or production disruptions, war or conflicts, strikes or other labor unrest, breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of raw materials and energy commodities, terrorist activities, civil unrest, or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant suppliers. In particular, to the extent of our vertical integration in the production of chemicals, shortages in the availability of raw material chemicals, such as natural gas, ethylene and methanol, or the loss of our dedicated supplies of carbon monoxide, may have an increased adverse impact on us as it can cause a shortage in intermediate and finished products. Such shortages would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and increase our costs resulting in reduced margins and adverse impacts to our financial results. \n\nLike many companies, we experienced supply disruptions and increased costs of inputs in 2021 and continuing into 2022. These trends have impacted our operating costs and we have undertaken efforts to offset these costs through pricing actions, alternative supply arrangements, and hedging strategies, however, these do not eliminate all exposure to inflationary pressure. We are not always successful passing costs to customers, competitive market conditions may prevent us from doing so, and even where we are successful increased prices could lead to reduced demand for our products or could result in competitive disadvantages. We currently expect these issues to continue into 2023. \n\nWe are exposed to volatility in the prices of our raw materials and energy. Although we have long-term supply agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts providing for the supply of ethylene, methanol, carbon monoxide, wood pulp, natural gas and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy can vary with economic conditions and may be highly volatile. In addition to the factors noted above that may impact supply or price, factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include: \n\n&#8226; Shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand, e.g., from growing uses or new uses; \n\n&#8226; Capacity constraints, e.g., due to construction delays, labor disruption, government-imposed work or travel restrictions, involuntary shutdowns or turnarounds; \n\n&#8226; A supplier's inability to meet our delivery orders, a supplier's decision not to fulfill orders or to terminate a supply contract or our inability to obtain or renew supply contracts on favorable terms; \n\n&#8226; The general level of business, economic and industry activity; and \n\n&#8226; The direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation (including the impact of government regulation relating to power usage, climate change or regulation of production and transport of certain chemicals). \n\nIf we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs, or if such commodities become unavailable, it could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to timely and profitably manufacture and deliver our products resulting in reduced margins, lost sales and adverse impacts to our financial results. \n\nWe have a practice of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for raw materials and services. However, some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials, such as carbon monoxide, steam and ethylene, or site services. Although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials and services, there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our ability to source raw materials or services in the future. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material or a service, there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier. Furthermore, if any sole source or major supplier were unable or unwilling to deliver a raw material or a service for an extended period of time, we may not be able to find an acceptable alternative or any such alternative could result in increased costs. It is also possible that profitability would be adversely affected if we were required to qualify additional sources of supply for a raw material or a service to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole source or major supplier. \n\nAlmost all of our supply of methanol in North America is currently obtained from our Fairway joint venture with Mitsui, in which we own a 50% interest, for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas. \n\nRisks Related to Our Global Operations and Our Strategy \n\nProduction at our manufacturing facilities, or at our suppliers', could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers' demands. \n\nA disruption in production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities, or our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, severe weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, public health crises (including, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic), disease, geopolitical events, strikes or other labor unrest, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our customers' needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. In particular, production disruptions at our manufacturing facilities that produce chemicals used as inputs in the production of chemicals in other business segments, such as acetic acid, VAM and formaldehyde, could have a more significant adverse effect on our business and financial performance and results of operations to the extent of such vertical integration. Furthermore, to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity, the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at such manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption. \n\nWe have experienced disruptions of the type described above in recent years. In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri led to worldwide supply disruptions, loss of energy and critical raw materials at our Texas sites and impacted nearly all of our employees in Texas, where we are headquartered and where several of our manufacturing sites are located. This storm led us to proactively and temporarily shut down our Texas production facilities in a controlled manner to protect our employees, communities, and assets, and the necessity of this decision led to lost production and negatively impacted our financial results for that quarter. In August 2020, to protect our employees and safeguard the assets at our Clear Lake facility, we temporarily, voluntarily ceased production at our Clear Lake, Texas facility during the landfall of Hurricane Laura. \n\nDisruptions or interruptions of production or operations could also occur due to accidents, interruptions in sources of raw materials, cybersecurity incidents, terrorism or political unrest, or other unforeseen events or delays in construction or operation of facilities, including as a result of geopolitical conditions, the occurrence of acts of war or terrorist incidents or as a result of weather, natural disasters, or other crises including public health crises. \n\nFailure to develop new products and production technologies or to implement productivity and cost reduction initiatives successfully, may harm our competitive position. \n\nOur operating results depend significantly on the development of commercially viable new products, product grades and applications, as well as improving process technologies. If we are unsuccessful in developing new products, applications and improved production processes in the future, including failing to leverage our opportunity pipeline in our Engineered Materials segment, our competitive position and operating results may be negatively affected. However, as we invest in new technology, \n\nwe face the risk of unanticipated operational or commercialization difficulties, including an inability to obtain necessary permits or governmental approvals, the development of competing technologies, failure of facilities or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations, construction delays, cost over-runs, the unavailability of financing, required materials or equipment and various other factors. Likewise, we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake initiatives in all of our business segments to improve productivity and performance and to generate cost savings. These initiatives may not be completed or beneficial or the estimated cost savings from such activities may not be realized. \n\nWe could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications. \n\nOur products provide important performance attributes to our customers' products. If one of our products fails to perform in a manner consistent with applicable quality specifications, a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed. A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more key customers. \n\nOur production facilities, including facilities we own and/or operate and operations at our facilities owned and/or operated by third parties, handle the processing of some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating and other risks that could have a negative effect on our operating results. \n\nAlthough we take precautions to enhance the safety of, and minimize the disruption to, our operations and operations at our facilities owned and/or operated by third parties, we are subject to operating and other risks associated with chemical manufacturing, including the storage and transportation of raw materials, finished products and waste. These risks include, among other things, pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures, explosions and fires and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances. In addition, we may have limited control over operations at our facilities owned and/or operated by third parties or such operations may not be fully integrated into our safety programs. \n\nThese operating and other risks can cause personal injury, property damage, third-party damages and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The occurrence of any of these events may disrupt production and have a negative effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, our operating results and cash flows. \n\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our rights to use our intellectual property. Our inability to protect and enforce these rights could reduce our ability to maintain our industry position and our profit margins. \n\nWe rely on our patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and trade secrets, and patents and other technology licensed from third parties, to protect our investment in research and development and our competitive commercial positions in manufacturing and marketing our products. We have adopted internal policies for protecting our know-how and trade secrets. In addition, our practice is to seek patent or trade secret protection for significant developments that provide us competitive advantages and freedom to practice for our businesses. Patents may cover catalysts, processes, products, intermediate products and product uses. These patents are usually filed in strategic countries throughout the world and provide varying periods and scopes of protection based on the filing date and the type of patent application. The legal life and scope of protection provided by a patent may vary among those countries in which we seek protection. As patents expire, the catalysts, processes, products, intermediate products and product uses described and claimed in those patents generally may become available for use by the public subject to our continued protection for associated know-how and trade secrets. We also monitor intellectual property of others, especially patents that could impact our rights to commercially implement research and development, our rights to manufacture and market our products, and our rights to use know-how and trade secrets. We will not intentionally infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of others, and we will continue to assess and take actions as necessary to protect our positions. We also seek to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our products, which brand names become more important once the corresponding product or process patents have expired. We operate in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce and our continued growth strategy may result in us seeking intellectual property protection in additional regions with similar challenges. We also monitor the trademarks of others and take action when our trademark rights are being infringed upon. If we are not successful in protecting or maintaining our patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property rights, or protecting our rights to commercially make, market and sell our products, our net sales, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. \n\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers, customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers, customers and business partners participate are cyclical in nature, both of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers' products. These risks include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, delays in or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Furthermore, some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the automotive, electrical, construction and textile industries, are highly competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use applications, and may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and the pricing of our products. In addition, many of these industries are highly cyclical in nature, thus posing risks to us that vary throughout the year and vary according to macroeconomic factors. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition. \n\nWe may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility. \n\nWe periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments, we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility. We also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised, we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations. The closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nThe insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks. \n\nWe maintain property, business interruption, casualty and cyber/information security insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In the future, the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost. \n\nRisks associated with our joint ventures, including differences in views with our joint venture partners may cause them not to operate according to their business plans, which may adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWe currently participate in a number of joint ventures, acquired interests in several additional joint ventures through the M&#38;M Acquisition and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint ventures require us to work cooperatively with unaffiliated third parties. Differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failure to agree on major decisions. Additionally, our partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations to the joint ventures, which could negatively impact them. If these risks cause the joint ventures to fail to achieve their desired operating performance, our results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\nOur significant non-U.S. operations expose us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact our profitability. \n\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the U.S. Consequently, fluctuations in currencies of other countries, especially the euro, may materially affect our operating results. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the cost of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions. These changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors. \n\nIn addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary's functional currency. Given the \n\nvolatility of exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and translation risks effectively. \n\nWe use financial instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, but those hedges in most cases cover existing balance sheet exposures and not future transactional exposures. We cannot guarantee that our hedging strategies will be effective. In addition, the use of financial instruments creates counterparty settlement risk. Failure to effectively manage these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nWe are subject to information or operational technology cybersecurity threats that could materially affect our business. \n\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to advanced and persistent threats in the areas of information and operational technology security and fraud. We seek to prevent unauthorized access to our information and operational technology systems and to detect and investigate any cybersecurity incidents that may occur, however in some cases we might be unaware of a particular incident or its magnitude and effects. We may face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. Additionally, we may be exposed to unauthorized access to our information or operational technology systems through undetected vulnerabilities in our service providers' information systems or software. These risks may be heightened as a result of our efforts to integrate the M&#38;M Business's technology environment with our own. \n\nThe theft, misuse or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information or the compromising of our systems or networks (including through ransomware or denial-of-service attacks) could harm our competitive position, cause operational disruption (including the potential to disrupt or compromise our control of physical plant operations at our manufacturing sites), reduce the value of our investment in research and development of new products and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. To the extent that any security breach impacts operations at our manufacturing sites, we may experience production or shipping disruptions. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees', customers' or vendors' confidential or personally identifiable information, we may incur liability or suffer reputational damage in the marketplace as a result. We maintain cyber/information security insurance, but any losses may be beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our policy. \n\nInformation and operational security threats and methods of perpetrating fraud or misappropriating information are constantly evolving and becoming more complex, which increases the difficulty and expense of defending against these threats. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including insurance, monitoring of our systems and networks, employee training, crisis simulations and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated advanced persistent threats that may have a material effect on our business. In addition, the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information or operational technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results. \n\nRisks Relating to the acquisition of the majority of the Mobility &#38; Materials business (the \"M&#38;M Acquisition\" and such business being acquired, the \"M&#38;M Business\") of DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (\"DuPont\") \n\nWe made certain assumptions relating to the M&#38;M Acquisition which may prove to be materially inaccurate and we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. \n\nWe made certain assumptions relating to the M&#38;M Acquisition, which may prove to be inaccurate. Expectations of future results may not materialize and we face risk of unanticipated or unknown issues or liabilities. Our mitigation strategies for such risks that are identified may be ineffective. We face risks and uncertainties regarding: \n\n&#8226; performance of the M&#38;M Business in future economic and business conditions; \n\n&#8226; the process of integrating the M&#38;M Business with ours, which may encounter unanticipated delays, costs or inefficiencies; \n\n&#8226; the amount and timing of potential benefits and synergies; \n\n&#8226; the amount of attention and resources needed to successfully align our and the M&#38;M Business's practices and operations including integrating commercial activities and technologies, retaining key personnel and aligning business cultures; \n\n&#8226; potential commercial, macroeconomic and financial risks associated with our broader international business footprint; and \n\n&#8226; other financial and strategic risks of the M&#38;M Acquisition. \n\nWe cannot guarantee that we will achieve our goals or meet our expectations with respect to the M&#38;M Acquisition. Through 2022, the M&#38;M Business underperformed prior expectations, in particular its financial performance from signing through the closing was lower than anticipated. We cannot be certain when we will be able to realize improvements in the underlying M&#38;M Business performance and as we proceed with integration, we may identify additional risks and challenges. The benefits of the M&#38;M Acquisition, including the anticipated financial benefits and the synergies and growth opportunities, may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. If our assumptions are inaccurate or we are unable to meet our expectations (including our expectations regarding financial targets), our business, financial performance and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the M&#38;M Acquisition. \n\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with completing the M&#38;M Acquisition, combining the operations of our business and the M&#38;M Business and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. Non-recurring expenses include, among others, employee retention costs, fees paid to financial, legal, integration and accounting advisors, severance and benefit costs. We will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We will continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the M&#38;M Acquisition and the integration of the M&#38;M Business into our business. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the M&#38;M Business, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. \n\nThe risk of non-compliance with non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives. \n\nThe M&#38;M Acquisition introduces us into a number of new geographic markets, subjecting us to additional non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies which do not currently apply to us, and will increase our exposure to certain other geographic markets as well as their laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have become more stringent over time, could increase our cost of doing business, and could result in conflicting legal requirements. Therefore, the M&#38;M Acquisition may increase our exposure to the risks described below under \"Regulatory, Legal, Environmental and Tax Risks.\" \n\nRegulatory, Legal, Environmental and Tax Risks \n\nFailure to comply with applicable laws or regulations and/or changes in applicable laws or regulations may adversely affect our business and financial results as a whole. \n\nWe are subject to extensive international, national, state, local and other laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, including antitrust, anticorruption and sanctions laws, rules, regulations or court decisions, could expose us to fines, penalties and other costs. For example, in December 2019 we announced the recording of a reserve in connection with a competition law investigation by the European Commission based on certain past ethylene purchases by certain subsidiaries of the Company, and in July 2020, we announced that we had reached a final settlement of $92 million with respect to this investigation. The Company paid this settlement in full on January 12, 2021. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and employee training designed to ensure compliance with these laws, rules, regulations and court decisions, there can be no assurance that our employees and business partners and other third parties acting on our behalf will comply with these laws, rules, regulations and court decisions, which could result in fines, penalties and costs and damage to our business reputation. \n\nMoreover, changes in laws or regulations, including the more aggressive enforcement of such laws and regulations, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements (including trade compliance requirements), or changes in reporting requirements of the U.S., Canadian, Mexican, German, EU or Asian governmental agencies, could increase the cost of doing business in these regions. In addition, enforcement of environmental or other governmental policy may result in plant shut downs or significantly decreased production, such as in China on high pollution days. For example, in 2021 we experienced energy curtailment mandates from the government in the Chinese province where our Nanjing production facility is located, \n\nwhich forced us to reduce and curtail production at that site. Any of these types of conditions, including the failure to obtain or maintain operating permits for our business, may have an effect on our business and financial results as a whole and may result in volatile current and future prices for our products and raw materials. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability, warranty, and tort claims, and recalls, which could adversely affect our financial condition and performance. \n\nThe development, manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products by us, including products produced for the food and beverage, medical device, pharmaceutical, automobile, construction, appliance, cigarette and aerospace end markets, involves a risk of exposure to product liability, warranty, and tort claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. A product liability, warranty, or tort claim or judgment against us that is larger than those typically experienced in the regular course of business could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect consumer or customer confidence in our products, and divert management's attention from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a significant partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Although we have standard contracting policies and controls, we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls. \n\nEnvironmental regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines, clean-ups and other damages, require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs. \n\nCosts related to our compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and potential obligations with respect to sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us, may have a negative impact on our operating results. We also have obligations related to the indemnity agreement contained in the demerger and transfer agreement between Celanese GmbH and Hoechst AG for environmental matters arising out of certain divestitures that took place prior to the demerger. See Note 13 - Environmental in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nOur operations are subject to extensive international, national, state, local and other laws and regulations that govern environmental, health and safety matters and that regulate the handling, manufacture, use, emission and disposal of products, materials and hazardous and non-hazardous waste. If we violate any one of those laws or regulations, we can be held liable for substantial fines and other sanctions, including limitations on our operations as a result of changes to or revocations of environmental permits involved. We could also face claims for damages from individuals or groups for alleged violations of these laws or regulations. \n\nWe also incur substantial capital and other costs to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and regulations could result in substantial additional costs and liabilities to us or limitations on our operations. Consequently, compliance with these laws and regulations may negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in a particular reporting period. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information. \n\nFor more information on risks we face specifically related to climate change and related potential regulation, see the risk factor titled \"We are subject to financial, regulatory, physical and transition risks associated with climate change or other sustainability matters as well as potential legislation, regulation and international accords to address climate change and other sustainability matters\" below. \n\nChanges in environmental, health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for our products. \n\nNew or revised governmental regulations, independent studies or consumer or societal perceptions relating to the effect of our products on health, safety or the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products. In addition, products we produce, including VAM, formaldehyde and polymers derived from formaldehyde, may be classified and labeled in a manner that would adversely affect demand for such products. For example, in 2019 the EPA designated formaldehyde as a high-priority substance under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the substance is currently undergoing risk evaluation. In addition, in 2012 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (\"IARC\"), a research agency within the World Health Organization, classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) based on epidemiological studies linking formaldehyde exposure to nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare cancer in humans, and leukemia. In 2011, a similar conclusion \n\nwas reached by the National Toxicology Program (\"NTP\"), a U.S. inter-agency research program. We anticipate that the results of the IARC's and the NTP's reviews will continue to be examined and considered by government regulatory agencies with responsibility for setting worker and environmental exposure standards and labeling requirements. \n\nOther initiatives, including the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability initiative currently to be undertaken by the EU as part of the Green Deal will potentially require, or increase existing requirements for, toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional regulatory requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling and/or use of the subject chemicals. The new requirements may necessitate reformulation of products in order to meet customers' demands, which would be a financially burdensome process. \n\nSuch concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to financial, regulatory, physical and transition risks associated with climate change or other sustainability matters as well as potential legislation, regulation and international accords to address climate change and other sustainability matters. \n\nGreenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions have become the subject of significant international, national, regional, state and local attention. For example, the EPA and SEC have promulgated or proposed extensive rules concerning reporting of GHG emissions. The European Commission has also embarked on the European Green Deal initiative with the goal of making the EU carbon neutral by 2050, which is leading to additional statutory and regulatory requirements. In addition, regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations, statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation intended to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. Compliance with such legislation, regulation and accords and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches and standards to the regulation of climate change. \n\nA number of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing GHG emissions, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. Some jurisdictions have emissions reduction measures directed at the power or oil and gas sectors, which could result in higher power input costs or reduced energy availability for us. Other regulations that are being implemented or contemplated include the potential for restrictions on GHG emissions, cap and trade emissions trading systems, taxes on GHG emissions, fuel, and energy, or carbon import charges on certain products among other provisions. These may exist in addition to country and corporate-level net-zero GHG emissions pledges. These measures, if and where enacted, may significantly increase our costs of operations or require us to incur significant additional capital costs for the installation of equipment to mitigate GHG emissions for our sites' manufacturing operations. \n\nPhysical impacts of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and floods and impact on sea levels, may also impact our facilities and operations and those of our key suppliers. A number of our sites are located in areas that are exposed to weather events and changing sea levels (such as the Texas Gulf Coast) and that have been impacted by hurricanes and other weather events in the past as described elsewhere in these risk factors. To the extent climate change exacerbates these threats, our operations and supply chains could experience increased levels of disruptions and added costs. \n\nAdditionally, increased social, legislative and regulatory focus on climate change and other sustainability matters as well as customer demand for responsibly manufactured products could lead to changes in the behavior of our customers or their end-customers, and could result in reduced customer demand for products made from materials that are perceived to be significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change. We may fail to accurately react to these trends and refine our product offerings through innovation, or we may not be able to fully address these concerns through changes in manufacturing methods or use of more sustainable materials and processes, which could result in reduced demand for our products. \n\nWe closely monitor developments in this area, but there is significant uncertainty regarding what legislative or regulatory requirements may be put in place, which makes it impossible for us to predict the longer-term impact these measures have on our operations. However, we believe that future legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change are likely, which could materially increase operating costs in the chemical industry and thereby increase our manufacturing and delivery costs. \n\nOur aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to risks. \n\nWe have developed and publicized, and expect to continue to establish, goals, targets, and other objectives related to sustainability matters. These include a GHG intensity reduction target and other environmental targets. Such statements reflect our current plans at the time they are made, and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our ability to track and meet these goals depends on future innovations and technology and the availability of accurate reporting methods. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives could expose us to operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective is and will be subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control, such as evolving regulatory or quasi-regulatory sustainability standards, the ability of suppliers to meet our sustainability and other standards, differing requirements and the pace of changes in technology. \n\nWe may face increased scrutiny from the investment community, other stakeholders, regulators, and the media related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, ability to attract or retain employees, and attractiveness as an investment, business partner, or as an acquirer could be negatively impacted, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results of operations. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines that we announce, or at all, could have the same negative impacts, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. Even if we achieve the goals, targets, and objectives we set, we may not realize all of the benefits that it expected at the time they were established. \n\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings. \n\nWe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. The outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of such proceedings, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period. See Note 13 - Environmental and Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nChanges in, or the interpretation of, tax legislation or rates throughout the world, or the resolution of tax examinations or audits, could materially impact our results. \n\nOur future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the European Commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates EU state aid rules. \n\nFurthermore, a number of countries where we do business, including the U.S. and many countries in the EU, have changed or are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, expirations of tax holidays or rulings, changes in the assessment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. The increasingly complex global tax environment and related legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nFor example, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (the \"OECD\"), which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting initiatives, which focus on a number of issues, including (i) the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions and (ii) a global minimum tax of at least 15% of adjusted financial statement income, applied on a country by country basis, applicable to multinational groups with annual adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1.0 billion. The adoption of such changes is contingent upon the independent actions of participating countries to enact implementing domestic legislation. \n\nFurthermore, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\"IRA\") was enacted in the U.S. The IRA created a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of consolidated GAAP pre-tax income for corporations with three-year average annual book income in excess of $1.0 billion. The IRA also created an excise tax of 1% of the value of any stock repurchased by us after December 31, 2022. \n\nWe are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. Examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place. \n\nOur tax returns are under audit for the years 2013 through 2015 by the United States, the Netherlands and Germany. These authorities have proposed adjustments to transfer pricing and the reallocation of income between the related jurisdictions to open tax years through 2019. While we have reached resolution with the Netherlands, we are currently continuing with the other taxing authorities and are evaluating all potential remedies. We are currently evaluating these proposals and all potential remedies. If this matter is resolved in a manner inconsistent with our expectations or we are unsuccessful in defending our position, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted. \n\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of tax examinations or audits. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. It is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in future periods. \n\nRisks Related to Our Human Capital \n\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management. \n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team. The inability to recruit and retain talented employees or the unexpected loss of such talented employees or key personnel may adversely affect our operations. Like many companies, we have experienced in the last couple of years and continue to experience an increasingly competitive hiring environment for skilled employees at our manufacturing and other sites, which in some cases has increased, or may in the future increase, the cost of retaining or hiring talented employees, particularly in technical manufacturing roles critical to our success. \n\nIn addition, we rely on our senior management team specifically, therefore our future success depends in part on our ability to retain those members of senior management and to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The hiring and retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategies. \n\nSignificant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost. \n\nThe cost of our pension plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time. Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions, which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations. The combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. In recent years, an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates. If the funded status of a \n\npension plan declines, we may be required to make unscheduled contributions in addition to those contributions for which we have already planned. See Note 12 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nSome of our employees are unionized, represented by workers councils or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 13,263 employees globally. Approximately 11% of our 4,722 U.S.-based employees are unionized. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other employment rights than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor agreements. Most of our employees in Europe are represented by workers councils and/or unions that must approve any changes in terms and conditions of employment, including potentially salaries and benefits. They may also impede efforts to restructure our workforce. Although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives, a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown by our employees could occur, resulting in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs. \n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness \n\nFinancing the M&#38;M Acquisition significantly increased our indebtedness and interest expense, which could adversely affect us, decrease our business flexibility, diminish our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the chemicals industry. \n\nSee Note 11 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our indebtedness. See Note 12 - Benefit Obligations , Note 13 - Environmental and Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our other obligations. \n\nWe incurred approximately $11.0 billion of indebtedness to finance the M&#38;M Acquisition, bringing our total outstanding indebtedness to $14.7 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Also, the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness, and thus the demands on our cash resources, has significantly increased as a result of the indebtedness to finance the M&#38;M Acquisition. \n\nWe intend to allocate capital to repay and reduce our outstanding debt using cash from operations and potentially proceeds from asset sales or dispositions if we are able to do so on favorable terms. Our ability to reduce our level of indebtedness over time in line with our strategic goals depends on a number of factors including our business performance, macroeconomic and industry conditions, commercial and financing market conditions, and other factors described in these risk factors, and our inability to achieve these objectives could delay or alter our deleveraging plan, or could negatively impact the trading prices of our securities or our credit ratings. \n\nOur higher level of indebtedness and other liabilities could have other important consequences, including: \n\n&#8226; Increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including exacerbating the impact of any adverse business effects that could impact our ability to repay amounts due under existing senior credit agreements (the \"Credit Agreements\") or our indentures (the \"Indentures\") governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\"); \n\n&#8226; Requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness and amounts payable in connection with the satisfaction of our other liabilities, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends on our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"); \n\n&#8226; Reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions; \n\n&#8226; Exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; \n\n&#8226; Exposing us to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates as certain of our borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies; and \n\n&#8226; Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes. \n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. \n\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets on unfavorable terms, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to complete those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. \n\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions and may diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or pay dividends. \n\nThe Credit Agreements, the Indentures and the Receivables Purchase Agreement governing our receivables securitization facility each contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. The Credit Agreements and the Indentures contain covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt; incur liens securing debt; merge or consolidate with any other person; and sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Issuer's assets or the assets of certain subsidiaries. Additionally, the Credit Agreements require the maintenance of certain financial ratios. \n\nSuch restrictions in our debt obligations could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders and holders of the Senior Notes in order to take certain actions. Disruptions in credit markets may prevent us from obtaining or make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain such consents. Our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consents. \n\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, a default under any of the Credit Agreements could permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under such Credit Agreement and to terminate any commitments to lend. If the lenders under any Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay such amounts or our other indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. In such event, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. \n\nCelanese and Celanese U.S. are holding companies and depend on subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of Celanese U.S.'s obligations under the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreements by Celanese. \n\nAs holding companies, Celanese and Celanese U.S. conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries, which own substantially all of our consolidated assets. Consequently, the principal source of cash to pay Celanese and Celanese U.S.'s obligations, including obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of Celanese U.S.'s obligations under the Credit Agreements and the Indentures by Celanese, is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations. We cannot assure that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable Celanese U.S. and/or Celanese to make payments in respect of their obligations. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable country or state laws, regulatory limitations and terms of our debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries' ability to distribute cash to Celanese U.S. and Celanese. In the event Celanese U.S. and/or Celanese do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, Celanese U.S. and/or Celanese may be unable to make required payments on the indebtedness under the Credit Agreements, the Indentures, the guarantee of Celanese U.S.'s obligations under the Credit Agreements and the Indentures by Celanese, or our other indebtedness. \n\n"

Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities \n\nMarket Information \n\nOur common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"), has traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"CE\" since January 21, 2005. \n\nHolders \n\nAs of February 10, 2023, there were 111 holders of record of our Common Stock. A substantially greater number of holders of our common stock are \"street name\" or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions. \n\nDividend Policy \n\nThe amount available to us to pay cash dividends is not currently restricted by our existing senior credit facilities and our indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. Also, the general corporation law of the State of Delaware imposes restrictions on the payment of dividends by all Delaware corporations that do not currently limit our ability to pay our current and anticipated regular cash dividends. See Note 14 - Shareholders' Equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nCelanese Purchases of its Equity Securities \n\nWe did not repurchase any Common Stock during the three months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of $6.9 billion of our Common Stock since February 2008, with approximately $1.1 billion value of shares remaining that may be purchased under the program. See Note 14 - Shareholders' Equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nPerformance Graph \n\nThe following performance graph compares the cumulative total return on Celanese Corporation Common Stock from December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022 to that of the Standard &#38; Poor's (\"S&#38;P\") 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Chemicals Index. Cumulative total return represents the change in stock price and the amount of dividends received during the indicated period, assuming reinvestment of all dividends. The performance graph assumes an investment of $100 on December 31, 2017. The stock performance shown in the graph is included in response to SEC requirements and is not intended to forecast or to be indicative of future performance. \n\nComparison of Cumulative Total Return \n\nThe above performance graph and related information shall not be deemed \"soliciting material\" or to be \"filed\" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing. \n\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities \n\nOur deferred compensation plan offers certain of our senior employees and directors the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation in exchange for a future payment amount equal to their deferments plus or minus certain amounts based upon the market-performance of specified measurement funds selected by the participant. These deferred compensation obligations may be considered securities of Celanese. Participants were required to make deferral elections under the plan prior to January 1 of the year such deferrals will be withheld from their compensation. We relied on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in making this offer to a select group of employees, fewer than 35 of which were non-accredited investors under the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n"

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Annual Report\"), the term \"Celanese\" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us,\" refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The term \"Celanese U.S.\" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries. \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). \n\nInvestors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this section and other parts of this Annual Report involve both risk and uncertainty. Several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond the control of management. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. \n\nForward-Looking Statements \n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&#38;A\") and other parts of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. Generally, words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"can,\" \"could,\" \"might,\" and \"will,\" and similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views and beliefs with respect to future events at the time that the statements are made, are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. See \" Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \" at the beginning of this Annual Report for further discussion. All forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report are made as of the date hereof, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from expectations expressed in this Annual Report will increase with the passage of time. We undertake no obligation, and disclaim any duty, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in our expectations or otherwise. \n\nRisk Factors \n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report also contains a description of certain risk factors that you should consider which could significantly affect our financial results. In addition, the following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements: \n\n&#8226; changes in general economic, business, political and regulatory conditions in the countries or regions in which we operate; \n\n&#8226; volatility or changes in the price and availability of raw materials and energy, particularly changes in the demand for, supply of, and market prices of ethylene, methanol, natural gas, wood pulp and fuel oil and the prices for electricity and other energy sources; \n\n&#8226; the length and depth of product and industry business cycles particularly in the automotive, electrical, textiles, electronics and construction industries; \n\n&#8226; the ability to pass increases in raw material prices, logistics costs and other costs on to customers or otherwise improve margins through price increases; \n\n&#8226; the accuracy or inaccuracy of our beliefs or assumptions regarding anticipated benefits of the acquisition (the \"M&#38;M Acquisition\") by us of the majority of the Mobility &#38; Materials business (the \"M&#38;M Business\") of DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (\"DuPont\"), including as a result of the performance of the M&#38;M Business between signing and closing of the M&#38;M Acquisition; \n\n&#8226; the possibility that we will not be able to realize anticipated improvements in the M&#38;M Business's financial performance &#8211; including optimizing pricing, currency mix and inventory &#8211; or realize the anticipated benefits of the M&#38;M Acquisition, including synergies and growth opportunities, within the anticipated timeframe or at all, whether as a result of difficulties \n\narising from the operation or integration of the M&#38;M Business or other unanticipated delays, costs, inefficiencies or liabilities; \n\n&#8226; increased commercial, legal or regulatory complexity of entering into, or expanding our exposure to, certain end markets and geographies; \n\n&#8226; risks in the global economy and equity and credit markets and their potential impact on our ability to pay down debt in the future and/or refinance at suitable rates, in a timely manner, or at all; \n\n&#8226; diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities and other disruption caused by the M&#38;M Acquisition and the integration processes and their impact on our existing business and relationships; \n\n&#8226; risks and costs associated with increased leverage from the M&#38;M Acquisition, including increased interest expense and potential reduction of business and strategic flexibility; \n\n&#8226; the ability to maintain plant utilization rates and to implement planned capacity additions, expansions and maintenance; \n\n&#8226; the ability to reduce or maintain current levels of production costs and to improve productivity by implementing technological improvements to existing plants; \n\n&#8226; increased price competition and the introduction of competing products by other companies; \n\n&#8226; the ability to identify desirable potential acquisition or divestiture opportunities and to complete such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals, consistent with our strategy; \n\n&#8226; market acceptance of our products and technology; \n\n&#8226; compliance and other costs and potential disruption or interruption of production or operations due to accidents, interruptions in sources of raw materials, transportation, logistics or supply chain disruptions, cybersecurity incidents, terrorism or political unrest, public health crises (including, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic), or other unforeseen events or delays in construction or operation of facilities, including as a result of geopolitical conditions, the occurrence of acts of war (such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict) or terrorist incidents or as a result of weather, natural disasters, or other crises; \n\n&#8226; the ability to obtain governmental approvals and to construct facilities on terms and schedules acceptable to us; \n\n&#8226; changes in applicable tariffs, duties and trade agreements, tax rates or legislation throughout the world including, but not limited to, adjustments, changes in estimates or interpretations or the resolution of tax examinations or audits that may impact recorded or future tax impacts and potential regulatory and legislative tax developments in the United States and other jurisdictions; \n\n&#8226; changes in the degree of intellectual property and other legal protection afforded to our products or technologies, or the theft of such intellectual property; \n\n&#8226; potential liability for remedial actions and increased costs under existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations, including those relating to climate change or other sustainability matters; \n\n&#8226; potential liability resulting from pending or future claims or litigation, including investigations or enforcement actions, or from changes in the laws, regulations or policies of governments or other governmental activities, in the countries in which we operate; \n\n&#8226; changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates; and \n\n&#8226; various other factors, both referenced and not referenced in this Annual Report. \n\nMany of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond our control. COVID-19 and responses to the pandemic by governments and businesses, have significantly increased financial, economic and cost volatility and uncertainty, exacerbating the risks and potential impact of these factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, affect us in ways or to an extent that we currently do not expect or consider to be significant, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. We neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nFinancial Highlights \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change (In $ millions, except percentages) Statement of Operations Data Net sales 9,673 8,537 1,136 Gross profit 2,380 2,682 (302) Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&#38;A\") expenses \n\n(824) (633) (191) Other (charges) gains, net (8) 3 (11) Operating profit (loss) 1,378 1,946 (568) Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates 220 146 74 Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit (expense) income \n\n17 106 (89) Interest expense (405) (91) (314) Interest income 69 8 61 Dividend income - equity investments 133 147 (14) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before tax 1,421 2,248 (827) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations 1,910 1,918 (8) Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations (8) (22) 14 Net earnings (loss) 1,902 1,896 6 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation 1,894 1,890 4 Other Data Depreciation and amortization 462 371 91 SG&#38;A expenses as a percentage of Net sales 8.5 &#160;% 7.4 &#160;% \n\nOperating margin (1) \n\n14.2 &#160;% 22.8 &#160;% Other (charges) gains, net Restructuring (6) (5) (1) Asset impairments (14) (2) (12) Plant/office closures 12 10 2 Total Other (charges) gains, net (8) 3 (11) ##TABLE_END\n\n_____________________________ \n\n(1) Defined as Operating profit (loss) divided by Net sales. \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 2021 (In $ millions) Balance Sheet Data Cash and cash equivalents 1,508 536 Short-term borrowings and current installments of long-term debt - third party and affiliates 1,306 791 Long-term debt, net of unamortized deferred financing costs 13,373 3,176 Total debt 14,679 3,967 ##TABLE_END\n\nFactors Affecting Business Segment Net Sales \n\nThe percentage increase (decrease) in Net sales attributable to each of the factors indicated for each of our business segments is as follows: \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 \n\n##TABLE_START Volume Price Currency Total (In percentages) Engineered Materials 33 23 (8) 48 Acetyl Chain (6) 6 (3) (3) Total Company 6 11 (4) 13 ##TABLE_END\n\nConsolidated Results \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nNet sales increased $1.1 billion, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; higher pricing in both of our segments, primarily driven by our Engineered Materials segment, due to higher raw material costs, higher energy costs and product mix; and \n\n&#8226; higher volume in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily in elastomers related to our acquisition of the majority of the Mobility &#38; Materials business (the \"M&#38;M Business\"), our acquisition of the Santoprene&#8482; thermoplastic vulcanizates elastomers business of Exxon Mobil Corporation (\"Santoprene\"), as well as the Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd., (\"KEPCO\") restructuring; \n\npartially offset by: \n\n&#8226; an unfavorable currency impact resulting from a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar; and \n\n&#8226; lower volume in our Acetyl Chain segment, primarily due to decreased demand in Asia. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $191 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; higher functional and project spending of $187 million in Other Activities, primarily related to our acquisitions of the M&#38;M Business and Santoprene. \n\nOperating profit decreased $568 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; higher raw material and energy costs in both of our segments; \n\n&#8226; higher spending in both of our segments, primarily as a result of our acquisitions of the M&#38;M Business and Santoprene, as well as increased plant operating and maintenance expenses; and \n\n&#8226; lower Net sales in our Acetyl Chain segment; \n\npartially offset by: \n\n&#8226; higher Net sales in our Engineered Materials segment. \n\nNon-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit income decreased $89 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in recognized actuarial loss of $40 million as a result of lower than expected actual asset returns, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from 2.5% to 4.9% and a decrease in expected asset returns of $39 million. See Note 12 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nOur effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was (34)% compared to 15% for the year ended 2021. The lower effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to the reorganization of our foreign legal entity holding structure and relocation of certain of our intangible assets to align with the acquired M&#38;M Business foreign operations. See Note 15 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nDiscussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, can be found in Part II - Item 7.

See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information; and \n\n&#8226; higher pricing for most of our products, primarily due to higher raw material costs, higher energy costs and product mix; \n\npartially offset by: \n\n&#8226; an unfavorable currency impact resulting from a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar. \n\nOperating profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; higher Net sales; \n\nlargely offset by: \n\n&#8226; higher raw material costs for all of our products and increased sourcing costs as a result of higher logistical costs and global shipping constraints and our acquisition of the M&#38;M Business; \n\n&#8226; higher spending of $258 million, primarily as a result of our acquisitions of the M&#38;M Business and Santoprene, as well as plant operating and administrative expenses; and \n\n&#8226; higher energy costs of $124 million, primarily for steam. \n\nEquity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates increased for the for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase in equity investment in earnings of $90 million from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate, primarily as a result of tighter market conditions and stronger demand. \n\nAcetyl Chain \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, % 2022 2021 Change Change (In $ millions, except percentages) Net sales 5,743 5,894 (151) (2.6) % Net Sales Variance Volume (6) &#160;% Price 6 &#160;% Currency (3) &#160;% Operating profit (loss) 1,447 1,875 (428) (22.8) % Operating margin 25.2 % 31.8 &#160;% Dividend income - equity investments 132 146 (14) (9.6) % Depreciation and amortization \n\n213 210 3 1.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nNet sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; lower volume for most of our products due to decreased demand, primarily in Asia; and \n\n&#8226; an unfavorable currency impact resulting from a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar; \n\npartially offset by: \n\n&#8226; higher pricing for most of our products, primarily due to tighter market conditions as a result of increased customer demand in the Western Hemisphere and supply constraints across most regions; and \n\n&#8226; higher volume for VAM due to increased demand. \n\nOperating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; higher raw material and sourcing costs, primarily for methanol and carbon monoxide due to stronger demand and tighter market conditions, as well as higher distribution costs due to global shipping constraints; \n\n&#8226; lower Net sales; \n\n&#8226; higher energy costs of $89 million, primarily due to price increases for natural gas and electricity; and \n\n&#8226; higher spending of $53 million, primarily as a result of increased plant operating and maintenance expenses. \n\nOther Activities \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, % 2022 2021 Change Change (In $ millions, except percentages) Operating profit (loss) \n\n(498) (340) (158) (46.5) % Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit (expense) income \n\n17 106 (89) (84.0) % ##TABLE_END\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nOperating loss increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; higher functional and project spending of $187 million, primarily related to our acquisitions of the M&#38;M Business and Santoprene; \n\npartially offset by: \n\n&#8226; lower incentive compensation cost. \n\nNon-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase in recognized actuarial loss of $40 million as a result of lower than expected actual asset returns, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from 2.5% to 4.9%, and a decrease in expected asset returns of $39 million. See Note 12 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, we have $1.45 billion available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations. In addition, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. We are actively managing our business to maintain cash flow, and we believe that liquidity from the above-referenced sources will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future. \n\nOn November 1, 2022, we acquired a majority of the M&#38;M Business for a purchase price of $11.0 billion, subject to transaction adjustments, in an all-cash transaction. For further information regarding the acquisition and related financing transactions, see Debt and Other Obligations in this Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nWhile our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt service, for the next twelve months. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels. \n\nCapital expenditures were $543 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We continue to prioritize those projects expected to drive productivity in the near-term and expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million in 2023, primarily due to certain investments in growth opportunities and productivity improvements. In Engineered Materials, our expansion of (1) the compounding capacity and (2) the new liquid crystal polymer (\"LCP\") unit at our facilities in Nanjing, China are, after experiencing some delays due to certain permitting issues, in detailed engineering design and our (3) energy optimization productivity project at our polyoxymethylene (\"POM\") unit in Frankfurt, Germany is in front end engineering design. In the Acetyl Chain, our planned expansion of (1) the capacity of our vinyl acetate ethylene (\"VAE\") emulsions units in Nanjing, China, (2) the capacity of our vinyl acetate monomer (\"VAM\") plant in Bay City, Texas, (3) the sustainable \n\nproduction of methanol at our Fairway joint venture methanol unit in Clear Lake, Texas using captured carbon dioxide as feedstock, (4) our acetic acid complex expansion in Clear Lake, Texas and (5) our VAE emulsion plant expansion in Frankfurt, Germany, are in various stages of construction and on schedule. We continue to see the incremental capacity from investments made in recent years strengthen our manufacturing network reliability to best serve our customers. \n\nWe did not repurchase any Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nOn a stand-alone basis, Celanese and its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, Celanese U.S., have no independent external operations of their own. Accordingly, they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to Celanese and Celanese U.S. in order to meet their obligations, including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes, and to pay dividends on our Common Stock. \n\nWe are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate, such as China, India and Indonesia. Capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies, repatriate earnings or capital, lend via intercompany loans or create cross-border cash pooling arrangements. Our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in China. Pursuant to applicable regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the Chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of China, puts certain limitations on duration, purpose and amount of intercompany loans, and restricts cross-border cash pooling. While it is possible that future tightening of these restrictions or application of new similar restrictions could impact us, these limitations do not currently restrict our operations. \n\nWe remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expect to remain in compliance based on our current expectation of future results of operations. If our actual future results of operations differ materially from these expectations, or if we otherwise experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower EBITDA, we may be required to seek an amendment or waiver of such covenants which may increase our borrowing costs under those debt instruments. \n\nCash Flows \n\nCash and cash equivalents increased $972 million to $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, $1.3 billion of the $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Under the TCJA, we have incurred a prior year charge associated with the deemed repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings, including foreign held cash. These funds are largely accessible without additional material tax consequences, if needed in the U.S., to fund operations. See Note 15 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 \n\n&#8226; Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $62 million to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1.8 billion for the same period in 2021, primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; favorable changes in trade working capital of $291 million, primarily due to the timing of collections of trade receivables, inventory builds and settlement of trade payables; \n\npartially offset by: \n\n&#8226; a lower earnings performance. \n\n&#8226; Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities \n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $10.0 billion to $11.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1.1 billion for the same period in 2021, primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; a net cash outflow of $9.4 billion related to the M&#38;M Acquisition in November 2022, partially offset by the acquisition of the Santoprene&#8482; thermoplastic vulcanizates elastomers business of Exxon Mobil Corporation in 2021,which did not recur in the current year. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information; and \n\n&#8226; proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $516 million, which did not recur in the current year. \n\n&#8226; Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities \n\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $11.3 billion to $10.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.0 billion for the same period in 2021, primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase in net proceeds of long-term debt of $10.0 billion, primarily due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes consisting of $2.0 billion in principal amount of 5.900% notes due July 5, 2024, $1.75 billion in principal amount of 6.050% notes due March 15, 2025, $2.0 billion in principal amount of 6.165% notes due July 15, 2027, $750 million in principal amount of 6.330% notes due July 15, 2029 and $1.0 billion in principal amount of 6.379% notes due July 15, 2032 (collectively, the \"Acquisition USD Notes\"), as well as senior unsecured notes consisting of &#8364;1.0 billion in principal amount of 4.777% notes due July 19, 2026 and &#8364;500 million in principal amount of 5.337% notes due January 19, 2029 (collectively, the \"Acquisition Euro Notes\" and, together with the Acquisition USD Notes, the \"Acquisition Notes\"), partially offset by the maturity of the 5.875% senior unsecured notes (\"5.875% Notes\") which were repaid during the year ended December 31, 2021; \n\n&#8226; a decrease in share repurchases of our Common Stock of $983 million during the year ended December 31, 2022; and \n\n&#8226; an increase in net borrowings on short-term debt of $336 million, primarily due to borrowing under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility related to the M&#38;M Acquisition in November 2022. \n\nIn addition, exchange rates had a favorable impact of $4 million on cash and cash equivalents and an unfavorable impact of $15 million on cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nDebt and Other Obligations \n\n&#8226; Senior Credit Facilities \n\nIn connection with the M&#38;M Acquisition, on February 17, 2022, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter with Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\") pursuant to which Bank of America committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, a 364-day $11.0 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan facility (the \"Bridge Facility\"). Subsequently, commitments in respect of the Bridge Facility were syndicated to additional financial institutions as contemplated thereby. \n\nOn March 18, 2022, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (the \"March 2022 Term Loan Credit Agreement\"), pursuant to which lenders have provided a tranche of delayed-draw term loans due 364 days from issuance in an amount equal to $500 million and a tranche of delayed-draw term loans due 5 years from issuance in an amount equal to $1.0 billion. On September 16, 2022, Celanese, Celanese U.S. and certain subsidiaries entered into an additional term loan credit agreement (the \"September 2022 Term Loan Credit Agreement\" and, together with the March 2022 Term Loan Credit Agreement, the \"Term Loan Credit Agreements\"), pursuant to which lenders have provided delayed-draw term loans due 3 years from issuance in an amount equal to $750 million (the term loans represented by the Term Loan Credit Agreements collectively, the \"Term Loan Facility\"). The Term Loan Facility was fully drawn during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by Celanese and domestic subsidiaries representing substantially all of our U.S. assets and business operations. \n\nOn March 18, 2022, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement (the \"New Revolving Credit Agreement\" and, together with the Term Loan Credit Agreements the \"Credit Agreements\") consisting of a $1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), maturing in 2027. The proceeds of a $365 million borrowing under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were used to repay and terminate our existing revolving credit facility. \n\n&#8226; Senior Notes \n\nWe have outstanding senior unsecured notes, issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), as amended, as follows (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\"): \n\n##TABLE_START Senior Notes Issue Date Principal Interest Rate Interest Pay Dates Maturity Date (In millions) (In percentages) 1.125% Notes September 2016 &#8364;450 1.125 September 26 September 26, 2023 3.500% Notes May 2019 $500 3.500 May 8 November 8 May 8, 2024 5.900% Notes July 2022 $2,000 5.900 January 5 July 5 July 5, 2024 1.250% Notes December 2017 &#8364;300 1.250 February 11 February 11, 2025 6.050% Notes July 2022 $1,750 6.050 March 15 September 15 March 15, 2025 4.777% Notes July 2022 &#8364;1,000 4.777 July 19 July 19, 2026 1.400% Notes August 2021 $400 1.400 February 5 August 5 August 5, 2026 2.125% Notes November 2018 &#8364;500 2.125 March 1 March 1, 2027 6.165% Notes July 2022 $2,000 6.165 January 15 July 15 July 15, 2027 0.625% Notes September 2021 &#8364;500 0.625 September 10 September 10, 2028 5.337% Notes July 2022 &#8364;500 5.337 January 19 January 19, 2029 6.330% Notes July 2022 $750 6.330 January 15 July 15 July 15, 2029 6.379% Notes July 2022 $1,000 6.379 January 15 July 15 July 15, 2032 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Senior Notes were issued by Celanese U.S. and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Celanese U.S. may redeem some or all of each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus a \"make-whole\" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. \n\nOn July 14, 2022 and July 19, 2022, Celanese U.S. completed the offerings of the Acquisition USD Notes and Acquisition Euro Notes, respectively. Fees and expenses of the offering of the Acquisition Notes, inclusive of underwriting discounts, were $65 million. Net proceeds from the sale of the Acquisition Notes were used to fund the purchase price for the M&#38;M Acquisition, with any remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. \n\nThe entry into the Term Loan Credit Agreements and the offerings of the Acquisition Notes reduced availability under the Bridge Facility to zero, and we terminated the Bridge Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $66 million in fees related to the Bridge Facility commitment, amortizing these fees to interest expense. \n\n&#8226; Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility \n\nIn 2021, we entered into an amendment to the amended and restated receivables purchase agreement under our U.S. accounts receivable purchasing facility among certain of our subsidiaries, our wholly-owned, \"bankruptcy remote\" special purpose subsidiary (\"SPE\") and certain global financial institutions (\"Purchasers\"). We de-recognized $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion of accounts receivable under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and collected $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion of accounts receivable sold under this agreement during the same periods. Unsold U.S. accounts receivable of $99 million were pledged by the SPE as collateral to the Purchasers as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; Factoring and Discounting Agreements \n\nWe have factoring agreements in Europe and Singapore with financial institutions. We de-recognized $320 million and $230 million of accounts receivable under these factoring agreements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and collected $325 million and $185 million of accounts receivable sold under these factoring agreements during the same periods. \n\nIn 2021, we entered into a letter of credit discounting agreement in Singapore with a financial institution. We de-recognized $50 million and $70 million of accounts receivable under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nOur material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of \n\ndefault, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. We are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of December 31, 2022. On February 21, 2023, we amended the Credit Agreements for certain covenants included in the respective credit agreements. \n\nSee Note 11 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nGuarantor Financial Information \n\nWe have outstanding senior unsecured notes, issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\"). The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese U.S. (\"Issuer\") and are guaranteed by Celanese Corporation (\"Parent Guarantor\") and the Subsidiary Guarantors (collectively the \"Obligor Group\"). See Note 11 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors are 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. The Subsidiary Guarantors are listed in Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report. \n\nThe Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors have guaranteed the Senior Notes on a full and unconditional, joint and several, senior unsecured basis. The guarantees are subject to certain customary release provisions, including that a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its respective guarantee in specified circumstances, including (i) the sale or transfer of all of its assets or capital stock; (ii) its merger or consolidation with, or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to, another person; or (iii) its ceasing to be a majority-owned subsidiary of the Issuer in connection with any sale of its capital stock or other transaction. Additionally, a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the Senior Notes at such time that it ceases to guarantee the Issuer's obligations under the Credit Agreement (subject to the satisfaction of customary document delivery requirements). The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under their guarantees are limited as necessary to prevent such guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. \n\nThe Parent Guarantor and the Issuer are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries, which own substantially all of our consolidated assets. The Parent Guarantor has no material assets other than the stock of its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, the Issuer. The principal source of cash to pay the Parent Guarantor's and the Issuer's obligations, including obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of the Issuer's obligations under the Credit Agreement, is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and our non-guarantor subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable country or state laws, regulatory limitations and terms of other debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries' ability to distribute cash to the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor. \n\nFor cash management purposes, we transfer cash among the Parent Guarantor, Issuer, Subsidiary Guarantors and non-guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries do not guarantee the Issuer's obligations under our outstanding debt, the transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Senior Notes, Credit Agreement, other outstanding debt, Common Stock dividends and Common Stock repurchases. \n\nThe summarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented below on a combined basis after the elimination of: (i) intercompany transactions among such entities and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in the non-guarantor subsidiaries. Transactions with, and amounts due to or from, non-guarantor subsidiaries and affiliates are separately disclosed. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 (In $ millions) Net sales to third parties 2,022 Net sales to non-guarantor subsidiaries 1,160 Total net sales 3,182 Gross profit 609 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations 327 Net earnings (loss) 321 Net earnings (loss) attributable to the Obligor Group 321 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 2021 (In $ millions) Receivables from non-guarantor subsidiaries 754 624 Other current assets 1,588 1,236 Total current assets 2,342 1,860 Goodwill 567 578 Other noncurrent assets 2,718 2,584 Total noncurrent assets 3,285 3,162 Current liabilities due to non-guarantor subsidiaries 2,100 2,493 Current liabilities due to affiliates 2 64 Other current liabilities 2,201 1,347 Total current liabilities 4,303 3,904 Noncurrent liabilities due to non-guarantor subsidiaries 3,400 2,348 Other noncurrent liabilities 13,842 3,610 Total noncurrent liabilities 17,242 5,958 ##TABLE_END\n\nShare Capital \n\nOn February 8, 2023, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share on our Common Stock amounting to approximately $76 million. The cash dividend will be paid on March 7, 2023 to holders of record as of February 21, 2023. \n\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the aggregate repurchase of $6.9 billion of our Common Stock since February 2008. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not repurchase any shares of our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.1 billion remaining under authorizations by our Board of Directors. \n\nSee Note 14 - Shareholders' Equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nContractual Obligations, Guarantees and Commitments \n\nWe calculated $2.7 billion of all future interest payments on debt and other obligations using the rate in effect on December 31, 2022 and $476 million of all future pension and other postretirement funding obligations. We have directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to certain equity affiliates. As of December 31, 2022, we have directly guaranteed $142 million and &#8364;27 million of such obligations. \n\nWe have not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements. \n\nIn the accompanying consolidated financial statements, see Note 10 - Current Other Liabilities for current asset retirement obligations, Note 11 - Debt for a description of the guarantees under our Senior Notes and Credit Agreement, Note 12 - Benefit Obligations for a description of the pension and other postretirement funding obligations, Note 13 - Environmental for a description of environmental obligations, Note 15 - Income Taxes for a description of uncertain tax positions, Note 16 - Leases for lease obligations and Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion of commitments and contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings. \n\nMarket Risks \n\nSee Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk for further information. \n\nBusiness Environment \n\nWe experienced significant cost inflation, inflationary pressure and supply disruptions related to the sourcing of raw materials, energy, logistics and labor in 2022. We continue to closely monitor the impact of, and responses to, COVID-19 variants, including government imposed lockdowns and permitted reopenings in various locations around the world, and the effects of geopolitical events on demand conditions and the supply chain. Demand conditions across certain regions in the Western Hemisphere and China deteriorated, creating uncertainty, impacting consumer activity and driving customer destocking. \n\nAverage prices of energy feedstocks, particularly natural gas, which are a significant input and source of energy for our manufacturing operations, increased in the Western Hemisphere and particularly in Europe. We also experienced cost pressure on raw material inputs. We continued pricing actions intended to offset these inflationary headwinds experienced during 2022. Moderation of acetyls pricing trended to more normalized levels by the end of 2022. We expect sourcing costs and inflationary pressures to improve in 2023. \n\nWe continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine. While the conflict has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials as well as other supply chain challenges, particularly in Europe, due in part to the effects of the conflict, and government responses thereto, including sanctions, on the global economy. We continue to monitor these developments. \n\nFollowing Russia's invasion, we have suspended sales into Russia, Belarus and the sanctioned regions of Ukraine. Revenue from these countries and regions constituted less than 1% of our consolidated Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and we have no manufacturing assets in these countries or regions. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. \n\nWe believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results. See Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\n&#8226; Purchase Accounting \n\nWe recognize the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values is recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are valued using the relief from royalty, multi-period excess earnings and discounted cash flow methodologies, which are considered Level 3 measurements. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this method include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Key assumptions used in the multi-period excess earnings method include discount rates, retention rates, growth rates, sales projections, expense projections and contributory asset charges. Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. All of these methodologies require significant management judgment and, therefore, are susceptible to change. We calculate the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to allocate the purchase price at the acquisition date. We may use the assistance of third-party valuation consultants. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\n&#8226; Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets \n\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets \n\nWe assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. \n\nWhen assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of multiple factors, including the current operating environment, financial performance and market considerations. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units or other indefinite-lived intangible assets and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances. \n\nIn performing a quantitative analysis of goodwill, recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. \n\nManagement tests other indefinite-lived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. \n\nSpecific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and company-specific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant. The current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions. To the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections, impairment losses may occur in future periods. \n\nSee Note 9 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\n&#8226; Benefit Obligations \n\nVarious assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These key assumptions include the discount rate and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods. \n\nPension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured. Assumptions are reviewed on a plan and country-specific basis by third-party actuaries and senior management. Such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. \n\nSee Note 12 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nThe estimated change in pension net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligations that would occur in 2023 from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Change in Rate Impact on Net Periodic Benefit Cost Impact on Projected Benefit Obligations (In $ millions) U.S. Pension Benefits Decrease in the discount rate 0.5 % (5) 85 Decrease in the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets (1) \n\n0.5 % 10 N/A Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Decrease in the discount rate 0.5 % (1) 53 Decrease in the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets 0.5 % 3 N/A ##TABLE_END\n\n______________________________ \n\n(1) Excludes nonqualified pension plans. \n\n&#8226; Income Taxes \n\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed. In forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards, we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified. \n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment. If actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or Other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. In addition, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties. \n\nSee Note 15 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n"

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nMarket Risks \n\nOur financial market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including use of derivatives. We have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices as described below. \n\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our derivative and hedging instruments accounting policies related to financial market risk. \n\nSee Note 17 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our market risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Foreign Currency Forwards and Swaps \n\nA portion of our assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the U.S. dollar can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results. Our largest exposures are to the euro and Chinese yuan (\"CNY\"). A decline in the value of the euro and CNY versus the U.S. dollar results in a decline in the U.S. dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros and CNYs. Likewise, an increase in the value of the euro and CNY versus the U.S. dollar would result in an opposite effect. We estimate that a 10% change in the euro/U.S. dollar and CNY/U.S. dollar exchange rates would impact our earnings by $61 million and $41 million, respectively. \n\n"

Controls and Procedures \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. \n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management has elected to exclude the internal control over financial reporting of the recently acquired majority of the Mobility &#38; Materials business (\"M&#38;M\") of DuPont de Nemours, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, see Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. The excluded financial statement amounts of M&#38;M constituted 15% of our consolidated Total assets and 4% of our consolidated Net sales as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Subsequent Events \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors \n\nCelanese Corporation: \n\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celanese Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nThe Company acquired a majority of DuPont's Mobility and Materials (\"M&#38;M\") business during 2022, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, M&#38;M's internal control over financial reporting associated with 15% of total assets and 4% of net sales included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of M&#38;M. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \n\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nEvaluation of the Company's application of multinational income tax regulations \n\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded $489 million of income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022. Because of its multinational presence, the Company's effective income tax rate and related income tax attributes are significantly impacted by tax regulations in certain operating locations. As a result, the Company continuously monitors, evaluates, and responds to these impacts. \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's ongoing assessment and application of multinational income tax regulations as a critical audit matter. This was due to the complex, subjective and evolving nature of tax regulations, the steps taken by the Company to interpret and respond to changes in the tax environment, and taxing authorities' collective impacts on the Company's consolidated income tax computations. As a result, a high degree of auditor judgment and the use of income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were required to 1) evaluate significant income tax regulations, including changes thereto, 2) assess the application of the taxing authorities' regulations on the Company's business operations, and 3) evaluate the Company's accounting for income taxes pertaining to significant transactions and restructurings. \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to 1) the application of tax regulations, 2) the execution of certain significant transactions and restructurings, and 3) their collective impacts on consolidated income tax computations. We involved income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company's interpretation and application of tax regulations, including tax regulation changes, and the associated income tax consequences. They also assisted in assessing certain significant transactions and restructurings, including reviewing the underlying documentation and evaluating the impact on the Company's global tax rate. \n\nFair value of customer-related intangible assets and trade name acquired in a business combination \n\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 1, 2022, the Company acquired a majority of the Mobility and Materials (\"M&#38;M\") business from DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (\"DuPont\") for a purchase price of $11.0 billion, subject to transaction adjustments. The Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identifiable assets and liabilities assumed, of which $1.5 billion was preliminarily allocated to customer-related intangible assets and $1.4 billion was preliminarily allocated to trade names. \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the preliminary fair values of one of the customer-related intangible assets and one of the trade names acquired in the business combination as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment and valuation specialized skills and knowledge were required in evaluating certain inputs into the preliminary fair value determinations, including the royalty rate and discount rate. Changes in these inputs could have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of the intangible assets. \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's purchase accounting process, including controls related to the development of the above-listed inputs into the valuation of the customer- \n\nrelated intangible asset and the trade name. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: (1) evaluating the discount rate by comparing it to an independently developed range of discount rates based on publicly available market data for comparable entities; (2) developing an estimate of fair value of the customer-related intangible asset using projected cash flows of the M&#38;M business and an independently developed range of discount rates, and comparing it to the Company's fair value estimate; (3) evaluating the royalty rate for the trade name by comparing it to royalty rates from comparable licensing agreements; and (4) developing an estimate of fair value of the trade name using the royalty rate and projected cash flows of the M&#38;M business, and an independently developed range of discount rates, and comparing it to the Company's fair value estimate. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2004. \n\nDallas, Texas \n\nFebruary 24, 2023 \n\nCELANESE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In $ millions, except share and per share data) Net sales 9,673 &#160;

Description of the Company and Basis of Presentation \n\nDescription of the Company \n\nCelanese Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\") is a global chemical and specialty materials company. The Company produces high performance engineered polymers that are used in a variety of high-value applications, as well as acetyl products, which are intermediate chemicals for nearly all major industries. The Company also engineers and manufactures a wide variety of products essential to everyday living. The Company's broad product portfolio serves a diverse set of end-use applications including automotive, chemical additives, construction, consumer and industrial adhesives, consumer and medical, energy storage, filtration, food and beverage, paints and coatings, paper and packaging, performance industrial and textiles. \n\nDefinitions \n\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Annual Report\"), the term \"Celanese\" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The term \"Celanese U.S.\" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries. \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") for all periods presented and include the accounts of the Company, its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified, have been presented to separately show the effects of discontinued operations. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements relative to a number of topics, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, supply agreements, product sales and other arrangements. The Company endeavors to describe those contracts or agreements that are material to its business, results of operations or financial position. The Company may also describe some arrangements that are not material but in which the Company believes investors may have an interest or which may have been included in a Form 8-K filing. Investors should not assume the Company has described all contracts and agreements relative to the Company's business in this Annual Report. \n\nFor those consolidated ventures in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100 % of the economics, the outside shareholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interests. \n\n2. Summary of Accounting Policies \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nPurchase Accounting \n\nThe Company recognizes the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values is recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are valued using the relief from royalty, multi-period excess earnings and discounted cash flow methodologies, which are considered Level 3 measurements. The relief from royalty method estimates the Company's theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this method include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Key assumptions used in the multi-period excess earnings method include discount rates, retention rates, growth rates, sales projections, expense projections and contributory asset charges. Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. All of these methodologies require significant management judgment and, therefore, are susceptible to change. The Company calculates the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to allocate the purchase price at the acquisition date. The Company may use the assistance of third-party valuation consultants. \n\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets \n\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its reporting unit goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets either qualitatively or quantitatively annually during the third quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level. The Company assesses the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. Impairment losses are generally recorded in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations. \n\nWhen assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, or an other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of multiple factors, including the current operating environment, financial performance and market considerations. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units or other indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform a quantitative test, based on management's judgment. \n\nIn performing a quantitative analysis of goodwill, the Company measures the recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. The Company may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process. \n\nManagement tests other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The relief from royalty method estimates the Company's theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the WACC considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants. \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Obligations \n\nThe Company recognizes a balance sheet asset or liability for each of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan's funded status as of a December 31 measurement date. The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These assumptions include the discount rate, compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs. In addition, actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation. \n\nThe Company applies the long-term expected rate of return to the fair value of plan assets and immediately recognizes in operating results the change in fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured. Events requiring a plan remeasurement will be recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs. The remaining components of pension and other postretirement plan net periodic benefit costs are recorded on a quarterly basis. \n\nThe Company allocates the service cost and amortization of prior service cost (or credit) components of its pension and postretirement plans to its business segments. Interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses are considered financing activities managed at the corporate level and are recorded to Other Activities. The Company believes the expense allocation appropriately matches the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment. \n\nOther postretirement benefit plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. The key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation are the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate. \n\n&#8226; Discount Rate \n\nAs of the measurement date, the Company determines the appropriate discount rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed-income securities. \n\nIn the U.S., the rate used to discount pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities is based on a yield curve developed from market data of over 300 Aa-grade non-callable bonds at the measurement date. This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pension and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate. \n\nOutside of the U.S., a similar approach of discounting pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities is used based on the high quality corporate bonds available in each market. There are some exceptions to this methodology, namely in locations where there is a sparse corporate bond market, and in such cases the discount rate takes into account yields of government bonds at the appropriate duration. \n\n&#8226; Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets \n\nThe Company determines the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the current target asset allocation, as well as the historical and expected rates of return on various asset categories in which the plans are invested. A single long-term expected rate of return on plan assets is then calculated for each plan as the weighted average of the target asset allocation and the long-term expected rate of return assumptions for each asset category within each plan. The expected rate of return is assessed annually. \n\n&#8226; Investment Policies and Strategies \n\nThe investment objectives for the Company's pension plans are to earn, over a moving 20-year period, a long-term expected rate of return, net of investment fees and transaction costs, sufficient to satisfy the benefit obligations of the plan, while at the same time maintaining adequate liquidity to pay benefit obligations and proper expenses, and meet any other cash needs, in the short- to medium-term. \n\nThe equity and debt securities objectives are to provide diversified exposure across the U.S. and global equity and fixed income markets, and to manage the risks and returns of the plans through the use of multiple managers and strategies. The fixed income strategies are designed to reduce liability-related interest rate risk by investing in bonds that match the duration and credit quality of the plan liabilities. \n\nThe financial objectives of the qualified pension plans are established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of each plan's liability structure. The Company's asset allocation policy is based on detailed asset/liability analysis. In developing investment policy and financial goals, consideration is given to each plan's demographics, the returns and risks associated with current and alternative investment strategies and the current and projected cash, expense and funding ratios of each plan. Investment policies must also comply with local statutory requirements as determined by each country. A formal asset/liability study of each plan is undertaken approximately every three to five years or whenever there has been a material change in plan demographics, benefit structure or funding status and investment market. The Company has adopted a long-term investment horizon such that the risk and duration of investment losses are weighed against the long-term potential for appreciation of assets. Although there cannot be complete assurance that these objectives will be realized, it is believed that the likelihood for their realization is reasonably high, based upon the asset allocation chosen and the historical and expected performance of the asset classes utilized by the plans. The intent is for investments to be broadly diversified across asset classes, investment styles, market sectors, investment managers, developed and emerging markets and securities in order to moderate portfolio volatility and risk. Investments may be in separate accounts, commingled trusts, mutual funds and other pooled asset portfolios provided they all conform to fiduciary standards. \n\nExternal investment managers are hired to manage pension assets. Investment consultants assist with the screening process for each new manager hired. Over the long-term, the investment portfolio is expected to earn returns that exceed a composite of market indices that are weighted to match each plan's target asset allocation. The portfolio return should also (over the long-term) meet or exceed the return used for actuarial calculations in order to meet the future needs of each plan. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date. \n\nThe Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, remaining carryforward periods, applicable tax strategies and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n\nThe Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on technical merits, that the positions will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence and technical authorities in the relevant jurisdiction. \n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Income tax (provision) benefit in the consolidated statements of operations. \n\nOther Accounting Policies \n\nConsolidation Principles \n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for all periods presented and include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \n\nEstimates and Assumptions \n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Significant estimates pertain to impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, purchase price allocations, restructuring costs and other (charges) gains, net, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations, environmental liabilities and loss contingencies, among others. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nVariable Interest Entities \n\nThe Company assesses whether it has a variable interest in legal entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable interest entities (\"VIEs\"). A VIE is an entity with insufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. If an entity is determined to be a VIE, the Company evaluates whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis is a qualitative analysis based on power and economics. The Company concludes that it is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE if the Company has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly influence the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \n\nThe Company has a joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC (\"Fairway\"), with Mitsui &#38; Co., Ltd., of Tokyo, Japan (\"Mitsui\"), in which the Company owns 50 % of Fairway, for the production of methanol at the Company's integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas. Fairway is a VIE in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the venture and records a noncontrolling interest for the share of the venture owned by Mitsui. Fairway is included in the Company's Acetyl Chain segment. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of the total assets associated with \n\nFairway included in the consolidated balance sheets were $ 627 million and $ 628 million, respectively, made up primarily of $ 544 million and $ 560 million, respectively, of property, plant and equipment. \n\nThe Company holds variable interests in entities that supply certain raw materials and services to the Company. The variable interests primarily relate to cost-plus contractual arrangements with the suppliers and recovery of capital expenditures for certain plant assets plus a rate of return on such assets. Liabilities for such supplier recoveries of capital expenditures have been recorded as finance lease obligations. The entities are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the entities as it does not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 223 million and $ 235 million, respectively, related primarily to the recovery of capital expenditures for certain property, plant and equipment. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Market participant assumptions are categorized by a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. Valuations for fund investments, such as common/collective trusts, registered investment companies and short-term investment funds, which do not have readily determinable fair values, are typically estimated using a net asset value provided by a third party as a practical expedient. \n\nThe levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: \n\nLevel 1 - unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the Company \n\nLevel 2 - inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified as Level 1 \n\nLevel 3 - inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nAll highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories, including stores and supplies, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost for inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost for stores and supplies is primarily determined by the average cost method. \n\nInvestments in Affiliates \n\nInvestments in equity securities where the Company can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of an investee, which is generally considered when an investor owns 20% or more of the voting stock of an investee, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments in equity securities where the Company does not exercise significant influence are accounted for at fair value or, if such investments do not have a readily determinable fair value, an election may be made to measure them at cost after considering observable price changes for similar instruments, minus impairment, if any. The Company determined it cannot exercise significant influence over certain investments where the Company owns greater than a 20% interest due to local government investment in and influence over these entities, limitations on the Company's involvement in the day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, these investments were determined not to have a readily determinable fair value. Accordingly, these investments are accounted for using the alternative measure described above. \n\nIn certain instances, the financial information of the Company's equity investees is not available on a timely basis. Accordingly, the Company records its proportional share of the investee's earnings or losses on a consistent lag of no more than one quarter. \n\nWhen required to assess the recoverability of its investments in affiliates, the Company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The Company may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net \n\nLand is recorded at historical cost. Buildings, machinery and equipment, including capitalized interest, and property under finance lease agreements, are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company records depreciation and amortization in its consolidated statements of operations as either Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses consistent with the utilization of the underlying assets. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives of depreciable assets: \n\n##TABLE_START Land improvements 20 years Buildings and improvements 30 years Machinery and equipment 20 years ##TABLE_END\n\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over 10 years or the remaining life of the respective lease, whichever is shorter. \n\nAccelerated depreciation is recorded when the estimated useful life is shortened. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs, including costs for planned maintenance turnarounds, that do not extend the useful life of the asset are charged to earnings as incurred. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and depreciation accounts until sold or otherwise disposed. In the case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in earnings. \n\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be assessed when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. The Company calculates the fair value using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for the asset group, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections involve significant judgment and are based on management's estimate of current and forecasted market conditions and cost structure. Impairment losses are generally recorded in Other (charges) gains, net in the consolidated statements of operations. \n\nDefinite-lived Intangible Assets \n\nCustomer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to 30 years. \n\nDerivative and Hedging Instruments \n\nThe Company manages its exposures to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The fair value of derivative instruments other than foreign currency forwards and swaps is recorded as an asset or liability on a net basis at the balance sheet date. \n\n&#8226; Interest Rate Risk Management \n\nThe Company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap to mitigate the risk of variability in the benchmark interest rate for debt issued in 2021. The interest rate swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, to the extent the cash flow hedges were effective, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were included in gain (loss) from cash flow hedges within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company settled the forward-starting interest rate swap in August 2021, resulting in a payment to the counterparty of $ 72 million, which payment was included as part of financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\n&#8226; Foreign Exchange Risk Management \n\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies, which creates foreign exchange risk. The Company also is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on transactions with third-party entities as well as intercompany transactions. The Company minimizes its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into foreign currency forwards and swaps. These foreign currency forwards and swaps are not designated as hedges. Gains and losses on foreign currency forwards and swaps entered into to offset foreign exchange impacts on intercompany balances are included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on foreign currency forwards and swaps entered into to offset foreign exchange impacts on all other assets and liabilities are included in Foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations. \n\nThe Company uses non-derivative financial instruments that may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains or losses to hedge the foreign currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses from remeasurement of the non-derivative financial instrument is included in foreign currency translation within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged investment is sold or liquidated. \n\nThe Company entered into cross-currency swaps to synthetically convert its USD borrowings to EUR borrowings in 2019 and 2022. The cross-currency swap agreements are designated as a net investment hedge. Accordingly, to the extent the net investment hedges are effective, changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap are included in foreign currency translation within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged investment is sold or liquidated. \n\n&#8226; Commodity Risk Management \n\nThe Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its procurement of certain raw materials. The Company manages its exposure to commodity risk primarily through the use of long-term supply agreements, multi-year purchasing and sales agreements and forward purchase contracts. The Company regularly assesses its practice of using forward purchase contracts and other raw material hedging instruments in accordance with changes in economic conditions. Forward purchases and swap contracts for raw materials are principally settled through physical delivery of the commodity. For qualifying contracts, the Company has elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception based on the probability at the inception and throughout the term of the contract that the Company would not net settle and the transaction would result in the physical delivery of the commodity. Accordingly, realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon the settlement of the contract. \n\nThe Company also uses commodity swaps to hedge the risk of fluctuating price changes in certain raw materials and in which physical settlement does not occur. These commodity swaps fix the variable fee component of the price of certain commodities. All or a portion of these commodity swap agreements may be designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, to the extent the cash flow hedge was effective, changes in the fair value of commodity swaps are included in gain (loss) from cash flow hedges within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are reclassified to earnings in the period that the hedged item affected earnings. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\nPeriodically, the Company will conclude a site no longer has an indeterminate life based on long-lived asset impairment triggering events and decisions made by the Company. Accordingly, the Company will record asset retirement obligations associated with such sites. To measure the fair value of the asset retirement obligations, the Company will use the expected present value technique, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The expected present value technique uses a set of cash flows that represent the probability-weighted average of all possible cash flows based on the Company's judgment. The Company uses the following inputs to determine the fair value of the asset retirement obligations based on the Company's experience with fulfilling obligations of this type and the Company's knowledge of market conditions: (a) labor costs; (b) allocation of overhead costs; (c) profit on labor and overhead costs; (d) effect of inflation on estimated costs and profits; (e) risk premium for bearing the uncertainty inherent in cash flows, other than inflation; (f) time value of money represented by the risk-free interest rate commensurate with the timing of the associated cash flows; and (g) nonperformance risk relating to the liability, which includes the Company's own credit risk. The asset retirement obligations are accreted to their undiscounted values until the time at which they are expected to be settled. \n\nThe Company has identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to certain of its existing operating facilities. Examples of these types of obligations include demolition, decommissioning, disposal and restoration activities. Legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of the existing operations. However, the Company currently plans on continuing operations at these facilities indefinitely and therefore, a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time. In the event the Company considers plans to abandon or cease operations at these sites, an asset retirement obligation will be reassessed at that time. If certain operating facilities were to close, the related asset retirement obligations could significantly affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows. \n\nEnvironmental Liabilities \n\nThe Company manufactures and sells a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world. Accordingly, the Company's operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials. The Company recognizes losses and accrues liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the site, the Company accrues through 15 years , unless the Company has government orders or other agreements that extend beyond 15 years . The Company estimates environmental liabilities on a case-by-case basis using the most current status of available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. \n\nAn environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation monitoring costs. These undiscounted liabilities do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance. The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on the Company's periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort. The Company utilizes third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for its sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur. \n\nLoss Contingencies \n\nWhen determinable, the Company accrues a liability for loss contingencies deemed probable of occurring for which an amount can be reasonably estimated. For certain potentially material loss contingencies, the Company is sometimes unable to estimate and accrue a loss deemed probable of occurring. For such matters, the Company discloses an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss or a statement that such estimate cannot be made. \n\nBecause the Company's evaluation and assessment of critical facts and circumstances surrounding a contingent loss often occurs well in advance of the matter's final determination, there is an inherent subjectivity and unpredictability involved in estimating, accounting for and reporting contingent losses. Generally, the less progress made in the resolution of a contingent loss matter or the broader the range of potential outcomes, the more difficult it is for the Company to estimate, accrue and report a loss. For example, the Company may disclose certain information about a plaintiff's legal claim against the Company that is alleged in the plaintiff's pleadings or otherwise publicly available. While information of this type may provide more insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it may not necessarily be indicative of the Company's estimate of probable or possible loss. In addition, some of the Company's contingent loss exposures may be eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of its insurance coverage. The Company does not consider the potential availability of insurance coverage in determining its probable or possible loss estimates. As a result of these factors among others, the Company's ultimate contingent loss exposure may be higher or lower, and possibly materially so, than the Company's recorded probable loss accruals and disclosures of possible losses. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. The majority of the Company's contracts have a single performance obligation to transfer products. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products and is generally based upon a negotiated, formula, list or fixed price. The Company sells its products both directly to customers and through distributors generally under agreements with payment terms typically less than 90 days. \n\nThe Company has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good. As such, shipping and handling fees billed to customers in a sales transaction are recorded in Net sales and shipping and handling costs \n\nincurred are recorded in Cost of sales. The Company has elected to exclude from Net sales any value add, sales and other taxes which it collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities. \n\n&#8226; Contract Estimates \n\nThe nature of certain of the Company's contracts gives rise to variable consideration, which may be constrained, including retrospective volume-based rebates to certain customers. The Company issues retrospective volume-based rebates to customers when they purchase a certain volume level, and the rebates are applied retroactively to prior purchases. The Company also issues prospective volume-based rebates to customers when they purchase a certain volume level, and the rebates are applied to future purchases. Prospective volume-based rebates represent a material right within the contract and therefore are considered to be separate performance obligations. For both retrospective and prospective volume-based rebates, the Company estimates the level of volumes based on anticipated purchases at the beginning of the period and records a rebate accrual for each purchase toward the requisite rebate volume. These estimated rebates, which are reassessed each reporting period, are included in the transaction price of the Company's contracts with customers as a reduction to Net sales and are included in Current Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets ( Note 10 ). \n\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is derived from contracts (i) with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which it recognizes revenue at the amount in which it has the right to invoice as product is delivered. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to disclose the value of remaining performance obligations associated with these types of contracts. However, the Company has certain contracts that represent take-or-pay revenue arrangements in which the Company's performance obligations extend over multiple years. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 1.4 billion of remaining performance obligations related to take-or-pay contracts. The Company expects to recognize approximately $ 430 million of its remaining performance obligations as Net sales in 2023, $ 430 million in 2024, $ 304 million in 2025 and the balance thereafter. \n\nThe Company has certain contracts which contain performance obligations which are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to assess whether these promised goods or services are performance obligations. \n\n&#8226; Contract Balances \n\nContract liabilities primarily relate to advances or deposits received from the Company's customers before revenue is recognized. These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in Noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nThe Company does not have any material contract assets as of December 31, 2022. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe costs of research and development are charged as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company leases certain real estate, fleet assets, warehouses and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (\"short-term leases\") are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. \n\nOperating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, the Company uses its imputed collateralized rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The estimated rate is based on a risk-free rate plus a risk-adjusted margin. Operating lease ROU assets are comprised of the lease liability plus prepaid rents and are reduced by lease incentives or deferred rents. The Company has lease agreements with non-lease components which are not bifurcated. \n\nMost leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 30 years. The exercise of a lease renewal option typically occurs at the discretion of both parties. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms are deemed not to include options to extend the lease termination until it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Certain of the Company's lease agreements include payments adjusted periodically for inflation based on the consumer price index. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. \n\nFunctional and Reporting Currencies \n\nFor the Company's international operations where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates, while the statement of operations amounts are translated using the average exchange rates for the respective period. Differences arising from the translation of assets and liabilities in comparison with the translation of the previous periods or from initial recognition during the period are included as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net. \n\n3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nThere are no recent Accounting Standard Updates issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board which are expected to materially impact the Company's financial position, operating results or financial disclosures. \n\n4. Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#8226; Santoprene \n\nIn December 2021, the Company acquired the Santoprene&#8482; thermoplastic vulcanizates (\"TPV\") elastomers business of Exxon Mobil Corporation (\"Santoprene\") for a purchase price of $ 1.15 billion in an all-cash transaction. The Company acquired the Santoprene&#8482;, Dytron&#8482; and Geolast&#8482; trademarks and product portfolios, customer and supplier contracts and agreements, both production facilities producing TPV, the TPV intellectual property portfolio with associated technical and R&#38;D assets and employees of the TPV elastomer business. The acquisition of Santoprene substantially strengthens the Company's existing elastomers portfolio, allowing the Company to bring a wider range of functionalized solutions into targeted growth areas including future mobility, medical and sustainability. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the acquired operations are included in the Engineered Materials segment. \n\nThe Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation was based upon preliminary information. During the measurement period, there were no adjustments that materially impacted the Company's goodwill initially recorded. \n\n&#8226; Mobility &#38; Materials \n\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company acquired 100 % ownership of entities and assets consisting of a majority of the Mobility &#38; Materials business (\"M&#38;M\") of DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (\"DuPont\") (the \"M&#38;M Acquisition\") for a purchase price of $ 11.0 billion, subject to transaction adjustments, in an all-cash transaction. The Company acquired a global production network of 29 facilities, including compounding and polymerization, customer and supplier contracts and agreements, an intellectual property portfolio, including approximately 850 patents with associated technical and R&#38;D assets, and approximately 5,000 employees across the manufacturing, technical, and commercial organizations. This acquisition of M&#38;M enhances the engineered materials product portfolio by adding new polymers, brands, product technology, and backward integration in critical polymers, allowing the Company to accelerate growth in high-value applications including future mobility, connectivity and medical. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the acquired operations are included in the Engineered Materials segment. \n\nThe Company preliminarily allocated the purchase price of the acquisition to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. The Company calculated the fair value of the assets acquired using the income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof). Fair values of certain assets were determined based on Level 3 inputs including estimated future cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections, retention rates and terminal values, all of which require significant management judgment and are susceptible to change. The purchase price allocation was based upon preliminary information and is subject to change if additional information about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date becomes available. The Company is in the ongoing process of conducting a valuation of the assets acquired and \n\nliabilities assumed related to the acquisition, including trade names and customer relationships, personal and real property, and deferred taxes. The final fair value of the net assets acquired may result in adjustments to these assets and liabilities, including goodwill.

Restructuring \n\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company completed the restructuring of Korea Engineering Plastics Co. (\"KEPCO\"), a joint venture owned 50 % by the Company and 50 % by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. KEPCO was first formed in 1987 to manufacture and market polyoxymethylene (\"POM\") in Asia, with a particular focus on serving domestic demand in South Korea. KEPCO will now focus solely on manufacturing and supplying high quality products to its shareholders, who will independently market them globally. As part of the restructuring of KEPCO, the Company paid KEPCO $ 5 million and will pay 5 equal annual installments of &#8364; 24 million on October 1 of each year beginning in 2022. This resulted in an increase to the Company's investment in KEPCO of $ 134 million. The Company's joint venture partner will be making similar payments to KEPCO. The restructuring did not result in a change in ownership percentage of KEPCO, nor a change in control, and KEPCO will continue to be accounted for as an equity method investment. \n\nPlant Closures \n\n&#8226; Silao, Mexico \n\nIn September 2022, the Company announced that it will cease manufacturing operations at the Engineered Materials \n\ncompounding facility in Silao, Mexico by the end of 2022, with decommissioning taking place in 2023.

Amounts outstanding under the 5 -year tranche of the Term Loan Facility and 3 -year tranche of the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus a margin of 1.125 % to 2.125 % per annum, or the base rate plus a margin of 0.125 % to 1.125 %, in each case, based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. \n\nThe entry into the Term Loan Credit Agreements and offerings of USD- and euro-denominated notes (as described below) reduced availability under the Bridge Facility to zero and the Company terminated the Bridge Facility. \n\nAlso on March 18, 2022, Celanese, Celanese U.S. and certain subsidiaries entered into a new revolving credit facility (the \"New Revolving Credit Agreement\" and, together with the Term Loan Credit Agreements, the \"Credit Agreements\") consisting of a $ 1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), maturing in 2027. The proceeds of a $ 365 million borrowing under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were used to repay and terminate the Company's existing revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreements are guaranteed by Celanese, Celanese U.S. and domestic subsidiaries together representing substantially all of the Company's U.S. assets and business operations (\"the Subsidiary Guarantors\"). The Subsidiary Guarantors are listed in Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report. \n\nThe Credit Agreements contain certain covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (subject to adjustment following the M&#38;M Acquisition and certain other qualifying acquisitions, as set forth in the Credit Agreements), events of default and change of control provisions. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid $ 66 million in fees related to the Bridge Facility commitment, amortizing these fees to interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nThe Company's debt balances and amounts available for borrowing under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 (In $ millions) Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings outstanding (1) \n\n300 &#160; Available for borrowing (2) \n\n1,450 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n______________________________ \n\n(1) The Company borrowed $ 765 million and repaid $ 465 million under its new senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company borrowed $ 165 million and repaid $ 365 million under its previous unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n(2) The margin for borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility was 1.00 % to 2.00 % above certain interbank rates at current Company credit ratings. \n\nSenior Notes \n\nThe Company has outstanding senior unsecured notes, issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), as amended (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\"). The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese U.S. and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Celanese U.S. may redeem some or all of each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of 100 % of the principal amount, plus a \"make-whole\" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. \n\nOn July 14, 2022, Celanese U.S. completed an offering of $ 7.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes of various maturities in a public offering registered under the Securities Act (the \"Acquisition USD Notes\"). On July 19, 2022, Celanese U.S. completed an offering of &#8364; 1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes due in 2026 and 2029 in a public offering registered under the Securities Act (collectively, the \"Acquisition Euro Notes\" and together with the Acquisition USD Notes, the \"Acquisition Notes\"). Certain of the Acquisition Notes were issued at a discount to par, which is amortized to Interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the terms of the applicable Acquisition Notes. Fees and expenses of the offering of the Acquisition Notes, inclusive of underwriting discounts, were $ 65 million. \n\nIn August 2021, Celanese U.S. completed an offering of $ 400 million in principal amount of 1.400 % senior unsecured notes due August 5, 2026 (the \" 1.400 % Notes\") in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 1.400 % Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.899 %, which is being amortized to Interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the term of the 1.400 % Notes. Net proceeds from the sale of the 1.400 % Notes were used to repay $ 396 million of outstanding borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. \n\nIn September 2021, Celanese U.S. completed an offering of &#8364; 500 million in principal amount of 0.625 % senior unsecured notes due September 10, 2028 (the \" 0.625 % Notes\") in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 0.625 % Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.898 %, which is being amortized to Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the term of the 0.625 % Notes. \n\nIn September 2021, Celanese U.S. completed a cash tender offer for &#8364; 300 million in principal amount of 1.125 % senior unsecured notes due September 26, 2023 (the \" 1.125 % Notes\") at a purchase price of &#8364; 1,027.35 per &#8364;1,000 of principal amount plus accrued interest, for a total principal and premium payment of $ 363 million plus accrued interest of $ 4 million. A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 0.625 % Notes were used to fund the tender offer for &#8364; 300 million of the 1.125 % Notes. As a result of the tender offer, the carrying value of the 1.125 % Notes was reduced by $ 353 million. The Company recognized financing costs of $ 9 million, which are included in Refinancing expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nPrincipal payments scheduled to be made on the Company's debt, including short-term borrowings, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In $ millions) 2023 1,306 &#160; 2024 2,544 &#160; 2025 2,908 &#160; 2026 1,566 &#160; 2027 3,550 &#160; Thereafter 2,879 &#160; Total 14,753 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAccounts Receivable Purchasing Facility \n\nIn June 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the amended and restated receivables purchase agreement (the \"Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement\") under its U.S. accounts receivable purchasing facility among certain of the Company's subsidiaries, its wholly-owned, \"bankruptcy remote\" special purpose subsidiary (\"SPE\") and certain global financial institutions (\"Purchasers\"). The Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement extends the term of the accounts receivable purchasing facility such that the SPE may sell certain receivables until June 18, 2024. Under the Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement, transfers of U.S. accounts receivable from the SPE are treated as sales and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the U.S. accounts receivable to the SPE. The Company and related subsidiaries have no continuing involvement in the transferred U.S. accounts receivable, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the U.S. accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors of the Company or the related subsidiaries. These sales are transacted at 100 % of the face value of the relevant U.S. accounts receivable, resulting in derecognition of the U.S. accounts receivables from the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company de-recognized $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.1 billion of accounts receivable under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and collected $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.1 billion of accounts receivable sold under this agreement during the same periods. Unsold U.S. accounts receivable of $ 99 million were pledged by the SPE as collateral to the Purchasers as of December 31, 2022. \n\nFactoring and Discounting Agreements \n\nThe Company has factoring agreements in Europe and Singapore with financial institutions to sell 100% and 90% of certain accounts receivable, respectively, on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as sales and are accounted for as reductions in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. The Company has no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Company de-recognized $ 320 million and $ 230 million of accounts receivable under these factoring agreements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and collected $ 325 million and $ 185 million of accounts receivable sold under these factoring agreements during the same periods. \n\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into an agreement in Singapore with a financial institution to discount, on a non-recourse basis, documentary credits or other documents recorded as accounts receivable. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. The Company has no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Company de-recognized $ 50 million and $ 70 million of accounts receivable under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nCovenants \n\nThe Company's material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (subject to adjustment following certain qualifying acquisitions, as set forth in the Credit Agreements), events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. The Company is in compliance with all of the covenants related to its debt agreements as of December 31, 2022. On February 21, 2023, the Company amended the Credit Agreements for certain covenants included in the respective credit agreements. \n\n12. Benefit Obligations \n\nPension Obligations \n\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in North America, Europe and Asia. Independent trusts or insurance companies administer the majority of these plans. Pension obligations are established for benefits payable in the form of retirement, disability and surviving dependent pensions. The commitments result from participation in defined contribution and defined benefit plans, primarily in the U.S. Benefits are dependent on years of service and the employee's compensation. Supplemental retirement benefits provided to certain employees are nonqualified for U.S. tax purposes. Separate nonqualified trusts have been established for certain U.S. nonqualified plan obligations. Pension costs under the Company's retirement plans are actuarially determined. \n\nOther Postretirement Obligations \n\nCertain retired employees receive postretirement health care and life insurance benefits under plans sponsored by the Company, which has the right to modify or terminate these plans at any time. The cost for coverage is shared between the Company and the retiree. The cost of providing retiree health care and life insurance benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee group. The Company's policy is to fund benefits as claims and premiums are paid. The U.S. postretirement health care plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2006. \n\nDefined Contribution Plans \n\nThe Company sponsors various defined contribution plans in North America, Europe and Asia covering certain employees. Employees may contribute to these plans and the Company will match these contributions in varying amounts. The Company's matching contribution to the defined contribution plans are based on specified percentages of employee contributions. \n\nThe amount of costs recognized for the Company's defined contribution plans are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In $ millions) Defined contribution plans 62 &#160;

The U.S. qualified defined benefit plans' actual return on assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 was ( 19.5 )% versus an expected long-term rate of asset return assumption of 5.5 %. The expected long-term rate of asset return assumption used to determine 2023 net periodic benefit cost is 5.5 % for the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans. \n\nThe Company's defined benefit plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis ( Note 2 ) as follows: \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: Foreign and domestic currencies as well as short-term securities are valued at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. \n\nEquity securities, treasuries and corporate debt: Valued at the closing price reported on the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Automated quotes are provided by multiple pricing services and validated by the plan custodian. These securities are traded on exchanges as well as in the over the counter market. \n\nRegistered Investment Companies: Composed of various mutual funds and other investment companies whose diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic equities, fixed income securities, and short-term investments. Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year-end. \n\nPooled-type investments: Composed of various funds whose diversified portfolio is comprised of foreign and domestic equities, fixed income securities, and short-term investments. Investments are valued at the net asset value of units held by the plan at year-end. \n\nDerivatives: Derivative financial instruments are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurement inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk.

Environmental \n\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations worldwide that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and impose record keeping and notification requirements. Failure to timely comply with these laws and regulations may expose the Company to penalties. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and engages in an ongoing process of updating its controls to mitigate compliance risks. The Company is also subject to retained environmental obligations specified in various contractual agreements arising from the divestiture of certain businesses by the Company or one of its predecessor companies. \n\nThe components of environmental remediation liabilities are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 2021 (In $ millions) \n\nDemerger obligations ( Note 19 ) \n\n20 &#160; 24 &#160; \n\nDivestiture obligations ( Note 19 ) \n\n14 &#160; 14 &#160; Active sites 21 &#160; 8 &#160; U.S. Superfund sites 10 &#160; 12 &#160; Other environmental remediation liabilities 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Total 67 &#160; 60 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRemediation \n\nDue to its industrial history and through retained contractual and legal obligations, the Company has the obligation to remediate specific areas on its own sites as well as on divested, demerger, orphan or U.S. Superfund sites (as defined below). In addition, as part of the demerger agreement between the Company and Hoechst AG (\"Hoechst\"), a specified portion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of Hoechst divestitures was transferred to the Company ( Note 19 ). Certain of these sites, at which the Company maintains continuing involvement, were and continue to be designated as discontinued operations when closed. The Company provides for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company believes that environmental remediation costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given period. \n\nThe Company did not record any insurance recoveries during 2022 or have any receivables for insurance recoveries related to these matters as of December 31, 2022. \n\nGerman InfraServ Entities \n\nThe Company's InfraServ Entities ( Note 7 ) are liable for any residual contamination and other pollution because they own the real estate on which the individual facilities operate. In addition, Hoechst, and its legal successors, as the responsible party under German public law, is liable to third parties for all environmental damage that occurred while it was still the owner of the plants and real estate ( Note 19 ). The contribution agreements entered into in 1997 between Hoechst and the respective operating companies, as part of the divestiture of these companies, provide that the operating companies will indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against environmental liabilities resulting from the transferred businesses. Additionally, the InfraServ Entities have agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, against any environmental liability arising out of or in connection with environmental pollution of any site. \n\nThe InfraServ partnership agreements provide that, as between the partners, each partner is responsible for any contamination caused predominantly by such partner. Any liability, which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner and for which no third party is responsible, is required to be borne by the InfraServ partnership. Also, under lease agreements entered into by an InfraServ partner as landlord, the tenants agreed to pay certain remediation costs on a pro rata basis. \n\nIf an InfraServ partner defaults on its respective indemnification obligations to eliminate residual contamination, the owners of the remaining participation in the InfraServ companies have agreed to fund such liabilities, subject to a number of limitations. To the extent that any liabilities are not satisfied by either the InfraServ Entities or their owners, these liabilities are to be borne by the Company in accordance with the demerger agreement. However, Hoechst, and its legal successors, will reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any such costs. Likewise, in certain circumstances the Company could be responsible for the elimination of residual contamination on several sites that were not transferred to InfraServ companies, in which case Hoechst, and its legal successors, must also reimburse the Company for two-thirds of any costs so incurred. \n\nThe Company's ownership interest and environmental liability participation percentages for such liabilities, which cannot be attributed to an InfraServ partner are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 Ownership Liability Reserves (1) \n\n(In percentages) (In $ millions) InfraServ GmbH &#38; Co. Gendorf KG 30 &#160; 10 &#160; 9 &#160; InfraServ GmbH &#38; Co. Hoechst KG 31 &#160; 40 &#160; 64 &#160; Yncoris GmbH &#38; Co. KG 22 &#160; 22 &#160; 1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n______________________________ \n\n(1) Gross reserves maintained by the respective entity. \n\nU.S. Superfund Sites \n\nIn the U.S., the Company may be subject to substantial claims brought by U.S. federal or state regulatory agencies or private individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In particular, the Company has a potential liability under the U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws (collectively referred to as \"Superfund\") for investigation and cleanup costs at certain sites. At most of these sites, numerous companies, including the Company, or one of its predecessor companies, have been notified that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), state governing bodies or private individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible parties (\"PRP\") under Superfund or related laws. The proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages. The cleanup process has not been completed at most sites, and the status of the insurance coverage for some of these proceedings is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot accurately determine its ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs at these sites. \n\nAs events progress at each site for which it has been named a PRP, the Company accrues any probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In establishing these liabilities, the Company considers the contaminants of concern, the potential impact thereof, the relationship of the contaminants of concern to its current and historic operations, its shipment of waste to a site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company joins with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that settle, among PRPs, each party's percentage allocation of costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most current information available. \n\nOne such site is the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, which is comprised of a number of sub-sites, including the Lower Passaic River Study Area (\"LPRSA\"), which is the lower 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River (\"Lower Passaic River Site\"), and the Newark Bay Area. The Company and 70 other companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (\"RI/FS\") at the Lower Passaic River Site in order to identify the levels of contaminants and potential cleanup actions, including the potential migration of contaminants between the Lower Passaic River Site and the Newark Bay Area. \n\nIn March 2016, the EPA issued its final Record of Decision concerning the remediation of the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River Site (\"Lower 8.3 Miles\"). Pursuant to the EPA's Record of Decision, the Lower 8.3 Miles must be dredged bank to bank and an engineered cap must be installed at an EPA estimated cost of approximately $ 1.4 billion. In September 2021, the EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting an interim remedial plan for the upper 9 miles of the Lower Passaic River (\"Upper 9 Miles\"). Pursuant to the EPA's Record of Decision, targeted dredging will be conducted in the Upper 9 Miles to address surface sediments with elevated contamination followed by the installation of an engineered cap at an EPA estimated cost of $ 441 million. \n\nThe Company owned and/or operated facilities in the vicinity of the Lower 8.3 Miles, but has found no evidence that it contributed any of the contaminants of concern to the Passaic River. In June 2018, Occidental Chemical Corporation (\"OCC\"), the successor to the Diamond Alkali Company, sued a subsidiary of the Company and 119 other parties alleging claims for joint and several damages, contribution and declaratory relief under Section 107 and 113 of Superfund for costs to clean up the LPRSA portion of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, Occidental Chemical Corporation v. 21st Century Fox America, Inc., et al, No. 2:18-CV-11273-JLL-JAD (U.S. District Court New Jersey), alleging that each of the defendants owned or operated a facility that contributed contamination to the LPRSA. With respect to the Company, the OCC lawsuit is limited to the former Celanese facility that Essex County, New Jersey has agreed to indemnify the Company for and does not change the Company's estimated liability for LPRSA cleanup costs. \n\nSeparately, the United States lodged a Consent Decree in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey on December 16, 2022 that will resolve the Company's liability (and that of more than 80 other settling defendants) to the EPA for costs to clean up both the Lower 8.3 Miles and Upper 9 Miles of the Lower Passaic River Site in exchange for a collective payment of $ 150 million. The Consent Decree also will provide the Company protection from contribution claims by others for costs incurred to clean up both the Lower 8.3 Miles and Upper 9 Miles of the Lower Passaic River Site. The Company's proposed payment toward the $ 150 million collective settlement payment is not material to the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Consent Decree is still subject to public comment and court approval. In the interim, the Company continues to vigorously defend these matters and continues to believe that its ultimate allocable share of the cleanup costs with respect to the Lower Passaic River Site, previously estimated at less than 1 %, will not be material. \n\nOther Environmental Matters \n\nIn April 2022, a methanol leak on a pipeline to our Bishop, Texas facility was discovered. The release has been contained, the leak has been repaired and the pipeline has resumed operation. The Company promptly disclosed the incident to state and federal authorities, including the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the EPA, and remediation activities are now completed. While the Company has not received a notice of violation nor been assessed any fines or penalties to date, the Company recorded a reserve in Current Other liabilities based on anticipated clean-up costs and possible penalties to state or federal authorities. The Company does not believe that resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \n\n14. Shareholders' Equity \n\nCommon Stock \n\nThe Company's Board of Directors follows a policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend on each share of the Company's common stock, par value $ 0.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"), unless the Company's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. The amount available to the Company to pay cash dividends is not currently restricted by its existing senior credit facility and its indentures governing its senior unsecured notes. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Company's Board of Directors may deem relevant. \n\nOn February 8, 2023, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.70 per share on its Common Stock amounting to approximately $ 76 million. The cash dividend will be paid on March 7, 2023 to holders of record as of February 21, 2023. \n\nTreasury Stock \n\nThe Company's Board of Directors authorizes repurchases of Common Stock from time to time. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. \n\nThe share repurchase activity pursuant to this authorization is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Total From February 2008 Through December 31, 2022 &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Shares repurchased &#8212; &#160; \n\n6,556,378 &#160; 5,889,073 &#160; 69,324,429 &#160; Average purchase price per share $ &#8212; &#160; $ 152.53 &#160; $ 110.41 &#160; $ 83.71 &#160; Amount spent on repurchased shares (in millions) $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,000 &#160; $ 650 &#160; $ 5,803 &#160; Aggregate Board of Directors repurchase authorizations during the period (in millions) $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,000 &#160; $ 500 &#160; $ 6,866 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe purchase of treasury stock reduces the number of shares outstanding.

Income Taxes \n\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") was enacted and was effective January 1, 2018. The U.S. Treasury has issued various final and proposed regulatory packages supplementing the TCJA provisions since 2018. In December 2021, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations clarifying certain items in the TCJA and prior guidance related to disallowance of foreign income taxes related to income exempt from U.S. taxation, treatment of debt between foreign affiliates for expense apportionment purpose, allocation and apportionment of foreign income taxes and the definition of creditable foreign income taxes. The regulations were published in the federal register on January 4, 2022 and became effective in the three months ended March 31, 2022. In November 2022, the U.S. Treasury released proposed foreign tax credit regulations addressing the eligibility of foreign taxes for credit by clarifying the cost recovery requirements, attribution requirements for withholding taxes on royalties and attribution definitions regarding allocation and apportionment of foreign taxes. The Company does not expect the final or the proposed regulations to have a material impact to current or future income tax expense. \n\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the \"IRA\") was enacted and included a 1% excise tax on share repurchases in excess of $1 million, and a corporate minimum tax of 15% on adjusted book earnings. The corporate minimum tax paid is creditable in future years to the extent that regular tax liability exceeds the minimum tax in any given year. The Company does not expect these provisions will have a material impact to future income tax expense. The IRA also provides various beneficial credits for energy efficient related manufacturing, transportation and fuels, hydrogen/carbon recapture and renewable energy, which the Company is evaluating in regard to planned projects. \n\nThe Company will continue to monitor the expected impacts of any new guidance on the Company's filing positions and will record the impacts as discrete income tax expense adjustments in the period the guidance is finalized or becomes effective. \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations before tax by jurisdiction are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In $ millions) U.S. ( 292 ) 202 &#160; 1,530 &#160; International 1,713 &#160; 2,046 &#160; 721 &#160; Total 1,421 &#160; 2,248 &#160; 2,251 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In $ millions) Current U.S. 54 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; International 306 &#160; 323 &#160; 126 &#160; Total 360 &#160; 323 &#160; 139 &#160; Deferred U.S. ( 261 ) ( 16 ) 308 &#160; International ( 588 ) 23 &#160; ( 200 ) Total ( 849 ) 7 &#160; 108 &#160; Total ( 489 ) 330 &#160; 247 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nA reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In $ millions, except percentages) Income tax provision computed at U.S. federal statutory tax rate 298 &#160; 472 &#160; 473 &#160; Change in valuation allowance ( 15 ) ( 50 ) ( 1 ) Equity income and dividends ( 47 ) ( 29 ) ( 54 ) (Income) expense not resulting in tax impact, net 2 &#160; ( 53 ) ( 46 ) U.S. tax effect of foreign earnings and dividends 162 &#160; 332 &#160; 65 &#160; Foreign tax credits ( 120 ) ( 328 ) ( 51 ) Other foreign tax rate differentials \n\n( 43 ) ( 66 ) 7 &#160; Legislative changes &#8212; &#160; ( 8 ) 1 &#160; State income taxes, net of federal benefit ( 2 ) 6 &#160; 4 &#160; Recognition of basis differences in investments in affiliates 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 14 ) Asset transfers between wholly owned foreign affiliates ( 816 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 170 ) Other, net 86 &#160; 54 &#160; 33 &#160; Income tax provision (benefit) ( 489 ) 330 &#160; 247 &#160; Effective income tax rate \n\n( 34 ) &#160;% 15 &#160; &#160;% 11 &#160; &#160;% ##TABLE_END\n\nIn December 2022, as part of its integration efforts for the M&#38;M Acquisition (see Note 4 ) and to simplify future cash flows for purposes of acquisition debt repayment, the Company reorganized its foreign legal entity holding structure and relocated certain of its intangible assets to align with the acquired M&#38;M foreign operations. The transfer of these assets between wholly owned foreign affiliates, generated a net deferred tax benefit of approximately $ 800 million. \n\nIncluded in the Other, net line in the effective income tax rate reconciliation above are charges of approximately $ 20 million related to transaction costs for the M&#38;M Acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $ 63 million, $ 65 million and $ 40 million related to changes in uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and impacts of amended tax return filings. \n\nIn October 2020, the Company completed the sale of its 45 % joint venture equity interest in Polyplastics (see Note 7 ). The tax gain on this disposal was less than the related gain for financial reporting purposes due to basis differences. In November 2020, the Company relocated certain tangible and intangible assets in response to various geopolitical risks in certain regions in which it operates. The transfer of these assets between wholly owned foreign affiliates in this reorganization generated a deferred tax benefit of approximately $ 170 million. \n\nDeferred Income Taxes \n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

These valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforward benefits, foreign tax credit carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets, all of which may not be realizable. \n\nAs a result of the TCJA, U.S. federal and state income taxes have been recorded on undistributed foreign earnings accumulated from 1986 through 2017. The Company's previously taxed income for its foreign subsidiaries significantly exceeds its offshore cash balances. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding or other foreign local tax that would be due when cash is actually repatriated to the U.S. because those foreign earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the business or may be remitted substantially free of any additional local taxes. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable. \n\nTax Carryforwards \n\n&#8226; Net Operating Loss and Capital Loss Carryforwards \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had available U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 22 million that are subject to limitation. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2022, the Company also had available state net operating loss carryforwards, net of federal tax impact, of $ 32 million, $ 24 million of which are offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertain recoverability. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards available as of December 31, 2022 of $ 3.0 billion primarily for Malta, Luxembourg, Spain, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Switzerland, Hong Kong and China with various expiration dates. Net operating loss carryforwards of $ 34 million in China are scheduled to expire beginning in 2023 through 2027. Net operating losses in most other foreign jurisdictions do not have an expiration date. The Company acquired capital loss carryforwards of $ 173 million as part of the M&#38;M Acquisition ( Note 4 ) that are subject to annual limitation due to the ownership change. The Company fully offset these capital loss carryforwards with a valuation allowance due to uncertain recoverability. \n\n&#8226; Tax Credit Carryforwards \n\nThe Company had available $ 337 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards, which are offset by a valuation allowance of $ 298 million due to uncertain recoverability and $ 18 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are subject to a ten-year carryforward period and begin to expire in 2027. The alternative minimum tax credits are subject to annual limitation due to prior ownership changes but have an unlimited carryforward period and can be used to offset federal tax liability in future years. \n\nThe Company evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the applicable carryback or carryforward periods. Changes in the Company's estimates of future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies will affect the estimate of the realization of the tax benefits of these foreign tax credit carryforwards. As such, the Company is currently evaluating tax planning strategies to enable use of the foreign tax credit carryforwards that may decrease the Company's effective tax rate in future periods as the valuation allowance is reversed. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nActivity related to uncertain tax positions is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In $ millions) As of the beginning of the year 218 &#160; 165 &#160; 134 &#160; Increases in tax positions for the current year 8 &#160; 33 &#160; 18 &#160; Increases in tax positions for prior years 102 &#160; 28 &#160; 26 &#160; Decreases in tax positions for prior years ( 45 ) ( 11 ) ( 13 ) Increases (decreases) due to settlements ( 8 ) 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; As of the end of the year 275 &#160; 218 &#160; 165 &#160; Total uncertain tax positions that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate 274 &#160; 224 &#160; 182 &#160; Total amount of interest expense (benefit) and penalties recognized in the consolidated statements of operations (1) \n\n10 &#160; 2 &#160; 6 &#160; Total amount of interest expense and penalties recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 59 &#160; 52 &#160; 54 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n______________________________ \n\n(1) This amount reflects interest on uncertain tax positions and release of tax positions due to changes in assessment, statute lapses or audit closures that were reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. \n\nThe increase in uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to increases in foreign tax positions related to ongoing tax examinations. \n\nThe Company's tax returns have been under joint audit for the years 2013 through 2015 by the United States, Netherlands and Germany (the \"Authorities\"). In September 2021, the Company received a draft joint audit report proposing adjustments to transfer pricing and the reallocation of income between the related jurisdictions. The Authorities also proposed to apply these adjustments to open tax years through 2019. The Company and the Authorities were unable to reach an agreement jointly and therefore the audits continued on a separate jurisdictional basis. In the last quarter of 2022, the Company concluded settlement discussions with the Dutch tax authorities. Based on these discussions, the Company recorded total tax reserves of $ 34 million related to the joint audit for years prior to 2022. The Company is engaged in continuing discussions with the other Authorities and is currently evaluating all additional potential remedies regarding the ongoing examinations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company believes that an adequate provision for income taxes has been made for all open tax years related to the examinations by the Authorities. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues raised by the Authorities are resolved in a manner inconsistent with the Company's expectations or the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. If required, any such adjustments could be material to the statements of operations and cash flows in the period(s) recorded. \n\nIn addition, the Company's income tax returns in Mexico are under audit for the years 2017 and 2018, and in Canada for the years 2016 through 2018. On January 14, 2022, the Mexico tax authorities issued preliminary findings for disallowance of operating expenses on several of the applicable tax returns. The Company has analyzed the preliminary findings, engaged in preliminary discussions with the Mexico tax authorities and has recorded the appropriate tax reserves as of December 31, 2022. The Company will continue discussions with the Mexico authorities in 2023. Related to Canada, the Company is discussing preliminary findings with the Canadian authorities and does not expect a material impact to income tax expense. \n\n16.

Fair Value Measurements \n\nThe Company's financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis ( Note 2 ) as follows: \n\nDerivatives. Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, commodity swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps and are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurement inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are utilized in the discounted cash flow calculation considering the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk. Significant inputs to the derivative valuation for interest rate swaps, commodity swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are observable in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fair Value Measurement Balance Sheet Classification Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Total As of December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 &#160; (In $ millions) Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges \n\nCommodity swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; 8 &#160; 9 &#160; 8 &#160; Current Other assets Commodity swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 39 &#160; 23 &#160; 39 &#160; 23 &#160; Noncurrent Other assets Derivatives Designated as Net Investment Hedges \n\nCross-currency swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 99 &#160; 2 &#160; 99 &#160; 2 &#160; Current Other assets Cross-currency swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; 5 &#160; 13 &#160; 5 &#160; Noncurrent Other assets Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges Foreign currency forwards and swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; 2 &#160; 9 &#160; 2 &#160; Current Other assets Total assets &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 169 &#160; 40 &#160; 169 &#160; 40 &#160; Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Commodity swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) &#8212; &#160; Current Other liabilities \n\nDerivatives Designated as Net Investment Hedges \n\nCross-currency swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 58 ) ( 2 ) ( 58 ) ( 2 ) Current Other liabilities Cross-currency swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 126 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 126 ) &#8212; &#160; Noncurrent Other liabilities \n\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedges Foreign currency forwards and swaps &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Current Other liabilities Total liabilities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 189 ) ( 5 ) ( 189 ) ( 5 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nCarrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Measurement Carrying Amount Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total As of December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 (In $ millions) Equity investments without readily determinable fair values \n\n170 &#160; 170 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Insurance contracts in nonqualified trusts 22 &#160; 28 &#160; 23 &#160; 28 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 23 &#160; 28 &#160; Long-term debt, including current installments of long-term debt \n\n13,953 &#160; 3,722 &#160; 13,247 &#160; 3,639 &#160; 172 &#160; 173 &#160; 13,419 &#160; 3,812 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn general, the equity investments included in the table above are not publicly traded and their fair values are not readily determinable. The Company believes the carrying values approximate fair value. Insurance contracts in nonqualified trusts consist of long-term fixed income securities, which are valued using independent vendor pricing models with observable inputs in the active market and therefore represent a Level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of long-term debt is based on valuations from third-party banks and market quotations and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The fair value of obligations under finance leases, which are included in long-term debt, is based on lease payments and discount rates, which are not observable in the market and therefore represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, marketable securities, trade payables, short-term borrowings and the current installments of long-term debt approximate carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These items have been excluded from the table with the exception of the current installments of long-term debt. \n\n19. Commitments and Contingencies \n\nCommitments \n\nGuarantees \n\nEquity Affiliates \n\nThe Company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to certain equity affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the Company had directly guaranteed $ 142 million and &#8364; 27 million of such obligations. These amounts represent the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the Company could be required to make under the guarantees. The Company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. \n\nMaximum future payments under these obligations are $ 142 million and &#8364; 27 million for bank borrowings and the guarantee will remain in force until all guaranteed obligations are paid and the underlying debt agreements entered into by certain equity affiliates are terminated. \n\nEnvironmental and Other Liabilities \n\nThe Company has agreed to guarantee or indemnify third parties for environmental and other liabilities pursuant to a variety of agreements, including asset and business divestiture agreements, leases, settlement agreements and various agreements with affiliated companies. Although many of these obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, others do not provide such limitations. \n\nThe Company has accrued for all probable and reasonably estimable losses associated with all known matters or claims. These known obligations include the following: \n\n&#8226; Demerger Obligations \n\nIn connection with the Hoechst demerger, the Company agreed to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, for various liabilities under the demerger agreement, including for environmental liabilities associated with contamination arising either from environmental damage in general (\"Category A\") or under 19 divestiture agreements entered into by Hoechst prior to the demerger (\"Category B\") ( Note 13 ). \n\nThe Company's obligation to indemnify Hoechst, and its legal successors, is capped under Category B at &#8364; 250 million. If and to the extent the environmental damage should exceed &#8364; 750 million in aggregate, the Company's obligation to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors applies, but is then limited to 33.33 % of the remediation cost without further limitations. Cumulative payments under the divestiture agreements as of December 31, 2022 are $ 107 million. Though the Company is significantly under its obligation cap under Category B, most of the divestiture agreements have become time barred and/or any notified environmental damage claims have been partially settled. \n\nThe Company has also undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors for (i) 33.33 % of any and all Category A liabilities that result from Hoechst being held as the responsible party pursuant to public law or current or future environmental law or by third parties pursuant to private or public law related to contamination and (ii) liabilities that Hoechst is required to discharge, including tax liabilities, which are associated with businesses that were included in the demerger but were not demerged due to legal restrictions on the transfers of such items. These indemnities do not provide for any monetary or time limitations. The Company has not been requested by Hoechst to make any payments in connection with this indemnification. Accordingly, the Company has not made any payments to Hoechst and its legal successors. \n\nBased on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the lack of requests for indemnification, the Company cannot estimate the remaining demerger obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. \n\n&#8226; Divestiture Obligations \n\nThe Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees represent standard contractual terms associated with typical divestiture agreements and, other than environmental liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the Company to significant risk ( Note 13 ). \n\nThe Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and facilities through agreements containing indemnifications or guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, which extend through 2037. The aggregate amount of outstanding indemnifications and guarantees provided for under these agreements is $ 125 million as of December 31, 2022. Other agreements do not provide for any monetary or time limitations. \n\nBased on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the number of requests for indemnification or other payment received by the Company, the Company cannot estimate the remaining divestiture obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. \n\nPurchase Obligations \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into various purchase commitments for goods and services. The Company maintains a number of \"take-or-pay\" contracts for purchases of raw materials, utilities and other services. Certain of the contracts contain a contract termination buy-out provision that allows for the Company to exit the contracts for amounts less than the remaining take-or-pay obligations. Additionally, the Company has other outstanding commitments representing maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts and software agreements. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of $ 4.3 billion, of which $ 721 million will be paid in 2023, $ 656 million in 2024, $ 538 million in 2025, $ 411 million in 2026, $ 333 million in 2027 and the balance thereafter through 2042. \n\nContingencies \n\nThe Company is involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of business, relating to such matters as product liability, land disputes, insurance coverage disputes, contracts, employment, antitrust or competition compliance, intellectual property, personal injury and other actions in tort, workers' compensation, chemical exposure, asbestos exposure, taxes, trade compliance, acquisitions and divestitures, claims of current and legacy shareholders, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment. The Company is actively defending those matters where the Company is named as a defendant and, based on the current facts, does not believe the outcomes from these matters would be material to the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. \n\nEuropean Commission Investigation \n\nIn May 2017, the Company learned that the European Commission had opened a competition law investigation involving certain subsidiaries of the Company with respect to certain past ethylene purchases. Based on information learned from the European Commission regarding its investigation, Celanese recorded a reserve of $ 89 million in 2019, which was included within the Company's Other Activities segment. In July 2020, Celanese reached a final settlement with the European Commission in respect of this matter of $ 92 million, which was included in Current Other liabilities as of December 31, 2020. The Company paid this settlement in full in January 2021. \n\n20.

Segment Information \n\nBusiness Segments \n\nThe Company operates through business segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of its products and customer relationships, as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the Company's key decision maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer. \n\nEffective December 31, 2022, the Company reorganized its operating and reportable segments to align with recent structural and management reporting changes. The change reflects the resegmentation of the former Acetate Tow operating and reportable segment into the Acetyl Chain operating and reportable segment. This reorganization reflects the culmination of a shift in operating strategy and organizational hierarchy, with a focus on integration, collaboration and maximization of value creation through its global optionality and integrated chain model of the underlying businesses. The historical segment information has been recast to conform with the reorganized segments. \n\nThe Company's business segments are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Engineered Materials \n\nThe Company's Engineered Materials segment includes the engineered materials business, food ingredients business and certain strategic affiliates. The engineered materials business develops, produces and supplies a broad portfolio of high performance specialty polymers for automotive and medical applications, as well as industrial products and consumer electronics. Together with its strategic affiliates, the Company's engineered materials business is a leading participant in the global specialty polymers industry.

The Company's RDP business is a leading producer of products that have applications in a number of building and construction applications including flooring, plasters, insulation, tiling and waterproofing. The Company's acetate tow business serves consumer-driven applications and is a leading global producer and supplier of acetate tow and acetate flake, primarily used in filter products applications. \n\n&#8226; Other Activities \n\nOther Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs, including administrative activities such as finance, information technology and human resource functions, interest income and expense associated with financing activities and results of the Company's captive insurance companies. Other Activities also includes the components of net periodic benefit cost (interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses) for the Company's defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans not allocated to the Company's business segments. \n\nThe business segment management reporting and controlling systems are based on the same accounting policies as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies ( Note 2 ). \n\nSales transactions between business segments are generally recorded at values that approximate third-party selling prices. \n\n##TABLE_START Engineered Materials Acetyl Chain Other Activities Eliminations Consolidated (In $ millions) Year Ended December 31, 2022 Net sales 4,024 &#160; 5,743 &#160; (1) &#8212; &#160; ( 94 ) 9,673 &#160; \n\nOther (charges) gains, net ( Note 24 ) \n\n( 7 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 8 ) Operating profit (loss) \n\n429 &#160; 1,447 &#160; ( 498 ) &#8212; &#160; 1,378 &#160; Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates \n\n202 &#160; 7 &#160; 11 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 220 &#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n226 &#160; 213 &#160; 23 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 462 &#160; Capital expenditures 178 &#160; 352 &#160; 53 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 583 &#160; (2) As of December 31, 2022 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 10,826 &#160; 421 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,247 &#160; Total assets 20,611 &#160; 5,471 &#160; 190 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 26,272 &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2021 Net sales 2,718 &#160; 5,894 &#160; (1) &#8212; &#160; ( 75 ) 8,537 &#160; \n\nOther (charges) gains, net ( Note 24 ) \n\n6 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 4 ) &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; Operating profit (loss) \n\n411 &#160; 1,875 &#160; ( 340 ) &#8212; &#160; 1,946 &#160; Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates \n\n126 &#160; 7 &#160; 13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 146 &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n144 &#160; 210 &#160; 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 371 &#160; Capital expenditures 154 &#160; 311 &#160; 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 490 &#160; (2) As of December 31, 2021 Goodwill and intangible assets, net \n\n1,714 &#160; 433 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,147 &#160; Total assets 5,363 &#160; 5,526 1,086 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,975 &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2020 Net sales 2,081 &#160; 3,634 &#160; (1) &#8212; &#160; ( 60 ) 5,655 &#160; \n\nOther (charges) gains, net ( Note 24 ) \n\n( 36 ) 6 &#160; ( 9 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 39 ) Operating profit (loss) \n\n235 &#160; 681 &#160; ( 252 ) &#8212; &#160; 664 &#160; Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates \n\n115 &#160; 5 &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 134 &#160; \n\nGain (loss) on sale of investments in affiliates ( Note 7 ) \n\n1,408 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,408 &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n134 &#160; 199 &#160; 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 350 &#160; Capital expenditures 106 &#160; 208 &#160; 34 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 348 &#160; (2) ##TABLE_END\n\n______________________________ \n\n(1) Includes intersegment sales of $ 94 million, $ 75 million and $ 60 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n(2) Includes an increase in accrued capital expenditures of $ 40 million, an increase in accrued capital expenditures of $ 23 million and a decrease in accrued capital expenditures of $ 16 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nGeographical Area Information \n\nThe Net sales to external customers based on geographic location are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In $ millions) Belgium 251 &#160; 268 &#160; 274 &#160; Canada 120 &#160; 98 &#160; 68 &#160; China 1,525 &#160; 1,621 &#160; 888 &#160; Germany 2,934 &#160; 2,675 &#160; 1,837 &#160; Japan 87 &#160; 15 &#160; 10 &#160; Mexico 359 &#160; 330 &#160; 200 &#160; Netherlands 105 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Singapore 1,209 &#160; 1,202 &#160; 627 &#160; South Korea 68 &#160; 8 &#160; 8 &#160; Switzerland 165 &#160; 140 &#160; 81 &#160; U.S. 2,562 &#160; 2,004 &#160; 1,490 &#160; Other 288 &#160; 176 &#160; 172 &#160; Total 9,673 &#160; 8,537 &#160; 5,655 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net based on the geographic location of the Company's facilities is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 2021 (In $ millions) Belgium 113 &#160; 65 &#160; Canada 128 &#160; 96 &#160; China 688 &#160; 413 &#160; Germany 937 &#160; 812 &#160; Japan 52 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mexico 52 &#160; 58 &#160; Netherlands 52 &#160; 43 &#160; Singapore 99 &#160; 72 &#160; South Korea 79 &#160; 4 &#160; Switzerland 73 &#160; 18 &#160; U.S. 3,032 &#160; 2,377 &#160; Other 279 &#160; 235 &#160; Total 5,584 &#160; 4,193 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n22. Revenue Recognition \n\nDisaggregated Revenue \n\nIn general, the Company's business segmentation is aligned according to the nature and economic characteristics of its products and customer relationships and provides meaningful disaggregation of each business segment's results of operations. \n\nThe Company manages its Engineered Materials business segment through its project management pipeline, which is comprised of a broad range of projects which are solutions-based and are tailored to each customers' unique needs. Projects are identified and selected based on success rate and may involve a number of different polymers per project for use in multiple end-use applications. Therefore, the Company is agnostic toward products and end-use markets for the Engineered Materials business segment. \n\nThe Company manages its Acetyl Chain business segment by leveraging its ability to sell chemicals externally to end-use markets or downstream to its acetate tow, intermediate chemistry, emulsion polymers, redispersible powders and ethylene vinyl acetate polymers businesses. Decisions to sell externally and geographically or downstream and along the Acetyl Chain are based on market demand, trade flows and maximizing the value of its chemicals. Therefore, the Company's strategic focus is on executing within this integrated chain model and less on driving product-specific revenue. \n\nFurther disaggregation of Net sales by business segment and geographic destination is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In $ millions) Engineered Materials North America \n\n1,197 &#160; 774 &#160; 577 &#160; Europe and Africa \n\n1,538 &#160; 1,155 &#160; 906 &#160; Asia-Pacific \n\n1,180 &#160; 703 &#160; 534 &#160; South America \n\n109 &#160; 86 &#160; 64 &#160; Total \n\n4,024 &#160; 2,718 &#160; 2,081 &#160; Acetyl Chain North America \n\n1,713 &#160; 1,533 &#160; 1,106 &#160; Europe and Africa \n\n1,961 &#160; 1,914 &#160; 1,292 &#160; Asia-Pacific \n\n1,811 &#160; 2,214 &#160; 1,093 &#160; South America \n\n164 &#160; 158 &#160; 83 &#160; Total (1) \n\n5,649 &#160; 5,819 &#160; 3,574 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n______________________________ \n\n(1) Excludes intersegment sales of $ 94 million, $ 75 million and $ 60 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n23.
