Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&#38;D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Gross R&#38;D expenditures $ 968 $ 930 $ 533 Customer reimbursements (182) (223) (57) Net R&#38;D expenditures $ 786 $ 707 $ 476 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet R&#38;D expenditures as a percentage of net sales were 5.0%, 4.8% and 4.7% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company has approximately 7,800 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does not consider any single patent, any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company&#8217;s business groups individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position or future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate. \n\nThe Company owns the &#8220;BorgWarner&#8221; trade name and numerous BORGWARNER trademarks which are material to the Company's business. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe Company&#8217;s reporting segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Technological innovation, application engineering development, quality, price, delivery and program launch support are the primary methods of competition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s major non-OEM competitors are Robert Bosch GmbH, Denso Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd., Magna Powertrain (an operating unit of Magna International Inc.), Valeo, Schaeffler Group and Vitesco Technologies. The Company also competes with certain start-ups in electrification. \n\nIn addition, a number of the Company&#8217;s major OEM customers manufacture, for their own use and for others, products that compete with the Company's products. Other current OEM customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the Company. There is no assurance that the Company&#8217;s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates. \n\nFor many of its products, the Company&#8217;s competitors include suppliers in parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or raw materials subsidies. Also, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to sustain and grow its business requires it to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide. The Company believes the skills, experience, and industry knowledge of its employees significantly benefit its operations and performance. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Compensation Committee oversees human capital management and assesses whether environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) goals and milestones, as appropriate, are effectively reflected in executive compensation.

The safety of the Company&#8217;s employees is vitally important, and the Company is dedicated to continuously improving safety performance. Evidence of the Company&#8217;s dedication is in its results: \n\n&#9702; The Company&#8217;s global workforce accident total recordable incident rate through December 31, 2022 was 0.37, while, in comparison, the top quartile for motor vehicle parts manufacturing was lower than or equal to 1.1, and the mean was 2.4 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (the &#8220;BLS&#8221;). \n\n1 The Company&#8217;s most recent pay equity study was conducted in 2022 based on compensation as of December 31, 2021. The analysis included employees from salaried early-in-career through vice president roles and included employees acquired as part of the Delphi Technologies acquisition. \n\n&#9702; The Company&#8217;s global workforce accident lost time incident rate through December 31, 2022 was 0.18, while in comparison the top quartile for motor vehicle parts manufacturing was lower than or equal to 0.1, and the mean was 0.6 according to the BLS. \n\n&#9702; Additionally, the Company has a formal audited health and safety management system in place at all of its manufacturing and technical centers. \n\nApproximately 13% of the Company&#8217;s U.S. workforce is unionized. These employees, located at one facility in the state of New York, are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in September 2024. Employees at certain international facilities are also unionized. The Company believes the present relations with its workforce to be satisfactory. The Company recognizes that, in many of the locations where it operates, employees have freedom of association rights with third-party organizations such as labor unions. The Company respects and supports those rights, including the right to collective bargaining, in accordance with local laws. \n\nRaw Materials \n\nThe Company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of its products including aluminum, copper, nickel, plastic resins, steel, certain alloy elements and semiconductor chips. Manufacturing operations for each of the Company&#8217;s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil and electricity. \n\nThe Company uses a variety of tactics in an attempt to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary pressures. The Company&#8217;s global procurement organization works to accelerate cost reductions, purchase from lower cost regions, optimize the supply base, mitigate risk and collaborate on its buying activities. In addition, the Company uses long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy programs and limited financial instruments to help control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in 2023 and beyond. Refer to Note 17, &#8220;Financial Instruments,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information related to the Company&#8217;s hedging activities. \n\nFor 2023, the Company believes there will be continued inflationary pressures in certain raw materials, labor and energy. The Company also believes there will continue to be supply constraints related to semiconductor chips. Supplies of other raw materials are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements. \n\nRegulations \n\nThe Company operates in a constantly evolving global regulatory environment and is subject to numerous and varying regulatory requirements for its product performance and material content. The Company&#8217;s practice is to identify potential regulatory and quality risks early in the design and development process and proactively manage them throughout the product lifecycle through the use of routine assessments, protocols, standards, performance measures and audits. New regulations and changes to existing regulations are managed in collaboration with the Company&#8217;s OEM customers and implemented through its global systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations. The Company demonstrates material content compliance through the International Material Data System (&#8220;IMDS&#8221;), which is the automotive industry material data system. In the IMDS, all materials used for automobile manufacturing are archived and maintained to meet the obligations placed on the automobile manufacturers, and thus on their suppliers, by national and international standards, laws and regulations. \n\nThe Company works collaboratively with a number of stakeholder groups including government agencies, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, its customers and its suppliers to proactively engage in federal, state and international public policy processes. \n\nRefer to Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulations on the Company&#8217;s business. Also, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThrough its Internet website (www.borgwarner.com), the Company makes available, free of charge, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed or furnished.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business including our financial performance, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. \n\nRisks related to our strategy \n\nOur Charging Forward strategy may prove unsuccessful. \n\nIn 2021, we announced our strategy to aggressively grow our electrification product portfolio over time through organic investments and technology-focused acquisitions. We believe we are well positioned for the industry&#8217;s anticipated migration to EV. We are targeting revenue from products for pure electric vehicles to be over 25% of total revenue by 2025 and approximately 45% of total revenue by 2030. We believe we are on track to exceed our 2025 organic EV-related sales target and over the last two years have announced or completed five acquisitions. As discussed above, on December 6, 2022, we announced our intention to execute a tax-free spin-off of our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments into a separate, publicly traded company. The intended separation of our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments would be an important next step in furthering our pivot to EV and advancing our vision of a clean, energy-efficient world, while at the same time creating a new, focused company with strong financials to support the new company&#8217;s future. \n\nWe may not meet our goals due to many factors, including any of the risks identified in the paragraph that follows, failure to develop new products that our customers will purchase, and technology changes that could render our products obsolete, or the introduction of new technology to which we do not have access, among other things. Additionally, there is no certainty that we will be able to dispose of certain internal combustion assets on favorable terms, if at all, and the disposition process is expected to consume significant management resources. \n\nWe expect to continue to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance our customer base, geographic representation, and scale to complement our current businesses. We regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities, some of which could be material. While we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our long-term strategy, there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities. Assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence. However, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity can be limited, and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. Assessing a price for potential transactions is inexact, particularly in a market that generally favors sellers and attaches a high multiple or premium on technology. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or will acquire in the future, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. Failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business. \n\nThe failure to realize the expected benefits of acquisitions and other risks associated with acquisitions could adversely affect our business. \n\nThe success of our acquisitions is dependent, in part, on our ability to realize the expected benefits from combining our businesses and businesses that we acquire. To realize these anticipated benefits, both companies must be successfully combined, which is subject to our ability to consolidate operations, corporate cultures and systems and to eliminate redundancies and costs. If we are unsuccessful in combining companies, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Further, there is potential for unknown or inestimable liabilities relating to the acquired businesses. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. \n\nThe combination of independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process that requires significant management attention and resources. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our operations, the inability to maintain or increase our competitive presence, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention to integration matters and/or difficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate cultures. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could have an adverse effect on the combined company. In addition, many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of these factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and additional diversion of management&#8217;s time and energy, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe may not be able to execute dispositions of assets or businesses successfully. \n\nWhen we decide to dispose of assets or a business, we may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. Buyers of the assets or business may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may experience fewer synergies than expected, and the impact of the disposition on our financial results may be larger than projected. \n\nAfter reaching an agreement for the disposition of a business, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in jurisdictions around the world, and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay or prevent the transaction. \n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are subject to periodic impairment evaluations, represent a significant portion of our total assets. An impairment charge on these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe have recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to acquisitions. We periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or macroeconomic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, dispositions, and market capitalization declines may impair these assets, and any of these factors may be exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment either annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The risk of impairment to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is higher during the early years following an acquisition. This is because the fair values of these assets align very closely with what was paid to acquire the reporting units to which these assets are assigned. As a result, the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value (typically referred to as &#8220;headroom&#8221;) is smaller at the time of acquisition. Until this headroom grows over time, due to business growth or lower carrying value of the reporting unit, a relatively small decrease in reporting unit fair value can trigger impairment charges. When impairment charges are triggered, they tend to be material due to the size of the assets involved. Future acquisitions could present similar risks. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. \n\nRisks related to the intended separation of the Fuel Systems and Aftermarket Segments \n\nThe intended separation of our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and may not achieve the expected results. \n\nOn December 6, 2022, we announced our intention to execute a tax-free spin-off of our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments into a separate, publicly traded company (&#8220;NewCo&#8221;). The transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We expect to complete the transaction in late 2023, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including among others, final approval from the BorgWarner Board of Directors, filing and effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, receipt of a tax opinion, satisfactory completion of financing, completion of information and consultations processes with works councils and other employee representative bodies, as required, and receipt of necessary consents and other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the intended transaction or that it will be completed at all. \n\nUnanticipated developments or changes, including but not limited to, changes in the general or financial market conditions, possible delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals, changes in the law, and challenges in executing the intended separation, could delay or prevent the completion of the spin-off, or cause the spin-off to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than initially expected. These or other developments could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off or to realize them on a different timeline than expected. If the spin-off does not occur, we could pursue other transactions involving our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments, including a potential sale. \n\nThe spin-off may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may expose us to additional risks. \n\nWe may not realize the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits of the spin-off. We cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the spin-off will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved. There is no assurance that following the spin-off each separate company will be successful. Whether or not the spin-off is completed, we may face material challenges in connection with the intended separation, including but not limited to, the diversion of management time on matters relating to the spin-off; the impact of having to operate under the terms of any transition service agreements; the impact on our ability to retain talent; and potential impacts on our relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties. In addition, we will incur one-time costs and ongoing costs in connection with, or as a result of, the spin-off, including costs of operating as independent, publicly-traded companies that the separate businesses will no longer be able to share. Those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize. Further, while it is intended that the transaction will be tax-free to the Company&#8217;s stockholders for U.S. \n\nfederal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transaction will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off is ultimately determined to be taxable, either the Company, NewCo, or the Company&#8217;s stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. If we do not realize the anticipated benefits of the spin-off it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nFollowing the intended separation of our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. \n\nWe cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock after the intended separation will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation. The trading price of our common stock may be more volatile around the time of the intended separation. \n\nRisks related to our industry \n\nConditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business. \n\nOur financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry. Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. Economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to OEMs. \n\nWe face strong competition. \n\nWe compete globally with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major OEM customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. Additionally, our competitors include start-ups that may be well funded, with the result that they could have more operational and financial flexibility than we have. A number of our competitors are larger than we are, and some competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Although OEMs have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of major OEM customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. These OEMs could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. Our traditional OEM customers, faced with intense international competition, have continued to expand their global sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our business. In addition, any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to our products, produce similar products at a cost that is lower than our cost, or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. As a result, our products may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors' products, and we may not be able to meet the growing demands of customers. These trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products. \n\nIf we do not respond appropriately, the evolution of the automotive industry could adversely affect our business. \n\nThe automotive industry is increasingly focused on improved vehicle efficiency and reduced emissions, including the development of hybrid and electric vehicles, largely as a result of changing consumer preferences and increasingly stringent global regulatory requirements related to climate change, and of \n\nadvanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially viable, fully automated driving experience. There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car and ride sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. In addition, some industry participants are exploring transportation through alternatives to automobiles. These evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry. While we are focused on driving growth through our ability to capitalize on certain potential trends, such as the move toward hybrid and electric vehicles, some of the focuses and trends are not part of our product line or strategy, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. If we do not continue to innovate and develop, or acquire, new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to OEM and consumer preferences, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. \n\nWe may be subject to potential governmental investigations and related proceedings relating to vehicle emissions standards. \n\nIn recent years, within the automotive industry, there have been governmental investigations and related proceedings relating to alleged or actual violations of vehicle emissions standards. Alleged violations by BorgWarner of existing or future emissions standards could result in government investigations and other legal proceedings, the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, disgorgement of profits, restricted product offerings, reputational harm or a combination of any of those items. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, as previously reported, German authorities announced a diesel defeat device investigation in 2022, which we believe is focused on two of our light vehicle OEM customers, and searched two of our facilities seeking information relating to sources of software for these OEM customers. We are cooperating with that investigation which is ongoing. \n\nRisks related to our business \n\nWe are under substantial pressure from OEMs to reduce the prices of our products. \n\nThere is substantial and continuing pressure on OEMs to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. OEM customers expect annual price reductions in our business. To maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, and streamlined product designs to reduce costs, and we attempt to develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our OEM customers is limited, with cost recovery often less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. Inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on us. \n\nWe continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products and elevated levels of inflation. \n\nWe use a variety of commodities (including aluminum, copper, nickel, plastic resins, steel, other raw materials and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings and bar stock. Beginning in 2021, we have experienced price increases for base metals (e.g., steel, aluminum and nickel), precious metals (e.g., palladium) and raw materials that are primarily used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium and cobalt). Increasing commodity costs negatively impact our operating margins and results. We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures. The discontinuation or lessening of our ability to pass through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business. \n\nFrom time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. If this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions. The same may be true of transportation carriers and energy providers. If these supply interruptions occur, it could adversely affect our business. \n\nIn addition, during 2022, many global economies, including the United States, experienced elevated levels of inflation more generally, which drove an increase in input costs. Following non-contractual negotiations, we reached cost-recovery agreements with various customers in 2022, but these agreements did not enable us to recover 100 percent of our increased costs, and as a result, our operating margins were negatively impacted. While we will continue to negotiate the pass through and recovery of higher costs with our customers, continued increasing levels of inflation could adversely affect our business. \n\nChanges in U.S. administrative policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations, may have an adverse effect on us. \n\nThe United States has maintained tariffs on certain imported steel, aluminum and items originating from China. These tariffs have increased the cost of raw materials and components we purchase. The imposition of tariffs by the United States has resulted in retaliatory tariffs from a number of countries, including China, which increase the cost of products we sell. If the U.S. or other countries impose additional tariffs, that will have a further adverse impact on us. \n\nWe use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. \n\nWe own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Our inability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business and our competitive position. \n\nWe are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) systems. \n\nTo improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing, payroll, and general management operations. If the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nA failure of or disruption in our information technology infrastructure, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely impact our business and operations. \n\nWe rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our IT systems and infrastructure. IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions, including those resulting from natural disasters, cyber-attacks or failures in third-party provided services. Disruptions and attacks on our IT systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information and data and that of third parties, including our employees. Some cyber-attacks depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or carry out disbursement of funds or other frauds, which raise the risks from such \n\nevents and the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. Although we have implemented security policies, processes, and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information, and disruptions of our operations, we have been, and likely will continue to be, subjected to such attacks or disruptions. Future attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, improper use of our systems and networks, access to and manipulation and destruction of our or third-party data, production downtimes, lost revenues, inappropriate disbursement of funds and both internal and external supply shortages. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by such attacks or disruptions in the future. These consequences could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers, lead to claims against us and ultimately adversely affect our business. \n\nOur business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. \n\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide. In particular, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees and employees with engineering, technical and software capabilities in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business. \n\nOur profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties. \n\nThe launch of new business is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch new business, or our inability to accurately estimate the cost to design, develop and launch new business, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. \n\nTo the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business, vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. Such situations could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives and could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor, all of which could result in loss of revenue or loss of market share and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. \n\nPart of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 13% of our U.S. workforce was unionized. We have a domestic collective bargaining agreement for one facility in New York, which expires in September 2024. The workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized. A prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nWork stoppages, production shutdowns and similar events could significantly disrupt our business. \n\nBecause the automotive industry relies heavily on just-in-time delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, a work stoppage or production shutdown at one or more of our manufacturing and assembly facilities could have adverse effects on our business. Similarly, if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage or production shutdown, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in the shutdown of the related manufacturing facilities. A significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to supply \n\nconstraints, such as the constraints experienced in 2021 and 2022 related to semiconductor chips, or due to a work stoppage or production shutdown at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our financial results. \n\nChanges in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets is subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline. Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. Additionally, a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our pension expenses and reduce profitability in the future. \n\nWe also sponsor post-employment medical benefit plans in the U.S. that are unfunded. If medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified, this could have an adverse effect on our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulations that are subject to change and involve significant risks. \n\nOur operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters, and the generation, management, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. The operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result. Through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with evolving interpretations of existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or any new such laws and regulations (including concerns about global climate change and its impact) that may be adopted in the future. Costs associated with failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nOur operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations. \n\nClimate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and certain of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity we purchase, increase costs for use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions or result in an overall increase in costs of raw materials, any one of which could increase our costs, reduce competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Many of our suppliers face similar circumstances. Supply disruptions would raise market rates and jeopardize the continuity of production and could have an adverse effect on our financial results. \n\nClimate changes could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials within our supply chain, and could also increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities. \n\nWe have liabilities related to environmental, product warranties, litigation and other claims. \n\nWe and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws, and, as such, may be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at such sites. While responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at such sites is typically shared among potentially responsible parties based on an allocation formula, we could have greater liability under applicable statutes. Refer to Note 21, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion. \n\nWe provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products. Under these product warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, auto manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product warranty claims. A recall claim brought against us, or a product warranty claim brought against us, could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines, which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements. \n\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury, product liability, environmental and employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no, or insufficient, insurance coverage could adversely affect our business. \n\nCompliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect our operating results. \n\nWe have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. Compliance-related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws could adversely affect our business. We have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such laws; however, there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners, joint venture partners, or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions and/or fines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and reputation. \n\nChanges that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings, and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, additional limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or other matters related to climate change and other changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate. \n\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business. \n\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the inability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization. \n\nIf taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. Our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. We have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters. These audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties, and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable. \n\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations. \n\nWe have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including Europe, Asia, and the Americas. For 2022, approximately 81% of our consolidated net sales were outside the U.S. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes, international terrorism and other factors that may be discrete to a particular country or geography. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging, burdensome and expensive. \n\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. Dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses and capital expenditures. The local currency is typically the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries. Significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars could adversely affect our business. Additionally, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses&#8217; operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. \n\nBecause we are a U.S. holding company, one significant source of our funds is distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our non-U.S. subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into U.S. Dollars or to make payments outside the country. This could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption. \n\nOur business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic, political, and market conditions. \n\nMaintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The automotive supply market in China is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. As the Chinese market evolves, we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. In addition, our business in China is sensitive to economic, political, social and market conditions that drive sales volumes in China. If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese \n\nmarket or if vehicle sales in China decrease, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. \n\nA downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets. \n\nChanges in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted and our cost of borrowing or the interest rate for any subsequently issued debt would likely increase. \n\nOur revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. The interest cost on our revolving credit agreement is based on a rating grid. Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing. \n\nWe could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and to optimize our product portfolio and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions. \n\nWe have initiated and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve the competitiveness of our business and sustain our margin profile, optimize our product portfolio or create an optimal legal entity structure. We may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nRisks related to our customers \n\nWe rely on sales to major customers. \n\nWe rely on sales to OEMs around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands. Supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by us. We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. Among other things, the level of production orders we receive is dependent on the ability of our OEM customers to design and sell products that consumers desire to purchase. If actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including non-renewal of purchase orders, a customer's financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons, it could adversely affect our business. \n\nSome of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide sales in 2022 to Ford and Volkswagen constituted approximately 13% and 8% of our 2022 consolidated net sales, respectively. Sales to the Company&#8217;s top ten customers represented 62% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nWe are sensitive to the effects of our major customers&#8217; labor relations. \n\nAll three of our primary North American customers, Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors, have major union contracts with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. Because of domestic OEMs&#8217; dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at OEMs&#8217; facilities. Similarly, a majority of our global customers' operations outside of North America are also represented by various unions. Any extended work stoppage at one or more of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nRisks related to our suppliers \n\nWe could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers. \n\nIn an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a result, we remain dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. We select suppliers based on total value (including total landed price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations. \n\nHowever, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations, industry shortages, labor or social unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes, government actions, riots, wars, such as Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, sabotage, cyber-attacks, non-conforming parts, acts of terrorism, &#8220;Acts of God,&#8221; or other problems that our suppliers experience will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. During 2021, and to a lesser extent in 2022, trailing impacts of the shutdowns and production declines related, in part, to COVID-19, created supply constraints of certain components, particularly semiconductor chips. These supply constraints have had, and are expected to continue to have, significant impacts on global industry production levels. If we experience a prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and cannot procure the components from other sources, we may be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations. In addition, with fewer sources of supply for certain components, each supplier may perceive that it has greater leverage and, therefore, some ability to seek higher prices from us at a time that we face substantial pressure from OEMs to reduce the prices of our products, which could adversely affect our customer relations and business. \n\nSuppliers&#8217; economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business. \n\nRapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes; our need to seek price reductions from our suppliers as a result of the substantial pressure we face from OEMs to reduce the prices of our products; credit tightness; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; raw material, commodity, tariffs, transportation, and energy price escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with little advance notice. These conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. In certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion, we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines. We cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business. \n\nWe are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties. \n\nWe engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. We are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and, therefore, be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts. \n\nRisks related to COVID-19 \n\nWe face risks related to COVID-19 that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. \n\nThe impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy. In 2022, COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions caused intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations. For a significant portion of the second quarter of 2022, China imposed lockdowns in many cities due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in the region, which contributed to a decline in industry production in China during the quarter. As a result, we experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales. If the global economic effects caused by COVID-19 continue or increase, overall customer demand may decrease, which could further adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, traditional functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. \n\nDuring 2021, and to a lesser extent in 2022, trailing impacts of the shutdowns and production declines related, in part, to COVID-19 created supply constraints of certain components, particularly semiconductor chips. These supply constraints have had and are expected to continue to have significant impacts on global industry production levels. Due to the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, at this time, we are unable to predict the extent to which COVID-19, including its existing and future variants that may emerge, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frames, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of COVID-19, including variants, its severity, COVID-19 containment and treatment efforts, including the availability, efficacy, and acceptance of the vaccines and any related restrictions on travel. Furthermore, the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer production, including any recession resulting from COVID-19, are uncertain and unpredictable. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of COVID-19 would have a further material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, although the full extent and duration are uncertain. \n\nOther risks \n\nA variety of other factors could adversely affect our business. \n\nAny of the following could materially and adversely affect our business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start-up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs; low levels of utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others; global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation; and the impact of fire, flood, or other natural disasters including pandemics and quarantines. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n&#160; \n\nBorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;BorgWarner&#8221;) is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. BorgWarner&#8217;s products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles (&#8220;SUVs&#8221;), vans and light trucks). The Company&#8217;s products are also sold to other OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). The Company also manufactures and sells its products to certain tier one vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in Europe, the Americas and Asia and is an original equipment supplier to nearly every major automotive OEM in the world. \n\nCharging Forward - Electrification Portfolio Strategy \n\nIn 2021, the Company announced its strategy to aggressively grow its electrification product portfolio over time through organic investments and technology-focused acquisitions. The Company believes it is well positioned for the industry&#8217;s anticipated migration to electric vehicles (&#8220;EV&#8221;). The Company is targeting its revenue from products for pure electric vehicles to be over 25% of its total revenue by 2025 and approximately 45% of its total revenue by 2030. The Company believes it is on track to exceed its 2025 organic EV-related sales target and over the last two years has announced or completed five acquisitions. On December 6, 2022, the Company announced its intention to execute a tax-free spin-off of its Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments into a separate, publicly traded company. The intended separation of its Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments would support optimizing the Company&#8217;s combustion portfolio and advancing its electrification journey, while at the same time creating a new, focused company that would be able to pursue growth opportunities in alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, and in Aftermarket. The Company expects to complete the transaction in late 2023, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions. In 2022, the Company&#8217;s EV-related revenue was approximately $870 million, or 6%, of its total revenue. Based on new business awards and actions announced to date, the Company believes it is on track to achieve $4.3 billion of EV revenue by 2025. \n\nAcquisitions \n\nHubei Surpass Sun Electric Charging Business \n\nOn September 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement under which BorgWarner will acquire the electric vehicle solution, smart grid and smart energy businesses of Hubei Surpass Sun Electric. The transaction has an enterprise value up to &#165;410 million ($60 million), of which approximately &#165;267 million ($39 million) will be delivered at or soon after closing, and up to &#165;143 million ($21 million) could be paid in the form of contingent payments over approximately two years following the closing. The acquisition complements the Company&#8217;s existing European and North American charging footprint by adding a presence in China. The transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nDrivetek AG \n\nOn December 1, 2022, the Company acquired Drivetek AG, an engineering and product development company located in Switzerland. This acquisition strengthens the Company&#8217;s power electronics capabilities in auxiliary inverters, which it expects to accelerate the growth of the High Voltage eFan business. The Company paid &#8355;27 million ($29 million) at closing, and up to &#8355;10 million ($10 million) could be paid in the form of contingent payments over the three years following closing. \n\nRhombus Energy Solutions \n\nOn July 29, 2022, the Company acquired Rhombus Energy Solutions (&#8220;Rhombus&#8221;), a provider of charging solutions in the North American market. The acquisition complements the Company&#8217;s existing European charging footprint to accelerate organic growth and adds North American regional presence to its charging business. The Company paid $131 million at closing, and up to $30 million could be paid in the form of contingent payments over the three years following closing. \n\nSantroll Automotive Components \n\nOn March 31, 2022, the Company acquired Santroll Automotive Components (&#8220;Santroll&#8221;), a carve-out of Santroll Electric Auto&#8217;s eMotor business. The acquisition strengthens the Company&#8217;s vertical integration, scale and portfolio breadth in light vehicle eMotors while allowing for increased speed to market. The total final consideration was $192 million, which reflects a reduction of approximately $20 million in the base purchase price since the acquisition closing date resulting from an amendment to the Equity Transfer Agreement and finalization of post-closing adjustments. The consideration includes approximately &#165;1.0 billion ($152 million) of base purchase price and &#165;0.25 billion ($40 million) of originally estimated earn-out payments. The Company paid approximately $157 million of base purchase price in the year ended December 31, 2022 and expects to recapture approximately $5 million of post-closing adjustments through a reduction of the payment of the second earn-out. As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s estimate of the earn-out payments was approximately $21 million. The net amount of the earn-out payment and post-closing adjustments is recorded in Other current liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nAKASOL \n\nOn June 4, 2021, the Company completed a voluntary public takeover offer for shares of AKASOL AG (&#8220;AKASOL&#8221;), resulting in ownership of 89% of AKASOL&#8217;s outstanding shares. The Company paid approximately &#8364;648 million ($788 million) to settle the offer. During 2021, the Company increased its ownership to 93% through the subsequent purchase of additional shares. On February 10, 2022, the Company completed a merger squeeze-out process (the &#8220;Squeeze Out&#8221;) to obtain the remaining shares, resulting in 100% ownership. The acquisition further strengthens BorgWarner&#8217;s commercial vehicle and industrial electrification capabilities, which positions the Company to capitalize on what it believes to be a fast-growing battery module and pack market. \n\nRefer to Note 2, &#8220;Acquisitions and Dispositions,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. Results of operations for these acquisitions are included in the Company&#8217;s financial information following their respective dates of acquisition. \n\nKey Trends and Economic Factors \n\nCOVID-19 and Supplier Disruptions. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy. Recent COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in the Company&#8217;s supply chain and local manufacturing operations. For a significant portion of the second quarter of 2022, China imposed lock-downs in many cities due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in the region, which contributed to a decline in industry production in China during the quarter. The Company also continues to face supplier disruptions due to a global semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. Further, actions taken by Russia in Ukraine have impacted the automotive industry particularly in Europe, including the Company&#8217;s suppliers, its customers and its operations more generally. In 2022, the Company wound down its Aftermarket operation in Russia, which involved purchasing the noncontrolling interest of a joint venture. The Russia operations were not material to the Company&#8217;s financial statements. \n\nCommodities and Other Inflationary Impacts. Prices for commodities remain volatile, and since the beginning of 2021, the Company has experienced price increases for base metals (e.g., steel, aluminum and nickel), precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are primarily used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium and cobalt). In addition, many global economies, including the United States, are experiencing elevated levels of inflation more generally, which is driving an increase in other input costs. As a result, the Company has experienced, and is continuing to experience, higher costs. \n\nIn 2022, following non-contractual negotiations, the Company reached agreement for the pass through and recovery of higher costs with various customers. These agreements did not enable the Company to recover 100 percent of its increased costs, and as a result, the Company&#8217;s operating margins were negatively impacted. \n\nForeign Currency Impacts. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in 2022 relative to major foreign currencies, including the Euro, Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi, and related translation of these currencies to the U.S. Dollar, unfavorably impacted the Company&#8217;s net sales, earnings and cash flows. Continued significant fluctuations of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar may further negatively impact the Company&#8217;s financial results. \n\nOutlook \n\nThe Company expects global industry production to be flat to a modest increase year over year in 2023. The Company also expects net new business-related sales growth, due to the increased penetration of BorgWarner products and increasing electric vehicle revenue, to drive a sales increase in excess of the growth in industry production outlook. As a result, the Company expects increased revenue in 2023, excluding the impact of foreign currencies. The Company expects the earnings benefit of this revenue growth to be partially offset by a planned increase in electrification-related Research &#38; Development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) expenditures during 2023. This planned R&#38;D increase is to support growth in the Company&#8217;s electric vehicle-related products and is primarily related to supporting the launch of recently awarded programs. \n\nThe Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. There are several trends that are driving the Company&#8217;s long-term growth that management expects to continue, \n\nincluding adoption of product offerings for electrified vehicles and increasingly stringent global emissions standards that support demand for the Company&#8217;s products driving vehicle efficiency. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nA detailed comparison of the Company&#8217;s 2020 operating results to its 2021 operating results can be found in the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the Company&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 15, 2022. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s operating results: ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Net sales % of net sales % of net sales Air Management $ 7,129 45.1 % $ 6,820 46.0 % e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain 5,625 35.6 5,086 34.3 Fuel Systems 2,314 14.6 2,237 15.1 Aftermarket 1,285 8.2 1,212 8.2 Inter-segment eliminations (552) (3.5) (517) (3.5) Total net sales 15,801 100.0 14,838 100.0 Cost of sales 12,700 80.4 11,983 80.8 Gross profit 3,101 19.6 2,855 19.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses - R&#38;D, net 786 5.0 707 4.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses - Other 824 5.2 753 5.1 Restructuring expense 59 0.4 163 1.1 Other operating expense, net 58 0.4 81 0.5 Operating income 1,374 8.7 1,151 7.8 Equity in affiliates&#8217; earnings, net of tax (38) (0.2) (48) (0.3) Unrealized loss on debt and equity securities 73 0.5 362 2.4 Interest expense, net 52 0.3 93 0.6 Other postretirement income (31) (0.2) (45) (0.3) Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest 1,318 8.3 789 5.3 Provision for income taxes 292 1.8 150 1.0 Net earnings 1,026 6.5 639 4.3 Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax 82 0.5 102 0.7 Net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ 944 6.0 % $ 537 3.6 % Earnings per share attributable to BorgWarner Inc. &#8212; diluted $ 3.99 $ 2.24 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales \n\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $15,801 million, an increase of $963 million, or 6%, from the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by the following: \n\n&#8226; Favorable volume, mix and net new business increased sales approximately $1,235 million, or 8%. This increase was primarily driven by higher weighted average market production as estimated by the Company, which was up approximately 4% from the year ended December 31, 2021. The remaining increase primarily reflects the sales growth above market production, which the Company believes reflects higher demand for its products. Weighted average market production reflects light and commercial vehicle production as reported by IHS weighted for the Company&#8217;s geographic exposure, as estimated by the Company. \n\n&#8226; Fluctuations in foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $961 million primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Chinese Renminbi and Korean Won relative to the U.S. Dollar. \n\n&#8226; Customer pricing increased net sales by approximately $622 million. This includes an increase of approximately $585 million related to recoveries from the Company&#8217;s customers of material cost inflation arising from non-contractual commercial negotiations with those customers and normal contractual customer commodity pass-through arrangements. \n\n&#8226; Acquisitions, primarily AKASOL, contributed $154 million in additional sales during the year ended December 31, 2022. In December 2021, the Company sold its Water Valley, Mississippi manufacturing facility, which accounted for $177 million of net sales during the year ended December 31, 2021 that did not recur in 2022. \n\nCost of sales and gross profit \n\nCost of sales and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales were $12,700 million and 80.4%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $11,983 million and 80.8%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by the following: \n\n&#8226; Higher sales volume, mix and net new business increased cost of sales by approximately $1,051 million. \n\n&#8226; Fluctuations in foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in cost of sales of approximately $780 million primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi relative to the U.S. Dollar. \n\n&#8226; Cost of sales was also impacted by material cost inflation of approximately $674 million arising from non-contractual commercial negotiations with the Company&#8217;s suppliers and normal contractual supplier commodity pass-through arrangements. This impact was partially offset by $302 million of supply chain savings initiatives. \n\n&#8226; In 2021, the Company recorded a higher warranty provision due to an unfavorable customer warranty settlement that resulted in cumulative charges of $124 million that did not repeat in 2022. \n\nGross profit and gross margin were $3,101 million and 19.6%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $2,855 million and 19.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the factors discussed above. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) \n\nSG&#38;A for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,610 million as compared to $1,460 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. SG&#38;A as a percentage of net sales was 10.2% and 9.8% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in SG&#38;A was primarily attributable to: \n\n&#8226; Increased research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) costs of $79 million. R&#38;D costs, net of customer reimbursements, were 5.0% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 4.8% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in R&#38;D costs, net of customer reimbursements, was primarily due to increasing net investment related to the Company&#8217;s electrification product portfolio. The Company will continue to invest in R&#38;D programs, which are necessary to support short- and long-term growth. The Company&#8217;s current long-term expectation for R&#38;D spending is in the range of 5.0% to 5.5% of net sales. \n\n&#8226; Increased administrative expenses of $34 million, primarily related to IT and travel. \n\n&#8226; Increased employee-related costs of $29 million, primarily related to incentive compensation. \n\nRestructuring expense was $59 million and $163 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to employee benefit costs. Refer to Note 4 &#8220;Restructuring&#8221; to \n\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company approved individual restructuring actions that primarily related to specific reductions in headcount. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $18 million of restructuring expense related to these actions. \n\nIn February 2020, the Company announced a $300 million restructuring plan to address existing structural costs. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $36 million and $103 million of restructuring expense related to this plan, respectively. Cumulatively, the Company has incurred $287 million of restructuring charges related to this plan. As of December 31, 2022, the plan was substantially complete. The resulting annual gross savings are expected to be in excess of $100 million and are being utilized to sustain overall operating margin profile and cost competitiveness. \n\nOther operating expense, net was $58 million and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, merger, acquisition and divestiture expenses, net were $40 million and $50 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded merger, acquisition and divestiture expense of $54 million primarily related to professional fees associated with the intended separation of its Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments. This merger, acquisition and divestiture expense was partially offset by a $14 million gain related to a change in estimate of the expected earn-out estimate associated with the Santroll acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded merger, acquisition and divestiture expense of $50 million primarily related to professional fees associated with the acquisition of AKASOL, professional fees for integration and other support associated with the Company&#8217;s acquisition of Delphi Technologies and other specific acquisition and disposition initiatives. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million in connection with the sale of its interest in BorgWarner Romeo Power LLC (&#8220;Romeo JV&#8221;), in which the Company owned a 60% interest. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $30 million to remove an indefinite-lived trade name as the Company no longer plans to utilize this trade name in the business. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded pre-tax losses of $22 million on the sale of its Water Valley, Mississippi facility and $7 million in connection with the sale of an e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain technical center in Europe. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an additional pre-tax loss of $9 million related to a change in estimate of contingent consideration to be received for the sale of its Water Valley, Mississippi facility. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $14 million to reduce its carrying value of an indefinite-lived trade name to the fair value. \n\nOther operating expense, net is primarily comprised of items included within the subtitle &#8220;Non-comparable items impacting the Company&#8217;s earnings per diluted share and net earnings&#8221; below. \n\nEquity in affiliates&#8217; earnings, net of tax was $38 million and $48 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This line item is driven by the results of the Company&#8217;s unconsolidated joint ventures. \n\nUnrealized loss on debt and equity securities was $73 million and $362 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This line item reflects the net unrealized gains or losses recognized related to valuing the Company&#8217;s investments at fair value. The 2022 amount is primarily related to an unrealized loss of $45 million recognized on debt securities and an unrealized loss of $39 \n\nmillion related to the Company&#8217;s investment in Romeo Power, Inc (&#8220;Romeo&#8221;). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Wolfspeed, Inc. (&#8220;Wolfspeed&#8221;) as part of which the Company invested $500 million in convertible debt securities of Wolfspeed. The 2021 amount was primarily related to the Company&#8217;s investment in Romeo. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold all of its remaining investment in Romeo. For further details, refer to Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 2, &#8220;Acquisitions and Dispositions,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. \n\nInterest expense, net was $52 million and $93 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest rates on cash and cash equivalents balances and lower expense related to the Company&#8217;s cross-currency swaps. In addition, in 2021, the Company incurred a $20 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the early repayment of its &#8364;500 million 1.800% senior notes settled on June 18, 2021. \n\nOther postretirement income was $31 million and $45 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in other postretirement income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to higher interest cost in 2022. \n\nProvision for income taxes was $292 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulting in an effective tax rate of 22%. This compared to $150 million or 19% for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nIn 2022, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits of $33 million, primarily related to a reduction in certain unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest related to a matter for which the statute of limitations had lapsed and favorable provision-to-return adjustments. \n\nIn 2021, the Company recognized a $55 million tax benefit related to a reduction in certain unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest related to a matter for which the statute of limitations had lapsed. In addition, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $20 million related to an increase in its deferred tax assets as a result of an increase in the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) tax rate from 19% to 25%. This rate change was enacted in June 2021 and becomes effective April 2023. Further, a net discrete tax benefit of $36 million was recognized, primarily related to changes to certain withholding rates applied to unremitted earnings. \n\nFor further details, see Note 7, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. \n\nNet earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax of $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $20 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in industry production in China related to COVID-19. \n\nNon-comparable items impacting the Company&#8217;s earnings per diluted share and net earnings \n\nThe Company&#8217;s earnings per diluted share were $3.99 and $2.24 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The non-comparable items presented below are calculated after tax using the corresponding effective tax rate discrete to each item and the weighted average number of diluted shares for each of the years then ended. The Company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non-comparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share: ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Non-comparable items: 2022 2021 Restructuring expense $ (0.20) $ (0.58) Merger, acquisition and divestiture expense (0.15) (0.19) Asset impairments and lease modifications (0.13) (0.05) Gain (loss) on sales of businesses 0.04 (0.13) Other (0.06) 0.01 Unrealized loss on debt and equity securities (0.25) (1.15) Customer warranty settlement 1 \n\n&#8212; (0.26) Loss on debt extinguishment &#8212; (0.06) Tax adjustments 2 \n\n0.14 0.50 Total impact of non-comparable items per share &#8212; diluted: $ (0.61) $ (1.91) ##TABLE_END\n\n_____________________ \n\n##TABLE_START 1 \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reached an agreement with a customer to fully resolve a warranty claim and the Company recognized cumulative charges in the amount of $124 million in connection with the warranty claim. Refer to Note 13, &#8220;Product Warranty,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. \n\nIn 2022, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits of $33 million, primarily related to a reduction in certain unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest related to a matter for which the statute of limitations had lapsed and favorable provision-to-return adjustments. In 2021, the Company recognized discrete reductions to tax expense of $124 million. These reductions primarily included a $55 million tax benefit related to the lapse of the statute of limitations for a tax matter, a $20 million benefit related to an increase in deferred tax assets associated with an increase in the UK tax rate, and a $49 million of tax benefit primarily related to changes to certain withholding rates applied to unremitted earnings and other tax adjustments. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nResults by Reporting Segment \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is aggregated into four reporting segments: Air Management, e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain, Fuel Systems and Aftermarket. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company announced that the starter and alternator business, previously reported in its e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment, would transition to the Aftermarket segment. The Company also announced that the canisters and fuel delivery modules business, previously reported in its Air Management segment, would transition to the Fuel Systems segment. Both of these transitions were completed during the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company moved its battery systems business, previously reported in its Air Management segment, to the e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment. The reporting segment disclosures have been updated accordingly which included recasting prior period information for the new reporting structure. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated the definition of its measure of segment income or loss to exclude the impact of intangible asset amortization expense. The Company believes this change improves comparability of ongoing operations given the increasing operating margin impact of intangible asset amortization arising from the Company&#8217;s merger and acquisition activity. The prior period information disclosed below has been recast to reflect this change. Further, the Company renamed its measure of segment income or loss from Segment Adjusted EBIT to Segment Adjusted Operating Income. \n\nSegment Adjusted Operating Income is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. Segment Adjusted Operating Income is comprised of operating income adjusted for restructuring, merger, acquisition and divestiture expense, intangible asset amortization expense, impairment charges and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss. The Company believes Segment Adjusted Operating Income is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of its reporting segments. \n\nSegment Adjusted Operating Income excludes certain corporate costs, which primarily represent headquarters&#8217; expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments. Corporate expenses not allocated to Segment Adjusted Operating Income were $289 million and $302 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in corporate expenses in 2022 is primarily related to cost reductions driven by synergies from acquisitions. \n\nThe following table presents net sales and Segment Adjusted Operating Income for the Company&#8217;s reporting segments: ##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2022 Year ended December 31, 2021 (in millions) Net sales Segment Adjusted Operating Income % margin Net sales Segment Adjusted Operating Income % margin Air Management $ 7,129 $ 1,068 15.0 % $ 6,820 $ 1,064 15.6 % e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain 5,625 379 6.7 % 5,086 458 9.0 % Fuel Systems 2,314 249 10.8 % 2,237 235 10.5 % Aftermarket 1,285 196 15.3 % 1,212 164 13.5 % Inter-segment eliminations (552) &#8212; (517) &#8212; Totals $ 15,801 $ 1,892 $ 14,838 $ 1,921 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Air Management segment&#8217;s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $309 million, or 5%, and Segment Adjusted Operating Income increased $4 million from the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $504 million primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi relative to the U.S. Dollar. The increase excluding the impact of foreign currencies was primarily due to approximately $514 million of volume, mix and net new business driven by increased demand for the Company&#8217;s products and higher weighted average market production compared to the prior year and approximately $277 million from non-contractual commercial negotiations with the Company&#8217;s customers and normal contractual customer commodity pass-through arrangements. Segment Adjusted Operating margin was 15.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 15.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Segment Adjusted Operating margin decrease was primarily due to higher commodity, labor and energy costs, which were partially offset by the impact of higher sales. \n\nThe e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment&#8217;s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $539 million, or 11%, and Segment Adjusted Operating Income decreased $79 million, or 17%, from the year ended December 31, 2021. Acquisitions, primarily AKASOL, contributed $151 million in additional sales during the year ended December 31, 2022. In December 2021, the Company sold its Water Valley, Mississippi manufacturing facility, which accounted for $177 million of net sales during the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $283 million primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Chinese Renminbi and Korean Won relative to the U.S. Dollar. The increase excluding these items was primarily due to approximately $507 million of volume, mix and net new business driven by increased demand for the Company&#8217;s products and higher weighted average market production compared to the prior year and approximately $221 million from non-contractual commercial negotiations with the Company&#8217;s customers and normal contractual customer commodity pass-through arrangements. Segment Adjusted Operating margin was 6.7% in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 9.0% in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Segment \n\nAdjusted Operating margin decrease was primarily due to approximately $137 million of increased investments in R&#38;D. \n\nThe Fuel Systems segment&#8217;s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $77 million, or 3%, and Segment Adjusted Operating Income increased $14 million, or 6.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $132 million primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, British Pound and Chinese Renminbi relative to the U.S. Dollar. The increase excluding the impact of foreign currencies was primarily due to approximately $147 million of volume, mix and net new business driven by higher weighted average market production compared to the prior year and approximately $55 million from non-contractual commercial negotiations with the Company&#8217;s customers and normal contractual customer commodity pass-through arrangements. Segment Adjusted Operating margin was 10.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 10.5% in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Segment Adjusted Operating margin increase was primarily due to higher sales. \n\nThe Aftermarket segment&#8217;s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $73 million, or 6%, and Segment Adjusted Operating Income increased $32 million, or 19.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign currencies resulted in a year-over-year decrease in sales of approximately $42 million primarily due to the weakening of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. The increase excluding the impact of foreign currencies was primarily due to approximately $67 million of volume, mix and net new business driven by increased demand for the Company&#8217;s products and approximately $32 million of pricing. Segment Adjusted Operating margin was 15.3% in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 13.5% in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Segment Adjusted Operating margin increase was primarily due to the increased pricing and the benefit of higher volumes. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe Company maintains various liquidity sources, including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of its multi-currency revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had liquidity of $3,333 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalent balances of $1,333 million and an undrawn revolving credit facility of $2,000 million. The Company was in full compliance with its covenants under the revolving credit facility and had full access to its undrawn revolving credit facility. Debt maturities through the end of 2023 total $62 million. Given the Company&#8217;s strong liquidity position, management believes that it will have sufficient liquidity and will maintain compliance with all covenants through at least the next 12 months. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, cash balances of $1,084 million were held by the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries outside of the United States. Cash and cash equivalents held by these subsidiaries are used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments, including acquisitions. The majority of cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States is available for repatriation. The Company uses its U.S. liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes, including but not limited to debt service, share repurchases, dividend distributions, acquisitions and other corporate expenses. \n\nThe Company has a $2.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, which includes a feature that allows the facility to be increased by $1.0 billion with bank group approval. This facility matures in March 2025. The credit facility agreement contains customary events of default and one key financial covenant, which is a debt-to-EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s commercial paper program allows the Company to issue $2.0 billion of short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes under the limits of its multi-currency revolving credit facility. Under this program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nThe total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed $2.0 billion. \n\nIn addition to the credit facility, the Company&#8217;s universal shelf registration provides the ability to issue various debt and equity instruments subject to market conditions. \n\nOn February 9, 2022, April 27, 2022, July 28, 2022 and November 10, 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.17 per share of common stock. These dividends were paid on March 15, 2022, June 15, 2022, September 15, 2022 and December 15, 2022, respectively. \n\nFrom a credit quality perspective, the Company has a credit rating of BBB+ from Fitch Ratings, BBB from Standard &#38; Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's. The current outlook from each of Fitch, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s is stable. None of the Company&#8217;s debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings. \n\nCash Flows \n\nOperating Activities \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 OPERATING Net earnings $ 1,026 $ 639 Adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash flows from operations: Depreciation and tooling amortization 624 684 Intangible asset amortization 97 88 Restructuring expense, net of cash paid 45 123 Stock-based compensation expense 75 62 (Gain) loss on sales of businesses (15) 29 Loss on debt extinguishment &#8212; 20 Unrealized loss on debt and equity securities 73 362 Deferred income tax benefit (65) (180) Other non-cash adjustments (1) (22) Net earnings adjustments to reconcile to net cash flows from operations 1,859 1,805 Retirement plan contributions (26) (30) Changes in assets and liabilities: Receivables (564) (59) Inventories (215) (268) Accounts payable and accrued expenses 438 (134) Other assets and liabilities 77 (8) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,569 $ 1,306 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,569 million and $1,306 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges and improved working capital. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 INVESTING Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays $ (723) $ (666) Capital expenditures for damage to property, plant and equipment &#8212; (2) Insurance proceeds received for damage to property, plant and equipment &#8212; 5 Payments for businesses acquired, net of cash and restricted cash acquired (312) (759) Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash divested 27 22 Proceeds from settlement of net investment hedges, net 40 11 Payments for investments in debt and equity securities, net (473) (20) Proceeds from asset disposals and other, net 23 14 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,418) $ (1,395) ##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,418 million and $1,395 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the Company acquired Rhombus Energy Solutions, Santroll Automotive Components and Drivetek AG. Additionally, in 2022, the Company invested $500 million in Wolfspeed convertible debt securities. These impacts were partially offset by proceeds related to the liquidation of the Company&#8217;s investment in Romeo Power, Inc., the sale of the Company&#8217;s 60% interest in BorgWarner Romeo Power LLC and proceeds from net investment hedges. As a percentage of sales, capital expenditures were 4.6% and 4.5% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 FINANCING Net decrease in notes payable $ &#8212; $ (8) Additions to debt 5 1,286 Repayments of debt, including current portion (13) (699) Payments for debt issuance costs &#8212; (11) Payments for purchase of treasury stock (240) &#8212; Payments for stock-based compensation items (18) (15) Purchase of noncontrolling interest (59) (33) Dividends paid to BorgWarner stockholders (161) (162) Dividends paid to noncontrolling stockholders (81) (72) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (567) $ 286 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $567 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $286 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to the $240 million of BorgWarner share repurchases, $161 million in dividends paid to the Company&#8217;s stockholders, $57 million paid to settle the AKASOL Squeeze Out and purchase the remaining outstanding shares and $81 million in dividends paid to noncontrolling stockholders of the Company&#8217;s consolidated joint ventures. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s significant cash requirements for contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022, primarily consisted of the principal and interest payments on its notes payable and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease obligations, capital spending obligations and purchase obligations. The principal amount of notes payable and long-term debt was $4,196 million as of December 31, 2022. The projected interest payments over the terms of that debt were $1,052 million as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 14, &#8220;Notes Payable and Debt,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, non-cancelable lease obligations were $239 million. Refer to Note 22, &#8220;Leases and Commitments,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. Capital spending obligations were $241 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\nOn November 16, 2022, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Wolfspeed in which the Company invested $500 million in Wolfspeed&#8217;s convertible debt securities and simultaneously entered into an agreement under which Wolfspeed agreed to provide a silicon carbide manufacturing capacity corridor to the Company. Under this agreement, beginning in 2024, the Company will purchase silicon carbide parts with an aggregate total price equal to or greater than the corridor amount totaling a minimum of $184 million, annually through 2029. \n\nManagement believes that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy the Company&#8217;s cash needs for its current level of operations and its planned operations for the foreseeable future. Management will continue to balance the Company&#8217;s needs for organic growth, inorganic growth, debt reduction, cash conservation and return of cash to shareholders. \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \n\nThe Company&#8217;s policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2022, all legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed $22 million, $24 million and $174 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On October 1, 2020, as a result of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company assumed all of the retirement-related liabilities of Delphi Technologies, the most significant of which was the Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme (the &#8220;Scheme&#8221;) in the United Kingdom. On December 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Heads of Terms Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the Trustees of the Scheme related to the future funding of the Scheme. Under the Agreement, the Company eliminated the prior schedule of contributions between Delphi Technologies and the Scheme in exchange for a $137 million (&#163;100 million) one-time contribution into the Scheme Plan by December 31, 2020, which was paid on December 15, 2020. The Agreement also contained other provisions regarding the implementation of a revised asset investment strategy as well as a funding progress test that will be performed every three years to determine if additional contributions need to be made into the Scheme by the Company. \n\nThe Company expects to contribute a total of $20 million to $30 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2023. Of the $20 million to $30 million in projected 2023 contributions, $7 million are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary. \n\nThe funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $173 million and $184 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the net unfunded position was a result of a lower projected benefit obligation which is primarily due to actuarial gains during the period. The main driver of these gains was the increase of 2.97% in the weighted average discount rate for Non-U.S. plans. Of the total net unfunded amounts, $34 million and $89 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is no tax deduction allowed under the \n\napplicable regulations to fund the plans; hence, the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due. \n\nOther postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Company&#8217;s U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of $37 million and $54 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future. \n\nRefer to Note 18, &#8220;Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. \n\n&#160; \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nContingencies \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company&#8217;s management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. An adverse outcome could, nonetheless, be material to the results of operations or cash flows. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nThe Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (&#8220;PRPs&#8221;) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;Superfund&#8221;) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 26 such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula. \n\nThe Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter. \n\nRefer to Note 21, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the Company&#8217;s environmental liability. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company&#8217;s most critical accounting policies are discussed below. \n\nBusiness combinations The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities, including third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories, and actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition. If goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit, the Company utilizes a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined. Costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred. \n\nAcquired intangible assets include customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. The Company estimates the fair value of acquired intangible assets using various valuation techniques. The primary valuation techniques used include forms of the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation methods. Under these valuation approaches, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions from a market participant perspective which may include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, royalty rates, obsolescence factors, contributory asset charges, customer attrition and discount rates. Under the multi-period excess earnings method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset, in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets that are necessary to realize those benefits. The intangible asset&#8217;s estimated earnings are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying estimated earnings from contributory assets. When the Company estimates fair value using the relief-from-royalty method, it calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets. Assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings. \n\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions, fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings. \n\nFuture changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s financial statements in any given year. \n\nImpairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under ASC Topic 360. In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. \n\nManagement believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of long-lived assets include changes in the industries in which the Company operates, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition and advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability. \n\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a quantitative analysis. The qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. Using this qualitative assessment, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition, restructuring or disposal activity or to refresh the fair values, the Company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, the Company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a quantitative analysis on each reporting unit to refresh its respective fair value. Prior to 2022, the estimated fair value was determined based on the income approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue, profitability, capital requirements and discount rates. The basis of the income approach is the Company&#8217;s annual budget and long-range plan (&#8220;LRP&#8221;). The annual budget and LRP includes a five-year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. Because the projections are estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainty. For 2022, the estimated fair value was determined using a combined income and market approach. The market approach is based on market multiples (revenue and &#8220;EBITDA&#8221;, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data for comparable companies. The market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the \n\nCompany require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company&#8217;s facts and circumstances. \n\nThe Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the Company&#8217;s 2022 goodwill quantitative impairment review are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Discount rates: the Company used a range of 11.0% to 14.5% weighted average cost of capital (&#8220;WACC&#8221;) as the discount rates for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant. \n\n&#8226; Operating income margin: the Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated. \n\n&#8226; Revenue growth rates: the Company used a global automotive market industry growth rate forecast adjusted to estimate its own market participation for product lines. \n\nIn addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models: \n\n&#8226; The automotive industry is cyclical, and the Company&#8217;s results of operations could be adversely affected by industry downturns. \n\n&#8226; The automotive industry is evolving, and if the Company does not respond appropriately, its results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; The Company is dependent on market segments that use its key products and could be affected by decreasing demand in those segments. \n\n&#8226; The Company is subject to risks related to international operations. \n\nBased on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated the Company&#8217;s goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units was not impaired. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates from those used in acquisition-related valuations and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. Due to the Company&#8217;s recent acquisitions, there is less headroom (the difference between the carrying value and the fair value) associated with certain of the Company&#8217;s reporting units. Based on the impairment testing conducted in 2022, the amounts by which the estimated fair values of the Company&#8217;s goodwill reporting units exceeded their carrying values ranged from 25% to 153%. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s financial statements in any given year. \n\nSimilar to goodwill, the Company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trade names) using a qualitative analysis, considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion, in order to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values. If the Company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis, the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief-from-royalty method, which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief-from-royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company decided it would no longer utilize a certain trade name in the business and recognized an impairment charge of $30 million. \n\nRefer to Note 12, &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangibles,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill. \n\nProduct warranties The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Costs of product recalls, which may include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer&#8217;s cost of the recall, including labor to remove and replace the recalled part, are accrued as part of the Company&#8217;s warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Net sales $ 15,801 $ 14,838 Warranty provision $ 117 $ 225 Warranty provision as a percentage of net sales 0.7 % 1.5 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis-point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Company&#8217;s accrued warranty liability: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 25 basis point decrease (income)/expense $ (40) $ (37) 25 basis point increase (income)/expense $ 40 $ 37 ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the total accrued warranty liability was $245 million. The accrual is represented as $142 million in Other current liabilities and $103 million in Other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nRefer to Note 13, &#8220;Product Warranty,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties. \n\nPension and other postretirement defined benefits The Company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. The determination of the Company&#8217;s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in Note 18, &#8220;Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The effects of any modification to those assumptions, or actual results that differ from assumptions used, are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP. \n\nThe primary assumptions affecting the Company&#8217;s accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets : The expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. The expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Company&#8217;s trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans&#8217; invested assets. In determining its pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 2.3% to 7.2% outside of the U.S. and 4.8% in the U.S. \n\nActual returns on U.S. pension assets were (17.9)% and 3.1% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumptions of 4.8% and 5.8%, respectively, for the same years ended. \n\nActual returns on U.K. pension assets were (34.8)% and 5.4% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 4.1% and 4.0%, respectively, for the same years ended. \n\nActual returns on German pension assets were (19.7)% and 5.4% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumptions of 4.0% and 5.0%, respectively, for the same years ended. \n\n&#8226; Discount rate : The discount rate is used to calculate pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company utilizes a full-yield approach in the estimation of service and interest components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For its significant plans, the Company used discount rates ranging from 1.7% to 12.0% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022, including weighted average discount rates of 5.5% in the U.S., 4.9% outside of the U.S. (including 4.9% in the U.K.) and 5.4% for U.S. other postretirement health care plans. The U.S. and U.K. discount rates reflect the fact that the U.S. and U.K. pension plans have been closed for new participants. \n\n&#8226; Health care cost trend : For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company-specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2022, the Company used health care cost trend rates of 6.5%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 4.75% by the year 2026. \n\nWhile the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Company's pension and OPEB and its future expense. \n\nThe sensitivity to a 25 basis-point change in the assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets related to 2023 pre-tax pension expense for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is expected to be negligible. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in discount rate for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on its pension obligations: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Impact on U.S. PBO Impact on Non-U.S. PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate $ 3 $ 45 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ (3) $ (42) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe sensitivity to a 25 basis-point change in the discount rate assumption and to the assumed health care cost trend related to the Company&#8217;s OPEB obligation and service and interest cost is expected to be negligible. \n\nRefer to Note 18, &#8220;Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding the Company&#8217;s retirement benefit plans. \n\nRestructuring Restructuring costs may occur when the Company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations. A restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce, costs to terminate an operating lease or contract, professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities. \n\nThe Company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance. Costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation, the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly. When a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government, the costs are recorded upon agreement. Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period. \n\nIncome taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n\nAccounting for income taxes is complex, in part because the Company conducts business globally and, therefore, files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. Management judgment is required in determining the Company&#8217;s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and assessing the need for valuation allowances. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company&#8217;s valuation allowance may be necessary. \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. The determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Management judgment is required in determining the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. In the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax \n\ndetermination is less than certain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. The Company has certain U.S. state income tax returns and certain non-U.S. income tax returns that are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a liability for tax positions the Company estimates are not more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on the technical merits, which is included in Other non-current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. \n\nThe Company records valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of certain deferred tax assets to amounts that it expects are more-likely-than-not to be realized. Existing deferred tax assets, net operating losses and tax credits by jurisdiction and expectations of the ability to utilize these tax attributes are assessed through a review of past, current and estimated future taxable income and tax planning strategies. \n\nEstimates of future taxable income, including income generated from prudent and feasible tax planning strategies resulting from actual or planned business and operational developments, could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require the Company to consider any potential impact to the assessment of the recoverability of the related deferred tax asset. Such potential impact could be material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition or results of operations for an individual reporting period. \n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Tax Act&#8221;) that was signed into law in December 2017 constituted a major change to the U.S. tax system. The impact of the Tax Act on the Company is based on management&#8217;s current interpretations of the Tax Act, recently issued regulations and related analysis. The Company&#8217;s tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments or enacted changes to the U.S. tax law. In future periods, its effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory or legislative developments related to U.S. tax law. \n\nRefer to Note 7, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding income taxes. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nRefer to Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding new applicable accounting pronouncements. \n\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in its manufacturing operations. Some of its commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is occasionally addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. The Company does not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks. \n\nThe Company has established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. For quantitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Note 17, &#8220;Financial \n\nInstruments,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At December 31, 2022, all of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt had fixed interest rates. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \n\nForeign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, the Company&#8217;s most significant currency exposures relate to the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Korean Won, Mexican Peso, Polish Zloty, Singapore Dollar, Thailand Baht and Turkish Lira. The Company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets it serves, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of its investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. The Company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. In addition, the Company regularly enters into forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency-denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translation exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a deferred gain of $196 million and $10 million, respectively, both before taxes, for designated net investment hedges within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). \n\nThe significant foreign currency translation adjustments, including the impact of the net investment hedges discussed above, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are shown in the following table, which provides the percentage change in U.S. Dollars against the respective currencies and the approximate impacts of these changes recorded within other comprehensive income (loss) for the respective periods. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except for percentages) December 31, 2022 Chinese Renminbi (8) % $ (201) Euro (6) % $ (46) British Pound (11) % $ (40) Korean Won (6) % $ (25) India Rupee (10) % $ (11) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except for percentages) December 31, 2021 Korean Won (9) % $ (72) Euro (7) % $ (55) Brazilian Real (7) % $ (13) Japanese Yen (10) % $ (9) Chinese Renminbi 3 % $ 63 ##TABLE_END\n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nCommodity price risk is the possibility that the Company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of its products. Commodity forward and option contracts are occasionally executed to offset exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding commodity swap contracts. \n\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \n\nThe matters discussed in this Item 7 include forward looking statements. See &#8220;Forward Looking Statements&#8221; at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n"

We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nAs described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Santroll Automotive Components, Rhombus Energy Solutions, and Drivetek AG from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2022. We have also excluded Santroll Automotive Components, Rhombus Energy Solutions, and Drivetek AG from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Santroll Automotive Components, Rhombus Energy Solutions, and Drivetek AG are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total net sales excluded from management&#8217;s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent less than 1% of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nGoodwill Impairment Analysis for the Reporting Unit Containing the Goodwill from the Company&#8217;s 2021 Acquisition of Akasol AG \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s goodwill balance was $3,397 million as of December 31, 2022 and the goodwill associated with the e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment was $1,914 million. During the fourth quarter of each year, management tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a quantitative analysis. During the fourth quarter of 2022, management performed a quantitative analysis on each reporting unit to refresh its respective fair value. The estimated fair value was determined using a combined income and market approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding the revenue growth rates, operating income margin, and discount rates. The market approach is based on market multiples (revenue and &#8220;EBITDA&#8221;, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data for comparable companies. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment analysis for the reporting unit containing the goodwill from the Company&#8217;s 2021 acquisition of Akasol AG is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to the short-term revenue growth rate, long-term revenue growth rate, operating income margin, discount rate and the revenue market multiple, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s quantitative goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over the valuation of the reporting unit containing the goodwill from the Company&#8217;s 2021 acquisition of Akasol AG. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management&#8217;s process for developing the fair value estimate, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the approaches, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the short-term revenue growth rate, long-term revenue growth rate, operating income \n\nmargin, discount rate, and the revenue market multiple. Evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to the short-term revenue growth rate, and operating income margin involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company&#8217;s income and market approaches and (ii) the reasonableness of the Company&#8217;s assumptions related to the long-term revenue growth rate, discount rate, and the revenue market multiple. \n\nWorldwide Provision for Income Taxes \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded income taxes from continuing operations of $292 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management judgment is required in determining the Company&#8217;s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and assessing the need for valuation allowances. As disclosed by management, accounting for income taxes is complex, in part because the Company conducts business globally and, therefore, files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. The determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company&#8217;s global operations. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that it expects are more-likely-than-not to be realized. The Company assesses existing deferred tax assets, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards by jurisdiction and expectations of its ability to utilize these tax attributes through a review of past, current, and estimated future taxable income and tax planning strategies. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to management&#8217;s worldwide provision for income taxes is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the worldwide provision for income taxes, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s worldwide provision for income taxes, including the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s worldwide provision for income taxes, including controls over accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the accuracy of the worldwide provision for income taxes, including the rate reconciliation and permanent and temporary differences, (ii) evaluating the completeness of the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s more-likely-than-not determination in consideration of the tax laws in relevant jurisdictions, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on expectations of the ability to utilize its tax attributes through a review of historical and estimated future taxable income and tax planning strategies.

(together with its Consolidated Subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1987. The Company is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. The Company&#8217;s products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. The Company manufactures and sells these products worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles (&#8220;SUVs&#8221;), vans and light trucks). The Company's products are also sold to OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). The Company also manufactures and sells its products to certain tier one vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in Europe, the Americas and Asia and is an original equipment supplier to nearly every major automotive OEM in the world. \n\nOn December 6, 2022, the Company announced its intention to execute a tax-free spin-off of the Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments into a separate, publicly traded company. The intended separation of its Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments would support optimizing the Company&#8217;s combustion portfolio and advancing its electrification journey, while at the same time creating a new, focused company that would be able to pursue growth opportunities in alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, and in Aftermarket. The Company expects to complete the transaction in late 2023, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions. \n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic and Other Supply Disruptions \n\nThroughout 2020, COVID-19 materially impacted the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. During the first quarter of 2020, the impact of COVID-19 was initially experienced primarily by operations in China. Following the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, government authorities around the world began to impose shelter-in-place orders and other restrictions. As a result, many OEMs began suspending manufacturing operations, particularly in North America and Europe. This led to various temporary closures of, or reduced operations at, the Company&#8217;s manufacturing facilities, late in the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter of 2020. During the second half of 2020, as global management of COVID-19 evolved and government restrictions were removed or lessened, production levels improved, and substantially all of the Company&#8217;s production facilities resumed closer to normal operations by the end of the third quarter of 2020. In 2022, COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions caused intermittent disruptions in the Company&#8217;s supply chain and local manufacturing operations. For a significant portion of the second quarter of 2022, China imposed lockdowns in many cities due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in the region, which contributed to a decline in industry production in China during the quarter. \n\nDuring 2021, and to a lesser extent in 2022, trailing impacts of the shutdowns and production declines related, in part, to COVID-19 created supply constraints of certain components, particularly semiconductor chips. These supply constraints have had, and are expected to continue to have, significant impacts on global industry production levels. In addition, it is possible a resurgence of COVID-19 could result in adverse impacts in the future. Management cannot reasonably estimate the full impact the ongoing supply constraints or the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe following paragraphs briefly describe the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies. \n\nBasis of presentation Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of acquisitions following the date of the respective acquisition. Refer to Note 2, &#8220;Acquisitions and Dispositions,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nUse of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes, as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nPrinciples of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries with a controlling financial interest. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \n\nJoint ventures and equity securities The Company has investments in three unconsolidated joint ventures: NSK-Warner K.K., Turbo Energy Private Limited and Delphi-TVS Diesel Systems Ltd of which the Company owns 50 %, 32.6 % and 52.5 %, respectively. These joint ventures are non-controlled affiliates in which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest and, therefore, are accounted for under the equity method. With respect to the Company&#8217;s 52.5 %-owned joint venture, although the Company is the majority owner, it does not have the ability to control significant decisions or management of the entity. Generally, under the equity method, the Company&#8217;s original investments in these joint ventures are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted by the Company&#8217;s share of equity in income or losses. The Company monitors its equity method investments for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in fair value on an ongoing basis. If such a decline has occurred, an impairment charge is recorded, which is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. The Company&#8217;s investment in these non-controlled affiliates is included within Investments and long-term receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company&#8217;s share of equity in income or losses is included in Equity in affiliates&#8217; earnings, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nThe Company also has certain investments for which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence (generally when ownership interest is less than 20%). The Company&#8217;s investment in these equity securities is included within Investments and long-term receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 10, &#8220;Other Current and Non-Current Assets,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nInterests in privately held companies that do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for using the measurement alternative under ASC Topic 321, &#8220;Investments - Equity Securities,&#8221; which includes monitoring on an ongoing basis for indicators of impairments or upward adjustments. These equity securities are measured at cost less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. If the Company determines that an indicator of impairment or upward adjustment is present, an adjustment is recorded, which is measured as the difference between carrying value and estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is generally determined using an income approach on discounted cash flows or negotiated transaction values. \n\nEquity securities that have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value and which provide a net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) or its \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nequivalent, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. Changes in fair value and NAV are recorded in Unrealized loss (gain) on debt and equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nDebt securities On November 16, 2022, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Wolfspeed, Inc. (&#8220;Wolfspeed&#8221;) as part of which the Company invested $ 500 million in convertible debt securities of Wolfspeed. The Company elected to classify the debt security as trading and will remeasure quarterly using fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 320, &#8220;Investments.&#8221; Refer to Note 16, &#8220;Fair Value Measurements,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the fair value of the convertible debt securities. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investment in the debt securities is included within Investments and long-term receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The changes in fair value are recorded in Unrealized loss (gain) on debt and equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nBusiness combinations In accordance with ASC Topic 805, &#8220;Business Combinations,&#8221; acquisitions are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company includes the operating results of acquired entities from their respective dates of acquisition. The Company recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest at the acquisition date fair value. Various valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of intangible assets, with the primary techniques being forms of the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation methods. Under these valuation approaches, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions from a market participant perspective that may include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, royalty rates, obsolescence factors, contributory asset charges, customer attrition and discount rates. The excess, if any, of total consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest is recognized as goodwill. Costs incurred as a result of a business combination other than costs related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recorded in the period the costs are incurred. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. \n\nRevenue recognition Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of control of the products. For most products, transfer of control occurs upon shipment or delivery; however, a limited number of customer arrangements for highly customized products with no alternative use provide the Company with the right to payment during the production process. As a result, for these limited arrangements, revenue is recognized as goods are produced and control transfers to the customer using the input cost-to-cost method. Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the goods. Although the Company may enter into long-term supply arrangements with its major customers, the prices and volumes are not fixed over the life of the arrangements, and a contract does not exist for purposes of applying ASC Topic 606, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers,&#8221; until volumes are contractually known. \n\nSales incentives and allowances (including returns) are recognized as a reduction to revenue at the time of the related sale. The Company estimates the allowances based on an analysis of historical experience. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority collected by the Company concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction are excluded from net sales. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in sales, while costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of sales. The Company has elected to apply the accounting policy election available under ASC Topic 606 and accounts for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost. \n\nThe Company has a limited number of arrangements with customers where the price paid by the customer is dependent on the volume of product purchased over the term of the arrangement. In other arrangements, the Company will provide a rebate to customers based on the volume of products \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\npurchased during the course of the arrangement. The Company estimates the volumes to be sold over the term of the arrangement and recognizes revenue based on the estimated amount of consideration to be received from these arrangements. \n\nThe Company continually seeks business development opportunities and at times provides customer incentives for new program awards. The Company evaluates the underlying economics of each amount of consideration payable to a customer to determine the proper accounting by understanding the reasons for the payment, the rights and obligations resulting from the payment, the nature of the promise in the contract, and other relevant facts and circumstances. When the Company determines that the payments are incremental and incurred only if the new business is obtained and expects to recover these amounts from the customer over the term of the new business arrangement, the Company capitalizes these amounts. The Company recognizes a reduction to revenue as products that the upfront payments are related to are transferred to the customer, based on the total amount of products expected to be sold over the term of the arrangement (generally three to seven years ). The Company evaluates the amounts capitalized each period end for recoverability and expenses any amounts that are no longer expected to be recovered over the term of the business arrangement. \n\nRefer to Note 3, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nCost of sales The Company includes materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales. Manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials, indirect labor, factory operating costs, warranty costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale. \n\nCash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are valued at fair market value. It is the Company's policy to classify all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal risk. \n\nRestricted cash Restricted cash includes amounts designated for uses other than current operations and is related to the Company&#8217;s commitment to acquire or invest in certain companies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had restricted cash of $ 5 million and $ 3 million, respectively. \n\nReceivables, net and long-term receivables Accounts receivable and long-term receivables are stated at cost less an allowance for credit losses. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate based on expected losses, current economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer&#8217;s accounts receivable. \n\nSales of receivables are accounted for in accordance with the ASC Topic 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing.&#8221; Agreements which result in true sales of the transferred receivables, as defined in ASC Topic 860, which occur when receivables are transferred to a third party without recourse to the Company, are excluded from amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash proceeds received from such sales are included in operating cash flows. The expenses associated with receivables factoring are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within interest expense. Refer to Note 8, &#8220;Receivables, Net,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nInventories, net The majority of inventory is measured using first-in, first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) or average-cost methods at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with the exception of certain U.S. inventories that are determined using the last-in, first-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;) method at the lower of cost or market. Inventory held by U.S. operations using the LIFO method was $ 184 million and $ 178 million at December 31, 2022 and \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\n2021, respectively. Such inventories, if valued at current cost instead of LIFO, would have been greater by $ 25 million as of each of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 9, &#8220;Inventories, net,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nPre-production costs related to long-term supply arrangements Engineering, research and development and other design and development costs for products sold on long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred unless the Company has a contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the customer. Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the Company has title to the assets are capitalized in property, plant and equipment and amortized to cost of sales over the shorter of the term of the arrangement or over the estimated useful lives of the assets, typically three to five years . Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the Company has a contractual guarantee for lump sum reimbursement from the customer are capitalized in prepayments and other current assets. \n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net Property, plant and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals of relatively minor items are generally charged to expense as incurred. Renewals of significant items are capitalized. Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for buildings range from 15 to 40 years, and useful lives for machinery and equipment range from three to 12 years. For income tax purposes, accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used. Refer to Note 11, &#8220;Property, Plant and Equipment, Net,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nImpairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under ASC Topic 360, &#8220;Property, Plant and Equipment.&#8221; In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820, &#8220;Fair Value Measurement,&#8221; using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. \n\nManagement believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a quantitative analysis. The qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. Using this qualitative assessment, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition, restructuring or disposal activity or to refresh the fair values, the Company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, the Company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. \n\nThe Company has definite-lived intangible assets related to patents and developed technology, customer relationships and trade names. The Company amortizes definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. The Company also has intangible assets related to acquired trade names that are classified as indefinite-lived when there are no foreseeable limits on the periods of time over which they are expected to contribute cash flows. Costs to renew or extend the term of acquired intangible assets are recognized as expense as incurred. \n\nSimilar to goodwill, the Company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trade names) using a qualitative analysis, considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion, in order to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values. If the Company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis, the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief-from-royalty method, which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief-from-royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use. \n\nRefer to Note 12, &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangibles,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale The Company classifies assets and liabilities (disposal groups) to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond the Company&#8217;s control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. \n\nThe Company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nsale. Additionally, depreciation is not recorded during the period in which the long-lived assets, included in the disposal group, are classified as held for sale. \n\nUpon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nProduct warranties The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years . Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Costs of product recalls, which may include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer&#8217;s cost of the recall, including labor to remove and replace the recalled part, are accrued as part of the Company&#8217;s warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. The product warranty accrual is allocated to current and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nRefer to Note 13, &#8220;Product Warranty,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nOther loss accruals and valuation allowances The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers&#8217; compensation claims, litigation and recoverability of certain assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances. \n\nEnvironmental contingencies The Company accounts for environmental costs in accordance with ASC Topic 450, &#8220;Contingencies.&#8221; Costs related to environmental assessments and remediation efforts at operating facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs are recorded at undiscounted amounts, based on experience and assessments and are regularly evaluated. The liabilities are recorded in Other current and Other non-current liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nRefer to Note 21, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nGovernment grants The Company periodically receives government grants representing assistance provided by a government. These government grants are generally received in cash and typically provide reimbursement related to acquisition of property and equipment, product development or local governmental economic relief. The government grants are generally amortized using a systematic and rational method over the life of the grant. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded government grant related liabilities of $ 3 million in Other current liabilities and $ 53 million in Other non-current liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 52 million and $ 9 million of government grant-related credits in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Cost of sales, respectively, in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nDerivative financial instruments The Company recognizes that certain normal business transactions and foreign currency operations generate risk. Examples of risks include exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, changes in commodity costs and interest rates. It is the objective of the Company to assess the impact of these transaction risks and offer protection from selected risks through various methods, including financial \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nderivatives. Virtually all derivative instruments held by the Company are designated as hedges, have high correlation with the underlying exposure and are highly effective in offsetting underlying price movements. Accordingly, gains and losses from changes in qualifying hedge fair values are matched with the underlying transactions. Hedge instruments are generally reported gross, with no right to offset, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value based on quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. The Company does not engage in any derivative transactions for purposes other than hedging specific operational risks. \n\nRefer to Note 17, &#8220;Financial Instruments,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nForeign currency The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. Dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses and capital expenditures. The local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Translation adjustments for foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in equity. The Company recognizes transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in earnings as incurred. \n\nRefer to Note 20, &#8220;Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nPensions and other postretirement employee defined benefits The Company&#8217;s defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715, &#8220;Compensation - Retirement Benefits.&#8221; Disability, early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 712, &#8220;Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits.&#8221; \n\nPensions and other postretirement employee benefit costs and related liabilities and assets are dependent upon assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, health care cost trends, compensation and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and accordingly, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. \n\nRefer to Note 18, &#8220;Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nRestructuring Restructuring costs may occur when the Company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations. A restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce, costs to terminate an operating lease or contract, professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities. \n\nThe Company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance. Costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation, the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly. When a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government, the costs are recorded upon agreement. Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period. \n\nRefer to Note 4, &#8220;Restructuring,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nIncome taxes In accordance with ASC Topic 740, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; the Company&#8217;s income tax expense is calculated based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and requires the use of management&#8217;s estimates and judgments. Accounting for income taxes is complex, in part because the Company conducts business globally and, therefore, files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. Management judgment is required in determining the Company&#8217;s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and assessing the need for valuation allowances. \n\nThe determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company&#8217;s global operations. Management judgment is required in determining the gross unrecognized tax benefits&#8217; related liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. \n\nThe Company records valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that it expects are more-likely-than-not to be realized. The Company assesses existing deferred tax assets, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards by jurisdiction and expectations of its ability to utilize these tax attributes through a review of past, current and estimated future taxable income and tax planning strategies. \n\nRefer to Note 7, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\n&#160; \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, &#8220;Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.&#8221; It is expected to increase transparency in financial reporting by requiring business entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance they receive. The amendments require the following annual disclosures about transactions with a government: (i) information about the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions; (ii) the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected by the transactions, and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item; and (iii) significant terms and conditions of the transactions, including commitments and contingencies. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively as of January 1, 2022, and there was no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the Company has included the required disclosures. Refer to Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements above for more detail. \n\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, &#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.&#8221; It requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. The amendments improve comparability after the business combination by providing consistent recognition and measurement guidance for revenue contracts with customers acquired in a business combination and revenue contracts with customers not acquired in a business combination. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNOTE 2 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS \n\nAcquisitions \n\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 805, &#8220;Business Combinations,&#8221; acquisitions are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company recognizes and measures the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest using a range of methodologies as indicated by generally accepted valuation practices. Various valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of intangible assets, with the primary techniques being forms of the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation methods. Under these valuation approaches, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions from a market participant perspective and may include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, royalty rates, obsolescence factors, contributory asset charges, customer attrition and discount rates. For each acquisition disclosed below, management used a third-party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the provisional purchase accounting fair values; however, management ultimately oversees the third-party valuation firm to ensure that the transaction-specific assumptions are appropriate for the Company. \n\nDue to the insignificant size of the 2022 and 2021 acquisitions, both individually and in the aggregate, relative to the Company, supplemental pro forma financial information for the current and prior reporting periods is not provided. \n\nHubei Surpass Sun Electric Charging Business \n\nOn September 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement under which BorgWarner will acquire the electric vehicle solution, smart grid and smart energy businesses of Hubei Surpass Sun Electric. The transaction has an enterprise value up to &#165; 410 million ($ 60 million), of which approximately &#165; 267 million ($ 39 million) will be delivered at or soon after closing, and up to &#165; 143 million ($ 21 million) could be paid in the form of contingent payments over approximately two years following the closing. The acquisition complements the Company&#8217;s existing European and North American charging footprint by adding a presence in China. The transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nDrivetek AG \n\nOn December 1, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of 100 % of Drivetek AG (&#8220;Drivetek&#8221;), an engineering and product development company located in Switzerland. This acquisition strengthens the Company&#8217;s power electronics capabilities in auxiliary inverters, which it expects to accelerate the growth of the High Voltage eFan business. The Company paid &#8355; 27 million ($ 29 million) at closing, and up to &#8355; 10 million ($ 10 million) could be paid in the form of contingent earn-out payments over the three years following closing. The earn-out payments are contingent upon achievement of estimated future sales targets associated with newly awarded business and future turnover rate targets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s estimate of the earn-out payments was approximately $ 10 million, which is recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nThe purchase price was allocated on a provisional basis as of December 1, 2022. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values based on management&#8217;s estimates, available information, and supportable assumptions that management considered reasonable. Certain estimated values for the acquisition, including goodwill, tangible and intangible assets and deferred taxes, are not yet finalized, and the provisional purchase price allocations are subject to change as the Company completes its analysis of the fair value at the date of acquisition. The final valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be materially different from the estimated values shown below. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 1, 2022 were assets of $ 49 million, including goodwill and intangibles of $ 40 million, and liabilities of $ 10 million. \n\nAny excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets was recognized as goodwill. Goodwill of $ 22 million was recorded within the Company&#8217;s Air Management segment. The goodwill consists of the Company&#8217;s expected future economic benefits that will be realized from expanding the Company&#8217;s electric vehicle portfolio as electric vehicle production continues to increase. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. \n\nIn connection with the acquisition, the Company preliminarily recorded $ 18 million for intangible assets, primarily for developed technology and customer relationships. As described above, the provisional fair value of intangible assets was valued using the income approach. \n\nThe impact of the Drivetek acquisition on net sales and net earnings was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nRhombus Energy Solutions \n\nOn July 29, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of 100 % of Rhombus Energy Solutions (&#8220;Rhombus&#8221;), a provider of charging solutions in the North American market, pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;). The acquisition complements the Company&#8217;s existing European charging footprint to accelerate organic growth and adds North American regional presence to its charging business. \n\nThe Company paid $ 131 million at closing. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is obligated to remit up to $ 30 million of earn-out payments, payable in 2025, contingent upon achievement of certain sales dollars, sales volume, and gross margin targets. The Company&#8217;s current estimates indicate that the minimum thresholds for these earn-out targets will not be achieved, thus no amount for the earn-out payments has been included in the purchase consideration or in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is obligated to remit up to $ 25 million over the three years following closing in key employee retention related payments, which include certain performance targets. The amounts will be accounted for as post-combination expense. \n\nThe purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis as of July 29, 2022. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values based on management&#8217;s estimates, available information, and supportable assumptions that management considered reasonable. Certain estimated values for the acquisition, including goodwill and deferred taxes, are not yet finalized, and the preliminary purchase price allocations are subject to change as the Company completes its analysis of the fair value at the date of acquisition. The final valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be materially different from the estimated values shown below. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of July 29, 2022, the acquisition date: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Initial Allocation Measurement Period Adjustments Revised Allocation ASSETS Current assets $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7 &#160; Goodwill 104 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 104 &#160; Other intangible assets, net 27 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 27 &#160; Other non-current assets 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Total assets acquired 142 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 142 &#160; LIABILITIES Current liabilities 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; Other non-current liabilities 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 11 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11 &#160; Net assets acquired $ 131 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 131 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAny excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets was recognized as goodwill. Goodwill of $ 104 million was recorded within the Company&#8217;s Air Management segment. The goodwill consists of the Company&#8217;s expected future economic benefits that will be realized from expanding the Company&#8217;s electric vehicle portfolio as electric vehicle production continues to increase. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. \n\nThe following table summarizes the other intangible assets acquired: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Estimated Life Estimated Fair Value Developed technology 13 years $ 22 &#160; Customer relationships 8 years 5 &#160; Total other intangible assets $ 27 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill and identifiable intangible assets were valued using the income approach. \n\nThe impact of the Rhombus acquisition on net sales and net earnings was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nSantroll Automotive Components \n\nOn March 31, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of 100 % of Santroll Automotive Components (&#8220;Santroll&#8221;), a carve-out of Santroll Electric Auto&#8217;s eMotor business, pursuant to the terms of an Equity Transfer Agreement (&#8220;ETA&#8221;). The acquisition strengthens the Company&#8217;s vertical integration, scale and portfolio breadth in light vehicle eMotors while allowing for increased speed to market. \n\nThe total final consideration was $ 192 million, which reflects a reduction of approximately $ 20 million in the base purchase price since the acquisition closing date resulting from an amendment to the ETA and finalization of post-closing adjustments. The consideration includes approximately &#165; 1.0 billion ($ 152 million) of base purchase price and &#165; 0.25 billion ($ 40 million) of originally estimated earn-out payments. The Company paid approximately $ 157 million of base purchase price in the year ended December 31, 2022 and expects to recapture approximately $ 5 million of post-closing adjustments through a reduction of the payment of the second earn-out. Pursuant to the ETA, the obligation of the Company to remit up to &#165; 0.3 billion (approximately $ 47 million) of earn-out payments is contingent upon achievement of certain sales volume targets and certain estimated future volume targets associated with newly awarded business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s estimate of the earn-out payments was approximately $ 21 million. The net amount of the earn-out payment and post-closing adjustments is recorded in Other current liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis as of March 31, 2022. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values based on management&#8217;s estimates, available information, and supportable assumptions that management considered reasonable. Certain estimated values for the acquisition, including goodwill and deferred taxes, are not yet finalized, and the preliminary purchase price allocations are subject to change as the Company completes its analysis of the fair value at the date of acquisition. The final valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be materially different from the estimated values shown below. \n\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of March 31, 2022, the acquisition date: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Initial Allocation Measurement Period Adjustments Revised Allocation ASSETS Current assets $ 8 &#160; $ ( 2 ) $ 6 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net 9 &#160; 2 &#160; 11 &#160; Goodwill 132 &#160; ( 20 ) 112 &#160; Other intangible assets, net 87 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 87 &#160; Total assets acquired 236 &#160; ( 20 ) 216 &#160; LIABILITIES Current liabilities 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; Other non-current liabilities 22 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 22 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 24 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 24 &#160; Net assets acquired $ 212 &#160; $ ( 20 ) $ 192 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAny excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets was recognized as goodwill. Goodwill of $ 112 million was recorded within the Company&#8217;s e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment. The goodwill consists of the Company&#8217;s expected future economic benefits that will arise from future product sales and the added capabilities from vertical integration of eMotors. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes in China. \n\nThe following table summarizes the other intangible assets acquired: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Estimated Life Estimated Fair Value Customer relationships 12 years $ 62 &#160; Manufacturing processes (know-how) 10 years 25 &#160; Total other intangible assets $ 87 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill and identifiable intangible assets were valued using the income approach. \n\nThe impact of the Santroll acquisition on net sales and net earnings was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nAKASOL AG \n\nOn June 4, 2021, the Company completed its voluntary public takeover offer for shares of AKASOL AG (&#8220;AKASOL&#8221;), resulting in ownership of 89 % of AKASOL&#8217;s outstanding shares. The Company paid approximately &#8364; 648 million ($ 788 million) to settle the offer from current cash balances, which included proceeds received from its public offering of 1.00 % Senior Notes due 2031 completed on May 19, 2021. Refer to Note 14, &#8220;Notes Payable and Debt,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Following the settlement of the offer, AKASOL became a consolidated majority-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company also consolidated approximately &#8364; 64 million ($ 77 million) of gross debt of AKASOL. Subsequent to the completion of the voluntary public takeover offer, the Company purchased additional shares of AKASOL for &#8364; 28 million ($ 33 million) increasing its ownership to 93 % as of December 31, 2021. \n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company initiated a merger squeeze-out process under German law for the purpose of acquiring 100 % of AKASOL. On December 17, 2021, the shareholders of AKASOL voted to mandatorily transfer to ABBA BidCo. AG, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, each issued and outstanding share of AKASOL held by shareholders that did not tender their shares in the Company&#8217;s previously completed exchange offer for AKASOL shares (the &#8220;Squeeze Out&#8221;). In exchange for the AKASOL shares transferred in the Squeeze Out, the Company paid appropriate cash compensation, in the amount of &#8364; 119.16 per share, which was determined after an assessment by a third-party valuation firm, the adequacy of which was examined by an independent, court-appointed auditor. At December 31, 2021, the noncontrolling interest in AKASOL of approximately &#8364; 51 million ($ 58 million) to be acquired through the Squeeze Out was reclassified to Other current liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as it was deemed mandatorily redeemable. No shareholder objections were filed during the statutory contestation period, and on February 10, 2022, the Company completed the registration of the Squeeze Out resulting in 100 % ownership. The Company settled the Squeeze Out with AKASOL minority shareholders in the first quarter of 2022. \n\nThe acquisition further strengthens BorgWarner&#8217;s commercial vehicle and industrial electrification capabilities, which positions the Company to capitalize on what it believes to be a fast-growing battery module and pack market. Following the June 4, 2021 acquisition date, AKASOL&#8217;s operations had net sales of $ 67 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The impact on net earnings was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2021.The Company finalized its valuation of the assets and liabilities of the AKASOL acquisition during the second quarter of 2022. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and subsequent measurement period adjustments: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Initial Allocation Measurement Period Adjustments Final Allocation ASSETS \n\nCash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash of $ 16 million) \n\n$ 29 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 29 &#160; Receivables, net 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 16 &#160; Inventories, net 42 &#160; ( 2 ) 40 &#160; Prepayments and other current assets 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net 106 &#160; ( 3 ) 103 &#160; Goodwill 707 &#160; ( 3 ) 704 &#160; Other intangible assets, net 130 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 130 &#160; Other non-current assets &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; 7 &#160; Total assets acquired 1,035 &#160; ( 1 ) 1,034 &#160; LIABILITIES Notes payable and other short-term debt 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; Accounts payable 22 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 22 &#160; Other current liabilities 13 &#160; 6 &#160; 19 &#160; Long-term debt 69 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 69 &#160; Other non-current liabilities 39 &#160; ( 7 ) 32 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 151 &#160; ( 1 ) 150 &#160; Noncontrolling interests 96 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 96 &#160; Net assets and noncontrolling interest acquired $ 788 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 788 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAny excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets was recognized as goodwill. Goodwill of $ 704 million, including the impact of measurement period adjustments, was initially recorded within the Company&#8217;s Air Management segment. In 2022, the goodwill was moved to the e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment following the inter-segment transition of this business. Both before and after this transition, this business was evaluated for impairment as a standalone goodwill reporting unit. The goodwill consists of the Company&#8217;s expected future economic benefits that will arise from acquiring this business, which is established in making next-generation products for electric vehicles and the potential development and deployment of future technologies, across a global customer base, in this market and across adjacent industries. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. \n\nThe following table summarizes the other intangible assets acquired: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Estimated Life Estimated Fair Value Amortized intangible assets: Developed technology 5 years $ 70 &#160; Customer relationships 11 years 25 &#160; Total amortized intangible assets 95 &#160; Unamortized trade names Indefinite 35 &#160; Total other intangible assets $ 130 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe property, plant and equipment acquired were valued using a combination of cost and market approaches.

Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company issued, in exchange for each Delphi Technologies share, 0.4307 of a share of common stock of the Company, par value $ 0.01 per share and cash in lieu of any fractional share. In the aggregate, the Company delivered consideration of approximately $ 2.4 billion. The acquisition has strengthened the Company&#8217;s electronics and power electronics products, strengthened its capabilities and scale, enhanced key combustion, commercial vehicle and aftermarket product offerings, and positioned the Company for greater growth as electrified propulsion systems gain momentum. Upon closing, the Company also assumed approximately $ 800 million (par value) in aggregate principal amount of Delphi Technologies&#8217; outstanding 5.0 % Senior Notes due October 2025. \n\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price for Delphi Technologies: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except for share data) BorgWarner common stock issued for purchase of Delphi Technologies 37,188,819 BorgWarner share price at October 1, 2020 $ 39.54 &#160; Fair value of stock consideration $ 1,470 &#160; Stock compensation consideration 7 Total stock consideration $ 1,477 &#160; Cash consideration 18 &#160; Repayment of Delphi Technologies&#8217; debt 896 &#160; Total consideration $ 2,391 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred $ 27 million of expense related to the amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment. \n\nThe following table summarizes the net sales and earnings related to Delphi Technologies&#8217; operations that have been included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, following the October 1, 2020 acquisition date: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Net sales $ 1,120 &#160; Net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ 30 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPro forma financial information (unaudited): The following table summarizes, on a pro forma basis, the combined results of operations of the Company and Delphi Technologies business as though the acquisition and the related financing had occurred as of January 1, 2019.

Actual operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been included in the table below for comparative purposes. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\n##TABLE_START Actual Pro forma (unaudited) Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales $ 15,801 &#160; $ 14,838 &#160; $ 12,792 &#160; Net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ 944 &#160; $ 537 &#160; $ 616 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThese pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying the Company&#8217;s accounting policies and the results presented above primarily reflect (i) depreciation adjustments relating to fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment; (ii) amortization adjustments relating to fair value estimates of intangible assets; (iii) incremental interest expense, net on debt related transactions; (iv) cost of goods sold adjustments relating to fair value adjustments to inventory; and (v) stock-based compensation that was accelerated and settled on the date of acquisition. \n\nIn 2020, the Company incurred $ 89 million of acquisition-related costs. These expenses are included in Other operating expense, net in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\nRomeo Power, Inc. \n\nIn May 2019, the Company invested $ 50 million in exchange for a 20 % equity interest in Romeo Systems, Inc., now known as Romeo Power, Inc., (&#8220;Romeo&#8221;), a technology-leading battery module and pack supplier that was then privately held. On December 29, 2020, through the business combination of Romeo Systems, Inc. and special purpose acquisition company RMG Acquisition Corporation, a new entity, Romeo Power, Inc., became a publicly listed company. The Company&#8217;s ownership in Romeo was reduced to 14 %, and the investment was recorded at fair value on an ongoing basis with changes in fair value being recognized in Unrealized loss (gain) on debt and equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a loss of $ 362 million and a gain of $ 382 million, respectively, to adjust the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s investment to fair value. As of December 31, 2021, the investment&#8217;s fair value was $ 70 million, which was reflected in Investments and long-term receivables in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss of $ 39 million and liquidated its investment in Romeo shares at a fair value of $ 31 million. As of March 17, 2022, the Company no longer held any investment in Romeo. \n\nIn September 2019, the Company and Romeo contributed total equity of $ 10 million and formed a new joint venture, BorgWarner Romeo Power LLC (&#8220;Romeo JV&#8221;), in which the Company owned a 60 % interest. Romeo JV was a variable interest entity focusing on producing battery module and pack technology. The Company was the primary beneficiary of Romeo JV and had consolidated Romeo JV in its consolidated financial statements. On October 25, 2021, the Company delivered written notice to Romeo that the Company was electing to exercise its right to put its ownership stake in Romeo JV to Romeo. Based on an independent appraisal, the Company&#8217;s interest in Romeo JV was valued at $ 30 million. As the estimated fair value, less costs to sell, of the Company&#8217;s investment exceeded its carrying value, no adjustment to the carrying value was required at December 31, 2021. In February 2022, the Company completed the sale of its 60 % interest in the Romeo JV for $ 29 million, the fair value of $ 30 million reduced by a 5 % discount pursuant to the joint venture agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $ 22 million in Other operating expense, net, which represented the difference between the Company&#8217;s book value of its interest in Romeo JV compared to the fair value of consideration received. As a result of the sale, the Company has no further rights in or involvement with Romeo JV. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nWater Valley Divestiture \n\nIn 2021, the Company announced its strategy to aggressively grow its electrification product portfolio over time through organic investments and technology-focused acquisitions. Additionally, the Company announced a plan to dispose of certain internal combustion assets in support of that strategy. In December 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Water Valley, Mississippi manufacturing facility (&#8220;Water Valley&#8221;) and the associated solenoid, transmission control module and stop/start accumulator system business for an estimated $ 57 million. The consideration consisted of $ 39 million in cash and notes and up to $ 30 million in potential earn-out payments. The Company included $ 18 million as contingent consideration in the proceeds, which reflected its original estimate of the payout pursuant to the earn-out. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company changed its estimate of the expected earn-out and recorded a pre-tax loss of $ 9 million in Other operating expense, net. The contingent consideration and promissory note were included in Receivables, net and Investments and long-term receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nWater Valley had net sales of $ 177 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and was included in the Company&#8217;s e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment. On December 31, 2021, upon the closing of the transaction, based upon the final transaction price agreed to in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a loss on divestiture of $ 22 million. As a result of this transaction, assets of $ 99 million, including allocated goodwill of $ 12 million, and liabilities of $ 20 million were removed from the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021. \n\nNOTE 3 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS \n\nThe Company manufactures and sells products, primarily to OEMs of light vehicles and, to a lesser extent, to other OEMs of commercial vehicles and off-highway vehicles, to certain tier one vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket. The Company&#8217;s payment terms are based on customary business practices and vary by customer type and products offered. The Company has evaluated the terms of its arrangements and determined that they do not contain significant financing components. \n\nGenerally, revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery; however, a limited number of the Company&#8217;s customer arrangements for its highly customized products with no alternative use provide the Company with the right to payment during the production process. As a result, for these limited arrangements, revenue is recognized as goods are produced and control transfers to the customer using the input cost-to-cost method. The Company recorded a contract asset of $ 16 million and $ 17 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for these arrangements. These amounts are reflected in Prepayments and other current assets in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nIn limited instances, certain customers have provided payments in advance of receiving related products, typically at the onset of an arrangement prior to the beginning of production. These contract liabilities are reflected as Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $ 16 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 21 million at December 31, 2021, respectively. These amounts are reflected as revenue over the term of the arrangement (typically three to seven years ) as the underlying products are shipped and represent the Company&#8217;s remaining performance obligations as of the end of the period. \n\nThe Company continually seeks business development opportunities and at times provides customer incentives for new program awards. When the Company determines that the payments are incremental and incurred only if the new business is obtained and expects to recover these amounts from the customer over the term of the new business arrangement, the Company capitalizes these amounts. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded customer incentive payments of $ 34 million and $ 36 million, respectively, in Prepayments and other current assets, and $ 99 million and $ 137 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe following table represents a disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers by reporting segment and region for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The balances for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have been recast for inter-segment transitions of certain businesses that were completed during 2022.

HNTE status is granted for three-year periods, and the Company seeks to renew such status on a regular basis. In addition, beneficial impacts were recognized related to tax deductions for qualifying research and development expenditures ($ 42 million, $ 27 million and $ 9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively). \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate is also impacted by net changes to valuation allowances, where the Company has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,the Company recorded net expense related to valuation allowances of $ 67 million, $ 39 million and $ 53 million, respectively. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits of $ 33 million, primarily related to a reduction in certain unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest related to a matter for which the statute of limitations had lapsed and favorable provision-to-return adjustments. \n\nIn 2021, the Company recognized a $ 55 million tax benefit related to a reduction in certain unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest related to a matter for which the statute of limitations had lapsed. In addition, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $ 20 million related to an increase in its deferred tax assets as a result of an increase in the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) tax rate from 19% to 25%. This rate change was enacted in June 2021 and becomes effective April 2023. Further, a net discrete tax benefit of $ 36 million was recognized, primarily related to changes to certain withholding rates applied to unremitted earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company received approval for tax holiday status reducing the statutory tax rate for two of its legal entities, resulting in a reduction in tax expense of $ 28 million in 2021. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nIn 2020, the Company recognized $ 49 million of income tax expense, which primarily related to final U.S. Department of Treasury regulations issued in the third quarter of 2020, which impacted the net tax on remittance of foreign earnings, and certain tax law changes in India effective in the first quarter of 2020. \n\nA roll forward of the Company&#8217;s total gross unrecognized tax benefits is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance, January 1 $ 221 &#160; $ 231 &#160; $ 146 &#160; Additions based on tax positions related to current year 20 &#160; 23 &#160; 14 &#160; Acquisitions &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; 54 &#160; (Reductions) additions for tax positions of prior years ( 8 ) &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; Reductions for lapse in statute of limitations ( 14 ) ( 36 ) ( 5 ) Reductions for closure of tax audits and settlements ( 21 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Translation adjustment ( 14 ) ( 5 ) 13 &#160; Balance, December 31 $ 184 &#160; $ 221 &#160; $ 231 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense and accrued approximately $ 57 million and $ 51 million for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized expense related to interest and penalties of $ 5 million, $ 16 million and $ 21 million, respectively. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company also recorded a reduction in tax expense of $ 34 million for previously recorded interest related to matters for which the statute of limitations lapsed. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 218 million represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount includes a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes that would occur upon recognition of the state tax benefits and U.S. foreign tax credits included therein. \n\nThe Company estimates that it is reasonably possible there could be a decrease of approximately $ 26 million in unrecognized tax benefits and interest in the next 12 months related to the closure of an audit and the lapse in statute of limitations subsequent to the reporting period from certain taxing jurisdictions. \n\nThe Company and/or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. In certain tax jurisdictions, the Company may have more than one taxpayer.

The Company has a valuation allowance recorded of $ 449 million with regards to these deferred tax assets. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, certain U.S. subsidiaries had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $ 23 million for federal and state NOL carryforwards, $ 21 million of which expire at various dates from 2023 through 2041 and $ 2 million of which have an indefinite life. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $ 17 million with regards to these deferred tax assets. In addition, certain U.S. subsidiaries also have state tax credit carryforwards of $ 29 million, which are offset by a valuation allowance of $ 29 million. \n\nThe Company reviews the likelihood that the benefit of its deferred tax assets will be realized and, therefore, the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis. The Company assesses existing deferred tax assets, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards by jurisdiction and expectations of its ability to utilize these tax attributes through a review of past, current, and estimated future taxable income and tax planning strategies. If, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Due to recent restructurings, the Company concluded that the weight of the negative evidence outweighs the \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\npositive evidence in certain foreign jurisdictions. As a result, the Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions that include entities in Luxembourg, Hungary, France, Spain, Ireland and the U.K. will not be realized in the future. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded deferred tax liabilities of $ 141 million with respect to foreign unremitted earnings. The Company did not provide deferred tax liabilities with respect to certain book versus tax basis differences not represented by undistributed earnings of approximately $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022, because the Company continues to assert indefinite reinvestment of these basis differences. These basis differences would become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of the foreign subsidiaries. The Company&#8217;s best estimate of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these basis differences is approximately $ 70 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\nNOTE 8 RECEIVABLES, NET \n\nThe table below provides details of receivables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Receivables, net: Customers $ 2,823 &#160; $ 2,522 &#160; Indirect taxes 319 &#160; 240 &#160; Other 199 &#160; 149 &#160; Gross receivables 3,341 &#160; 2,911 &#160; Allowance for credit losses ( 18 ) ( 13 ) Total receivables, net $ 3,323 &#160; $ 2,898 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe table below summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n(in millions) \n\n2022 2021 2020 Beginning balance, January 1 $ ( 13 ) $ ( 11 ) $ ( 6 ) Provision ( 6 ) ( 3 ) ( 11 ) Write-offs &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; Translation adjustment and other 1 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 1 ) Ending balance, December 31 $ ( 18 ) $ ( 13 ) $ ( 11 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nFactoring \n\nThe Company assumed arrangements entered into by Delphi Technologies with various financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables from certain Aftermarket customers in North America and Europe.

Additionally, during the same periods, expenses of $ 5 million, $ 3 million and $ 1 million, respectively, were recognized within interest expense. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNOTE 9 INVENTORIES, NET \n\nA summary of Inventories, net is presented below: ##TABLE_START December 31, \n\n( in millions ) \n\n2022 2021 Raw material and supplies $ 1,203 &#160; $ 1,057 &#160; Work-in-progress 176 &#160; 175 &#160; Finished goods 333 &#160; 327 &#160; FIFO inventories 1,712 &#160; 1,559 &#160; LIFO reserve ( 25 ) ( 25 ) Inventories, net $ 1,687 &#160; $ 1,534 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTE 10 OTHER CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS \n\nAdditional detail related to assets is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, \n\n( in millions) \n\n2022 2021 Prepayments and other current assets: Prepaid tooling $ 82 &#160; $ 81 &#160; Prepaid taxes 40 &#160; 64 &#160; Customer incentive payments (Note 3) 34 &#160; 36 &#160; Derivative instruments 18 &#160; 13 &#160; Contract assets (Note 3) 16 &#160; 17 &#160; Prepaid insurance 11 &#160; 9 &#160; Prepaid engineering 9 &#160; 27 &#160; Other 59 &#160; 74 &#160; Total prepayments and other current assets $ 269 &#160; $ 321 &#160; Investments and long-term receivables: Investment in debt securities $ 455 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Investment in equity affiliates 279 &#160; 298 &#160; Long-term receivables 87 &#160; 102 &#160; Investment in equity securities 75 &#160; 130 &#160; Total investments and long-term receivables $ 896 &#160; $ 530 &#160; Other non-current assets: Deferred income taxes (Note 7) $ 239 &#160; $ 254 &#160; Operating leases (Note 22) 199 &#160; 185 &#160; Customer incentive payments (Note 3) 99 &#160; 137 &#160; Derivative instruments 68 &#160; 8 &#160; Other 63 &#160; 99 &#160; Total other non-current assets $ 668 &#160; $ 683 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNOTE 11 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET \n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and consisted of: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, \n\n( in millions) \n\n2022 2021 Land, land use rights and buildings $ 1,440 &#160; $ 1,504 &#160; Machinery and equipment 5,917 &#160; 5,807 &#160; Finance lease assets 15 &#160; 13 &#160; Construction in progress 610 &#160; 471 &#160; Total property, plant and equipment, gross 7,982 &#160; 7,795 &#160; Less: accumulated depreciation 3,904 &#160; 3,713 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net, excluding tooling 4,078 &#160; 4,082 &#160; Tooling, net of amortization 287 &#160; 313 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net $ 4,365 &#160; $ 4,395 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 18 million, $ 12 million and $ 8 million, respectively. \n\nIn 2022, the Company revised its prior year presentation of fully depreciated assets still in use to include these assets on their respective line items at their gross values with a corresponding increase in accumulated depreciation. \n\nNOTE 12 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a quantitative analysis on each reporting unit to refresh its respective fair value. Prior to 2022, the estimated fair value was determined based on the income approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue, profitability, capital requirements and discount rates. The basis of the income approach is the Company&#8217;s annual budget and long-range plan (&#8220;LRP&#8221;). The annual budget and LRP includes a five-year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. Because the projections are estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainty. For 2022, the estimated fair value was determined using a combined income and market approach. The market approach is based on market multiples (revenue and &#8220;EBITDA&#8221;, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data for comparable companies. The market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company&#8217;s facts and circumstances. \n\nThe Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the Company&#8217;s 2022 goodwill quantitative impairment review are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Discount rates: the Company used a range of 11.0 % to 14.5 % weighted average cost of capital (&#8220;WACC&#8221;) as the discount rates for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant. \n\n&#8226; Operating income margin: the Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\n&#8226; Revenue growth rates: the Company used a global automotive market industry growth rate forecast adjusted to estimate its own market participation for product lines. \n\nIn addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models: \n\n&#8226; The automotive industry is cyclical, and the Company&#8217;s results of operations could be adversely affected by industry downturns. \n\n&#8226; The automotive industry is evolving, and if the Company does not respond appropriately, its results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; The Company is dependent on market segments that use its key products and could be affected by decreasing demand in those segments. \n\n&#8226; The Company is subject to risks related to international operations. \n\nBased on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated the Company&#8217;s goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units was not impaired. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates from those used in acquisition-related valuations and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. Due to the Company&#8217;s recent acquisitions, there is less headroom (the difference between the carrying value and the fair value) associated with certain of the Company&#8217;s reporting units. Based on the impairment testing conducted in 2022, the amounts by which the estimated fair values of the Company&#8217;s goodwill reporting units exceeded their carrying values ranged from 25 % to 153 %. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect the Company&#8217;s financial statements in any given year. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nA summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill is presented in the following tables. The prior period balances have been recast for inter-segment transitions of certain businesses that were completed during 2022.

The Company utilizes the straight-line method of amortization recognized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated future annual amortization expense, primarily for acquired intangible assets, is as follows: $ 95 million in 2023, $ 95 million in 2024, $ 94 million in 2025, $ 86 million in 2026, $ 80 million in 2027 and $ 455 million thereafter. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of an evaluation of the underlying technologies and management of the business subsequent to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company reduced the useful life of certain intangible assets as they no longer provided future economic benefit. This resulted in accelerated amortization expense of $ 38 million and the removal of the related gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of these assets. \n\nA roll forward of the gross carrying amounts and related accumulated amortization of the Company&#8217;s other intangible assets is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START Gross carrying amounts Accumulated amortization (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Beginning balance, January 1 $ 1,513 &#160; $ 1,452 &#160; $ 422 &#160; $ 356 &#160; Acquisitions 1 (Note 2) \n\n132 &#160; 130 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Impairment 2 \n\n( 41 ) ( 14 ) ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; Amortization &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 97 &#160; 88 &#160; Translation adjustment ( 55 ) ( 55 ) ( 18 ) ( 22 ) Ending balance, December 31 $ 1,549 &#160; $ 1,513 &#160; $ 498 &#160; $ 422 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_____________________________ \n\n1 Acquisitions relate to the Company&#8217;s 2022 purchases of Drivetek, Rhombus and Santroll, and the 2021 purchase of AKASOL. \n\n2 During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 30 million to remove an indefinite-lived trade name as the Company no longer plans to utilize this trade name in the business. In 2021, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test over its indefinite-lived trade names, which indicated that for one trade name the fair value was less than the carrying value. Therefore, the Company recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value to the fair value. \n\nNOTE 13 PRODUCT WARRANTY \n\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the product warranty accrual accounts: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 Beginning balance, January 1 $ 236 &#160; $ 253 &#160; Acquisitions/dispositions &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Provisions for current period sales 103 &#160; 83 &#160; Adjustments of prior estimates 1 \n\n14 &#160; 142 &#160; Payments 1 \n\n( 96 ) ( 240 ) Other, primarily translation adjustment ( 12 ) ( 6 ) Ending balance, December 31 $ 245 &#160; $ 236 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_____________________________ \n\n1 In December 2021, the Company settled and paid a warranty claim for $ 130 million. The Company had been working with an OEM customer through the warranty process during 2021, and in December 2021, as a result of discussions that occurred in the fourth quarter, the Company (without admission of liability) and the customer reached an agreement to fully resolve the claim for $ 130 million. This resulted in an adjustment to prior estimates of $ 124 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company is pursuing a partial recovery of this claim through its insurance coverage. No amounts have been recorded to date and there can be no assurance that there will be any recovery. \n\nThe product warranty liability is classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Other current liabilities $ 142 &#160; $ 128 &#160; Other non-current liabilities 103 &#160; 108 &#160; Total product warranty liability $ 245 &#160; $ 236 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNOTE 14 NOTES PAYABLE AND DEBT \n\nThe Company had short-term and long-term debt outstanding as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Short-term debt Short-term borrowings $ 58 &#160; $ 62 &#160; Long-term debt \n\n3.375 % Senior notes due 03/15/25 ($ 500 million par value) \n\n499 &#160; 498 &#160; \n\n5.000 % Senior notes due 10/01/25 ($ 800 million par value) 1 \n\n866 &#160; 889 &#160; \n\n2.650 % Senior notes due 07/01/27 ($ 1,100 million par value) \n\n1,092 &#160; 1,092 &#160; \n\n7.125 % Senior notes due 02/15/29 ($ 121 million par value) \n\n120 &#160; 119 &#160; \n\n1.000 % Senior notes due 05/19/31 (&#8364; 1,000 million par value) \n\n1,051 &#160; 1,117 &#160; \n\n4.375 % Senior notes due 03/15/45 ($ 500 million par value) \n\n495 &#160; 494 &#160; Term loan facilities, finance leases and other 47 &#160; 56 &#160; Total long-term debt 4,170 &#160; 4,265 &#160; Less: current portion 4 &#160; 4 &#160; Long-term debt, net of current portion $ 4,166 &#160; $ 4,261 &#160; ##TABLE_END _____________________________ \n\n1 These notes include the fair value step-up from the Delphi Technologies acquisition.

Interest is payable annually in arrears on May 19 of each year. These senior notes are not guaranteed by any of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries. On June 18, 2021, the Company repaid its &#8364; 500 million 1.80 % senior notes due November 2022 and incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $ 20 million, which is reflected in Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nAnnual principal payments required as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2023 $ 62 &#160; 2024 7 &#160; 2025 1,307 &#160; 2026 7 &#160; 2027 1,106 &#160; After 2027 1,707 &#160; Total payments $ 4,196 &#160; Add: unamortized premiums, net of discount 32 &#160; Total $ 4,228 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s long-term debt includes various covenants, none of which are expected to restrict future operations. \n\nThe Company has a $ 2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility that allows the Company the ability to increase the facility by $ 1 billion with bank group approval. This facility matures in March 2025. The credit agreement contains customary events of default and one key financial covenant, which is a debt-to-EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s commercial paper program allows the Company to issue $ 2 billion of short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes under the limits of its multi-currency revolving credit facility. Under this program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nThe total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed $ 2 billion. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair values of the Company&#8217;s senior unsecured notes totaled $ 3,553 million and $ 4,421 million, respectively. The estimated fair values were $ 570 million lower than carrying value at December 31, 2022 and $ 212 million higher than their carrying value at December 31, 2021. Fair market values of the senior unsecured notes are developed using observable values for similar debt instruments, which are considered Level 2 inputs as defined by ASC Topic 820. The carrying values of the Company&#8217;s multi-currency revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and other debt facilities approximate fair value. The fair value estimates do not necessarily reflect the values the Company could realize in the current markets. \n\nThe Company had outstanding letters of credit of $ 38 million and $ 35 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The letters of credit typically act as guarantees of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNOTE 15 OTHER CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES \n\nAdditional detail related to liabilities is presented in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Other current liabilities: Payroll and employee related $ 398 &#160; $ 330 &#160; Customer related 202 &#160; 220 &#160; Product warranties (Note 13) 142 &#160; 128 &#160; Income taxes payable 142 &#160; 105 &#160; Indirect taxes 125 &#160; 106 &#160; Accrued freight 44 &#160; 46 &#160; Operating leases (Note 22) 42 &#160; 43 &#160; Deferred engineering 39 &#160; 44 &#160; Employee termination benefits (Note 4) 37 &#160; 85 &#160; Supplier related 23 &#160; 18 &#160; Interest 22 &#160; 23 &#160; Dividends payable 21 &#160; 18 &#160; Other non-income taxes 19 &#160; 22 &#160; Insurance 19 &#160; 19 &#160; Earn-out liability 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contract liabilities (Note 3) 16 &#160; 21 &#160; Legal and professional fees 15 &#160; 8 &#160; Retirement related (Note 18) 13 &#160; 16 &#160; Mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest liability (Note 2) &#8212; &#160; 58 &#160; Other 155 &#160; 146 &#160; Total other current liabilities $ 1,490 &#160; $ 1,456 &#160; Other non-current liabilities: Other income tax liabilities $ 242 &#160; $ 274 &#160; Deferred income taxes (Note 7) 194 &#160; 206 &#160; Operating leases (Note 22) 166 &#160; 152 &#160; Product warranties (Note 13) 103 &#160; 108 &#160; Deferred income 66 &#160; 68 &#160; Employee termination benefits (Note 4) 22 &#160; 41 &#160; Other 68 &#160; 115 &#160; Total other non-current liabilities $ 861 &#160; $ 964 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 16 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nASC Topic 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair values as follows: \n\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; \n\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. \n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques noted in ASC Topic 820: \n\nA.

The Company measures the fair value of the insurance asset by projecting expected future cash flows from the contract and discounting them to present value based on current market rates, including an assessment for non-performance risk of the insurance company. The assumptions used to project expected future cash flows are based on actuarial estimates and are unobservable; therefore, the contract is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\n3 Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, their book value approximates their fair value. The Company&#8217;s financial instruments may include long-term debt, investments in equity securities, interest rate and cross-currency swaps, commodity derivative contracts and foreign currency derivative contracts. All derivative contracts are placed with counterparties that have an S&#38;P, or equivalent, investment grade credit rating at the time of the contracts&#8217; placement. An adjustment for non-performance risk is considered in the estimate of fair value in derivative assets based on the counterparty credit default swap (&#8220;CDS&#8221;) rate. When the Company is in a net derivative liability position, the non-performance risk adjustment is based on its CDS rate. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no derivative contracts that contained credit-risk-related contingent features. \n\nThe Company, at times, uses certain commodity derivative contracts to protect against commodity price changes related to forecasted raw material and component purchases. The Company had no outstanding commodity contracts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 . \n\nThe Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. The Company, at times, selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges and cash flow hedges). At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps or options. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to protect against exchange rate movements for forecasted cash flows, including capital expenditures, purchases, operating expenses or sales transactions designated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operating unit. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposure associated with its net investment in certain foreign operations (net investment hedges). Foreign currency derivative contracts require the Company, at a future date, to either buy or sell foreign currency in exchange for the operating units&#8217; local currency. The following foreign currency derivative contracts were outstanding and mature through the ending duration noted below: \n\n##TABLE_START Foreign currency derivatives (in millions) 1 \n\nFunctional currency Traded currency Notional in traded currency December 31, 2022 Notional in traded currency December 31, 2021 Ending duration Brazilian Real U.S. Dollar 14 &#160; 23 &#160; Dec-23 British Pound Euro 10 &#160; 42 &#160; Feb-23 Chinese Renminbi British Pound 23 &#160; 26 &#160; Dec-23 Chinese Renminbi Euro 42 &#160; 26 &#160; Dec-23 Chinese Renminbi U.S. Dollar 276 &#160; 185 &#160; Dec-24 Euro British Pound 63 &#160; 6 &#160; Dec-24 Euro Polish Zloty 489 &#160; 394 &#160; Dec-24 Euro U.S. Dollar 139 &#160; 86 &#160; Dec-24 U.S. Dollar British Pound 17 &#160; 13 &#160; Dec-23 U.S. Dollar Chinese Renminbi 1,402 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Jun-23 U.S. Dollar Euro 45 &#160; 28 &#160; Mar-23 U.S. Dollar Korean Won 51,786 &#160; 49,919 &#160; Nov-23 U.S. Dollar Mexico Peso 3,465 &#160; 2,619 &#160; Dec-24 U.S. Dollar Singapore Dollar &#8212; &#160; 27 &#160; N/A U.S. Dollar Thailand Baht 1,790 &#160; 1,720 &#160; May-23 ##TABLE_END\n\n_____________________________ \n\n1 Table above excludes non-significant traded currency pairings with total notional amounts less than $ 10 million U.S. Dollar equivalent as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nThe Company selectively uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with its net investment in certain foreign operations (net investment hedges). In May 2022, the Company terminated its $ 100 million cross-currency swap contract originally maturing in February 2023 and executed a $ 100 million cross-currency swap contract to mature in February 2029, resulting in cash proceeds of $ 16 million that are expected to remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the net investment is sold, completely liquidated or substantially liquidated.

Under specified conditions, the Company will make contributions to the plans and/or match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. Total expense related to the defined contribution plans was $ 59 million, $ 58 million and $ 38 million in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe Company has a number of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees and their dependents. The defined pension benefits provided are primarily based on (i) years of service and (ii) average compensation or a monthly retirement benefit amount. The Company provides defined benefit pension plans in France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K. and the U.S. The other postretirement employee benefit plans, which provide medical benefits, are unfunded plans. The Company&#8217;s U.S. and U.K. defined benefit plans are frozen, and no additional service cost is being accrued. All pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans in the U.S. have been closed to new employees. The measurement date for all plans is December 31. \n\nOn October 1, 2020, as a result of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company assumed all of the retirement-related liabilities of Delphi Technologies, the most significant of which was the Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme (the &#8220;Scheme&#8221;) in the United Kingdom. On December 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Heads of Terms Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the Trustees of the Scheme related to the future funding of the Scheme. Under the Agreement, the Company eliminated the prior schedule of contributions between Delphi Technologies and the Scheme in exchange for a $ 137 million (&#163; 100 million) one-time contribution into the Scheme Plan by December 31, 2020, which was paid on December 15, 2020. The Agreement also contained other provisions regarding the implementation of a revised asset investment strategy as well as a funding progress test that will be performed every three years to determine if additional contributions need to be made into the Scheme by the Company. \n\nThe following table summarizes the expenses for the Company&#8217;s defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans and the other postretirement defined employee benefit plans: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Defined contribution expense $ 59 &#160; $ 58 &#160; $ 38 &#160; Defined benefit pension (income) expense ( 10 ) ( 19 ) 15 &#160; Other postretirement employee benefit income ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Total $ 48 &#160; $ 38 &#160; $ 52 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe following provides a roll forward of the plans&#8217; benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and recognition in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension benefits Other postretirement Year Ended December 31, employee benefits &#160; 2022 2021 Year Ended December 31, (in millions) U.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. 2022 2021 Change in projected benefit obligation: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Projected benefit obligation, January 1 $ 183 &#160; $ 2,227 &#160; $ 202 &#160; $ 2,527 &#160; $ 54 &#160; $ 65 &#160; Service cost &#8212; &#160; 20 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Interest cost 4 &#160; 37 &#160; 3 &#160; 30 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Plan amendments &#8212; &#160; ( 11 ) &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Settlement and curtailment ( 6 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 13 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Actuarial gain ( 33 ) ( 685 ) ( 7 ) ( 208 ) ( 13 ) ( 6 ) Currency translation &#8212; &#160; ( 200 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 59 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Acquisition &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Benefits paid ( 12 ) ( 71 ) ( 11 ) ( 76 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) \n\nProjected benefit obligation, December 31 1 \n\n$ 136 &#160; $ 1,322 &#160; $ 183 &#160; $ 2,227 &#160; $ 37 &#160; $ 54 &#160; Change in plan assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Fair value of plan assets, January 1 $ 177 &#160; $ 2,049 &#160; $ 187 &#160; $ 2,041 &#160; &#160; &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 33 ) ( 655 ) 5 &#160; 110 &#160; &#160; &#160; Employer contribution 2 &#160; 20 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; &#160; Settlements ( 5 ) ( 4 ) ( 4 ) ( 11 ) Currency translation &#8212; &#160; ( 189 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 39 ) &#160; &#160; Acquisition &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Benefits paid ( 12 ) ( 71 ) ( 11 ) ( 76 ) &#160; &#160; Fair value of plan assets, December 31 $ 129 &#160; $ 1,156 &#160; $ 177 &#160; $ 2,049 &#160; Funded status $ ( 7 ) $ ( 166 ) $ ( 6 ) $ ( 178 ) $ ( 37 ) $ ( 54 ) Amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Non-current assets $ &#8212; &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 68 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Current liabilities ( 1 ) ( 6 ) ( 2 ) ( 7 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Non-current liabilities ( 6 ) ( 186 ) ( 4 ) ( 239 ) ( 31 ) ( 47 ) Net amount $ ( 7 ) $ ( 166 ) $ ( 6 ) $ ( 178 ) $ ( 37 ) $ ( 54 ) Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net actuarial loss $ 80 &#160; $ 104 &#160; $ 84 &#160; $ 74 &#160; $ ( 3 ) $ 10 &#160; Net prior service (credit) cost ( 3 ) ( 9 ) ( 3 ) 2 &#160; ( 11 ) ( 13 ) Net amount $ 77 &#160; $ 95 &#160; $ 81 &#160; $ 76 &#160; $ ( 14 ) $ ( 3 ) Total accumulated benefit obligation for all plans $ 136 &#160; $ 1,279 &#160; $ 183 &#160; $ 2,183 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_____________________________ \n\n1 The decrease in the projected benefit obligation was primarily due to actuarial gains during the period.

The Company believes these ranges represent an appropriate risk profile for the planned benefit payments of the plans based on the timing of the estimated benefit payments. In each asset \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\ncategory, separate portfolios are maintained for additional diversification. Investment managers are retained in each asset category to manage each portfolio against its benchmark. Each investment manager has appropriate investment guidelines. In addition, the entire portfolio is evaluated against a relevant peer group. The defined benefit pension plans did not hold any Company securities as investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. A portion of pension assets is invested in common and commingled trusts. \n\nThe Company expects to contribute a total of $ 20 million to $ 30 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2023.

The unrecognized amount of compensation expense is based on projected performance as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe amounts expensed and common stock issued for performance share units for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Expense (in millions) Number of shares issued (in thousands) Expense (in millions) Number of shares issued (in thousands) Expense (in millions) Number of shares issued (in thousands) Total Stockholder Return $ 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 5 &#160; 165 &#160; Other Performance-Based 31 &#160; 305 &#160; 18 &#160; 148 &#160; 5 &#160; 340 &#160; Total $ 38 &#160; 305 &#160; $ 24 &#160; 148 &#160; $ 10 &#160; 505 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nA summary of the status of the Company&#8217;s nonvested performance share units for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Total Stockholder Return Other Performance-Based Number of shares (in thousands) Weighted average grant date fair value Number of shares (in thousands) Weighted average grant date fair value Nonvested at January 1, 2020 240 &#160; $ 64.61 &#160; 240 &#160; $ 48.52 &#160; Granted 137 &#160; $ 28.55 &#160; 253 &#160; $ 34.15 &#160; Vested ( 89 ) $ 69.75 &#160; ( 89 ) $ 51.29 &#160; Forfeited ( 17 ) $ 57.36 &#160; ( 19 ) $ 44.19 &#160; Nonvested at December 31, 2020 271 &#160; $ 45.20 &#160; 385 &#160; $ 38.66 &#160; Granted 135 &#160; $ 70.39 &#160; 404 &#160; $ 45.30 &#160; Vested ( 143 ) $ 47.93 &#160; ( 143 ) $ 41.92 &#160; Forfeited ( 4 ) $ 37.28 &#160; ( 6 ) $ 36.79 &#160; Nonvested at December 31, 2021 259 &#160; $ 56.90 &#160; 640 &#160; $ 42.14 &#160; Granted 138 &#160; $ 66.96 &#160; 415 &#160; $ 44.33 &#160; Vested ( 127 ) $ 28.55 &#160; ( 234 ) $ 34.73 &#160; Forfeited ( 20 ) $ 59.87 &#160; ( 56 ) $ 43.35 &#160; Nonvested at December 31, 2022 250 &#160; $ 76.68 &#160; 765 &#160; $ 45.51 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNOTE 20 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS \n\nThe following table summarizes the activity within accumulated other comprehensive loss: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Foreign currency translation adjustments Hedge instruments Defined benefit postretirement plans Total Beginning Balance, January 1, 2020 $ ( 497 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 230 ) $ ( 727 ) Comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications 133 &#160; ( 1 ) ( 131 ) 1 &#160; Income taxes associated with comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications 43 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; 61 &#160; Reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 16 &#160; 17 &#160; Income taxes reclassified into net earnings &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Ending Balance December 31, 2020 $ ( 321 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 330 ) $ ( 651 ) Comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications 1 \n\n( 59 ) ( 4 ) 255 &#160; 192 &#160; Income taxes associated with comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications ( 43 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 64 ) ( 107 ) Reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; 14 &#160; 18 &#160; Income taxes reclassified into net earnings &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Ending Balance December 31, 2021 $ ( 423 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 128 ) $ ( 551 ) Comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications ( 287 ) 4 &#160; ( 14 ) ( 297 ) Income taxes associated with comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications ( 40 ) &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; ( 33 ) Reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; 7 &#160; Income taxes reclassified into net earnings &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Ending Balance December 31, 2022 $ ( 750 ) $ 4 &#160; $ ( 130 ) $ ( 876 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n_____________________________ \n\n1 The increase in the defined benefit postretirement plans comprehensive income before reclassifications is primarily due to actuarial gains during the period. Refer to Note 18 &#8220;Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; for more information. \n\nThe change in other comprehensive income for the Company&#8217;s noncontrolling interest entities is related to foreign currency translation. \n\nNOTE 21 CONTINGENCIES \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company&#8217;s management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. An adverse outcome could, nonetheless, be material to the results of operations or cash flows. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nThe Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (&#8220;PRPs&#8221;) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;Superfund&#8221;) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may be presently \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nliable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 26 such sites as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula. \n\nThe Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material, or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter. \n\nThe Company has an accrual for environmental liabilities of $ 7 million as of each of December 31, 2022 and 2021, included in Other current and Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This accrual, which relates to eight of the sites, is based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of which are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; and remediation alternatives). Clean-up and other remedial activities are complete or nearing completion at the other 18 sites, for which there was no accrual as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nNOTE 22 LEASES AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe Company&#8217;s lease agreements primarily consist of real estate property, such as manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and office buildings, in addition to personal property, such as vehicles, manufacturing and information technology equipment. The Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. The majority of the Company&#8217;s lease arrangements are comprised of fixed payments, and a limited number of these arrangements include a variable payment component based on certain index fluctuations. As of December 31, 2022, a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s leases were classified as operating leases. \n\nGenerally, the Company&#8217;s operating leases have renewal options that extend the lease terms, and some include options to terminate the agreement or purchase the leased asset. The amortizable life of these assets is the lesser of its useful life or the lease term, including renewal periods reasonably assured of being exercised at lease inception. \n\nAll leases with an initial term of 12 months or less without an option to extend or purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (&#8220;short-term leases&#8221;) are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe following table presents the lease assets and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Assets Balance Sheet Location Operating leases Other non-current assets $ 199 &#160; $ 185 &#160; Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 10 &#160; 11 &#160; Total lease assets $ 209 &#160; $ 196 &#160; Liabilities Current Operating leases Other current liabilities $ 42 &#160; $ 43 &#160; Finance leases Notes payable and other short-term debt 3 &#160; 2 &#160; Non-current Operating leases Other non-current liabilities 166 &#160; 152 &#160; Finance leases Long-term debt 9 &#160; 11 &#160; Total lease liabilities $ 220 &#160; $ 208 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents lease obligations arising from obtaining leased assets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Operating leases $ 39 &#160; $ 27 &#160; Finance leases 2 &#160; 1 &#160; Total lease obligations $ 41 &#160; $ 28 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the maturity of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Operating leases Finance leases 2023 $ 47 &#160; $ 2 &#160; 2024 40 &#160; 2 &#160; 2025 37 &#160; 2 &#160; 2026 32 &#160; 2 &#160; 2027 26 &#160; 2 &#160; After 2027 44 &#160; 3 &#160; Total (undiscounted) lease payments $ 226 &#160; $ 13 &#160; Less: Imputed interest 18 &#160; 1 &#160; Present value of lease liabilities $ 208 &#160; $ 12 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded operating lease expense of $ 50 million, $ 57 million and $ 29 million, respectively. \n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the operating cash flows for operating leases were $ 50 million, $ 54 million and $ 29 million, respectively. \n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded short-term lease costs of $ 25 million, $ 21 million and $ 21 million, respectively. \n\nFinance lease costs and related cash flows were immaterial for the periods presented. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nASC Topic 842, &#8220;Leases&#8221;, requires that the rate implicit in the lease be used if readily determinable. Generally, implicit rates are not readily determinable in the Company&#8217;s agreements, so the incremental borrowing rate is used instead for such lease arrangements. The incremental borrowing rates are determined using rates specific to the term of the lease, economic environments where lease activity is concentrated, value of lease portfolio, and assuming full collateralization of the loans. The following table presents the terms and discount rates: ##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) Operating leases 6 7 Finance leases 6 7 Weighted average discount rate Operating leases 2.2 &#160; % 2.0 &#160; % Finance leases 3.2 &#160; % 3.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTE 23 EARNINGS PER SHARE \n\nThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the reporting period. \n\nThe dilutive impact of stock-based compensation is calculated using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes that the Company uses the assumed proceeds from the exercise of awards to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the purchase price that the grantee will pay in the future and compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized. The dilutive effects of performance-based stock awards described in Note 19, &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share at the level the related performance criteria are met through the respective balance sheet date. There were 0.8 million, 0.8 million and 0.2 million of performance share units excluded from the computation of the diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, because the related performance criteria had not been met as of the balance sheet dates. \n\nAs a result of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, approximately 37 million shares were issued on October 1, 2020, which resulted in dilution of approximately 9 million shares on a year-to-date basis. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions except share and per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Basic earnings per share: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ 944 &#160; $ 537 &#160; $ 500 &#160; Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 235.5 &#160; 238.1 &#160; 213.0 &#160; Basic earnings per share of common stock $ 4.01 &#160; $ 2.25 &#160; $ 2.35 &#160; Diluted earnings per share: &#160; &#160; Net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ 944 &#160; $ 537 &#160; $ 500 &#160; Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 235.5 &#160; 238.1 &#160; 213.0 &#160; Effect of stock-based compensation 1.3 &#160; 1.4 &#160; 1.0 &#160; Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding including dilutive shares 236.8 &#160; 239.5 &#160; 214.0 &#160; Diluted earnings per share of common stock $ 3.99 &#160; $ 2.24 &#160; $ 2.34 &#160; Antidilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 24 REPORTING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is aggregated into four reporting segments which are further described below. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company announced that the starter and alternator business, previously reported in its e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment, would transition to the Aftermarket segment. The Company also announced in 2022 that the canisters and fuel delivery modules business, previously reported in its Air Management segment, would transition to the Fuel Systems segment. Both of these transitions were completed during the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company moved its battery systems business, previously reported in its Air Management segment, to the e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment. Related to these transitions, the Company also revised the allocation of Corporate assets to various reporting segments in 2022. The reporting segment disclosures have been updated accordingly which included recasting prior period information for the new reporting structure. \n\n&#8226; Air Management. This segment develops and manufactures products to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and enhance performance. The Air Management segment&#8217;s technologies include turbochargers, eBoosters, eTurbos, timing systems, emissions systems, thermal systems, gasoline ignition technology, smart remote actuators, powertrain sensors, cabin heaters, battery heaters, battery charging and direct current charging stations. \n\n&#8226; e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain. This segment develops and manufactures products to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and enhance performance in combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. The e-Propulsion &#38; Drivetrain segment&#8217;s technologies include rotating electrical components, power electronics, electric drive motors, battery systems, battery packs, control modules, software, friction and mechanical products for automatic transmissions and torque-management products. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\n&#8226; Fuel Systems (formerly known as Fuel Injection). This segment includes gasoline and diesel fuel injection components and systems. The fuel injection systems portfolio includes pumps, injectors, evaporative canisters, fuel delivery modules, fuel rails and fuel rail assemblies, engine control units, and complete systems including associated software and calibration services, that deliver greater efficiency and improve fuel economy for traditional and hybrid vehicles. \n\n&#8226; Aftermarket. Through this segment, the Company sells products and services to independent aftermarket customers and original equipment service customers with both new and remanufactured products. The aftermarket product portfolio includes a wide range of solutions covering the fuel injection, electronics and engine management, starters and alternators, maintenance, test equipment and vehicle diagnostics categories. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated the definition of its measure of segment income or loss to exclude the impact of intangible asset amortization expense. The Company believes this change improves comparability of ongoing operations given the increasing operating margin impact of intangible asset amortization arising from the Company&#8217;s merger and acquisition activity. The prior period information disclosed below has been recast to reflect this change. Further, the Company renamed its measure of segment income or loss from Segment Adjusted EBIT to Segment Adjusted Operating Income. \n\nSegment Adjusted Operating Income is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. Segment Adjusted Operating Income is comprised of operating income adjusted for restructuring, merger, acquisition and divestiture expense, intangible asset amortization expense, impairment charges and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss. The Company believes Segment Adjusted Operating Income is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of its reporting segments. \n\nThe following tables show segment information and Segment Adjusted Operating Income for the Company&#8217;s reporting segments: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Segment information Net sales Year-end assets Depreciation/ amortization Long-lived asset expenditures 1 \n\n(in millions) Customers Inter-segment Net Air Management $ 7,034 &#160;

      "text": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. However, the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. \n\nThe Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company&#8217;s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in &#8220;Internal Control - Integrated Framework&#8221; (2013). Management excluded from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting Santroll Automotive Components, which was acquired on March 31, 2022, Rhombus Energy Solutions, which was acquired on July 29, 2022 and Drivetek AG, which was acquired on December 1, 2022. In aggregate, these acquisitions accounted for less than 1% of consolidated total assets and less than 1% of consolidated net sales, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. \n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 as stated in its report included herein. \n\n&#160; \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\n&#160; \n\nThere have been no changes in internal control over the financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n"
