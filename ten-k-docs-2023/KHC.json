      "text": " Item 1. Business. \n\nGeneral \n\nWe are driving transformation at The Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC), inspired by our Purpose, Let&#8217;s Make Life Delicious . Consumers are at the center of everything we do. With 2022 net sales of approximately $26 billion, we are committed to growing our iconic and emerging food and beverage brands on a global scale. We leverage our scale and agility to unleash the full power of Kraft Heinz across a portfolio of six consumer-driven product platforms. As global citizens, we&#8217;re dedicated to making a sustainable, ethical impact while helping to feed the world in healthy, responsible ways. \n\nOn July 2, 2015, through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (&#8220;Kraft&#8221;) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (&#8220;Heinz&#8221;) (the &#8220;2015 Merger&#8221;). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company, and H. J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company. \n\nBefore the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&#8220;Berkshire Hathaway&#8221;) and 3G Global Food Holdings, LP (&#8220;3G Global Food Holdings&#8221; and, together with its affiliates, &#8220;3G Capital&#8221;), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013 (the &#8220;2013 Heinz Acquisition&#8221;). \n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to years and quarters contained herein pertain to our fiscal years and fiscal quarters. Our 2022 fiscal year was a 53-week period that ended on December 31, 2022, our 2021 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 25, 2021, and our 2020 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 26, 2020. \n\nReportable Segments: \n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. \n\nSee Note 20, Segment Reporting , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for our geographic financial information by segment. \n\nResources \n\nTrademarks and Intellectual Property: \n\nOur trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Significant trademarks by segment based on net sales in 2022 were: \n\n##TABLE_START Majority Owned and Licensed Trademarks North America Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Capri Sun*, Maxwell House, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O International Heinz, ABC, Master, Kraft, Quero, Golden Circle, Wattie&#8217;s, Plasmon, Pudliszki ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; *Used under license. \n\nWe sell certain products under brands we license from third parties. In 2022, brands used under licenses from third parties included Capri Sun packaged drink pouches for sale in the United States. We also grant certain licenses to third parties to use our intellectual property rights in select jurisdictions. In 2021, in our agreements with an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis (&#8220;Lactalis&#8221;), related to the sale of certain assets in our global cheese business, we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in perpetuity, including perpetual licenses for the Kraft and Velveeta brands for certain cheese products. \n\nWe also own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nOur issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. \n\nRaw Materials and Packaging: \n\nWe manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw materials. We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, fiberboard, metals, and cardboard to package our products, and we use electricity, diesel fuel, and natural gas in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories, such as corrugated paper and energy, we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers, including large, international producers and smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy, and agricultural programs. In 2022, we continued to experience higher commodity costs and supply chain costs, including procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs, largely due to inflationary pressures. We expect these costs to continue to increase and inflation to remain elevated through 2023. \n\nOur procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices. Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nOur research and development efforts focus on achieving the following four objectives: \n\n&#8226; product innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs, support our environmental and sustainability goals, and drive growth; \n\n&#8226; world-class and uncompromising food safety, quality, and consistency; \n\n&#8226; superior, customer-preferred product and package performance; and \n\n&#8226; continuous process, product, and supply chain optimization. \n\nCompetition \n\nOur products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which continue to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers, large-format retailers, and discounters. Our competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies. We compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete on the basis of product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences. Improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures. \n\nSales \n\nSales and Customers: \n\nOur products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative, and independent grocery accounts; convenience, value, and club stores; pharmacies and drug stores; mass merchants; foodservice distributors; and institutions, including hotels, restaurants, bakeries, hospitals, health care facilities, and government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various e-commerce platforms and retailers. \n\nWe have key customers in different regions around the world. In 2022, the five largest customers in our North America segment accounted for approximately 46% of North America segment net sales and the five largest customers in our International segment accounted for approximately 14% of International segment net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2022 and approximately 22% of our net sales in each of 2021 and 2020. Both of our segments have sales to Walmart Inc. \n\nWe manage our sales portfolio through six consumer-driven product platforms. A platform is a lens created for the portfolio based on a grouping of real consumer needs and includes the following for Kraft Heinz: Taste Elevation, Fast Fresh Meals, Easy Meals Made Better, Real Food Snacking, Flavorful Hydration, and Easy Indulgent Desserts. The platforms are modular and configurable by reportable segment and market. Further, each platform is assigned a role within our business to help inform our resource allocation and investment decisions, which are made at the reportable segment level. These roles include: Grow, Energize, and Stabilize. The role of a platform may also vary by reportable segment and market. The platform approach helps us to manage our business efficiently, including the oversight of our various product categories and brands, and transforms the way we plan for our growth. \n\nNet Sales by Platform: \n\nNet sales by platform as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the periods presented were: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Taste Elevation 31 % 28 % 26 % Fast Fresh Meals 23 % 25 % 26 % Easy Meals Made Better 20 % 19 % 19 % Real Food Snacking 5 % 7 % 9 % Flavorful Hydration 8 % 7 % 6 % Easy Indulgent Desserts 4 % 4 % 4 % Other 9 % 10 % 10 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Sales by Product Category: \n\nThe product categories that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Condiments and sauces 31 % 28 % 26 % Cheese and dairy 15 % 19 % 20 % Ambient foods 12 % 11 % 11 % Frozen and chilled foods 11 % 10 % 10 % Meats and seafood 10 % 10 % 10 % ##TABLE_END\n\nSeasonality \n\nAlthough crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, the majority of our products are produced throughout the year. \n\nSeasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. While these factors influence our quarterly net sales, operating income/(loss), and cash flows at the product level, unless the timing of such events shift period-over-period (e.g., a shift in Easter timing), this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment results. \n\nGovernment Regulation \n\nThe manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated. Our business operations, including the production, transportation, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, quality, and safety of our products and their ingredients, and our occupational safety, health, and privacy practices, are subject to various laws and regulations. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous laws and regulations outside of the United States in markets where our products are manufactured, distributed, or sold, including laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;), the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, and various other anti-corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, regulatory regime changes may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts. \n\nEnvironmental Regulation: \n\nOur activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters. Various laws concerning the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations. \n\nIn the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;). CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. We are involved in a number of active proceedings in the United States under CERCLA (and other state actions under similar legislation) related to certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for which we retain liability. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our general compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and, thus, future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves. \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nWe are driven by our Purpose, our Vision&#8212; To sustainably grow by delighting more consumers globally , and our Values&#8212; We are consumer obsessed , We dare to do better every day , We champion great people , We demand diversity , We do the right thing , and We own it . We recognize that a strong company culture is vital to our overall success. Our Purpose, Vision, and Values are the foundation upon which our culture is built. They represent the expectations we have for ourselves and the environment we aspire to create for our Company. \n\nOur people are at the heart of who we are at Kraft Heinz. We drive growth through development opportunities, career ownership, and autonomy and recognize and reward outstanding performance at every level, creating a true spirit of meritocracy. We strive to channel our employees&#8217; passion, curiosity, and attitude to make an impact on our future and our legacy by leading as learners, acting as owners, and being change agents. Our Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;), through the Human Capital and Compensation Committee, oversees our human resources strategy, key policies, and our 2025 diversity, inclusion, and belonging aspirations. \n\nEngagement and Retention: \n\nWe are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining diverse, world-class talent and creating an engaging and inclusive culture that embodies our Purpose, Vision, and Values. As of December 31, 2022, Kraft Heinz had approximately 37,000 employees globally. Driven by our Value We champion great people , we support our employees&#8217; health, safety, and professional development and reward outstanding performance at every level. Our compensation, benefits, recognition, and LiveWell programs are designed to attract and engage highly skilled talent, meet individual and family needs, and inspire, celebrate, and engage our people and teams through active listening channels. \n\nGuided by our Values, we conduct a global engagement survey annually to provide employees with an opportunity to share anonymous feedback with management across a variety of topic areas. The results, and comments are reviewed by the Board, senior leadership, managers, and human resources to help determine where changes are needed to support our people and teams. \n\nWellbeing and Safety: \n\nOur employees&#8217; health, safety, and wellbeing are a top priority. We establish and administer company-wide policies and processes to protect the health, safety, and security of our employees, subcontractors, and all those who visit our facilities, and to comply with applicable regulations. We review and monitor our performance closely to drive continuous improvement. To help us evaluate how effective our safety efforts are in lowering incidents rates, we use a Total Recordable Incident Rate (&#8220;TRIR&#8221;). TRIR is a medical incident rate based on the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) record-keeping criteria (injuries per 200,000 hours). Our TRIR globally was 0.53 in 2022 and 0.62 in 2021. \n\nOur global LiveWell program addresses physical, emotional, financial, and social health and wellbeing. We champion the LiveWell program&#8217;s holistic approach to wellbeing with enhanced programs, including healthcare benefits, disability, and employee assistance initiatives. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging: \n\nWe live our Value of We demand diversity by focusing on three strategic areas: hiring and growing talent from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, developing inclusive leaders, and tracking and reporting our progress. Our Global Inclusion Council has been established to create strategic accountability for results. It also provides governance and oversight of reporting on diversity efforts and initiatives. The Council is comprised of executive leaders and members of the Board. In 2021, we shared our 2025 diversity, inclusion, and belonging aspirations, which include that 50% of our global management positions be filled by women and 30% of our salaried U.S. employee population identify as people of color. As of December 31, 2022: \n\n&#8226; 41% of employees in management positions globally identified as women; \n\n&#8226; 28% of salaried employees in the U.S. identified as people of color; \n\n&#8226; 40% of our Executive Leadership Team identified as women; and \n\n&#8226; 80% of our Executive Leadership Team identified as people of color. \n\nAs we work to meet our 2025 aspirations, we are focused on: \n\n&#8226; Hiring and Growing Talent from Diverse Backgrounds and Perspectives through expanded recruiting partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and training and leveraging artificial intelligence in our hiring process to reduce bias. In addition, our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) offer learning and development opportunities and create a network of support for employees. \n\n&#8226; Developing Inclusive Leaders through an interactive learning experience for managers on interrupting bias in our Organizational People Review process and their role in creating an inclusive environment. \n\n&#8226; Tracking and Reporting Our Progress year over year through oversight by the Kraft Heinz Global Inclusion Council. \n\nLearning and Development: \n\nThrough Kraft Heinz Ownerversity, we provide learning and development offerings to employees via live and virtual learning experiences. These offerings enable employees to execute with excellence in their roles, accelerate their learning curves, and grow great careers through continuous learning. With Ownerversity&#8217;s targeted platforms, employees can focus on timely and topical development areas including leadership, management excellence, functional capabilities, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. In 2022, our global women&#8217;s accelerator program, The WE Network, won a Brandon Hall Gold Award for Best Advance in Leadership Development for Women. \n\nRewards and Compensation: \n\nOur Total Rewards strategy is designed to provide an array of meaningful and flexible programs for our diverse workforce. Total Rewards includes compensation elements of salary and wages and incentives, healthcare, savings and insurance plans, wellbeing plans, employee recognition programs, and other voluntary elected benefits. We aim for global consistency while respecting local market practices. The plans are designed to be market competitive and data-driven to promote our high-performance and results-oriented culture and realize our Purpose to Make Life Delicious for employees and their families. \n\nEthics and Transparency: \n\nThe Kraft Heinz Ethics Helpline is available to our partners, suppliers, customers, and consumers to ask questions or report potential violations of various policies and ethical guidelines, including our Code of Conduct, Supplier Guiding Principles, and Global Human Rights Policy. \n\nWe report more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives related to our people and human capital management in our Environmental Social Governance Report (&#8220;ESG Report&#8221;).

      "section": "1A",
      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered when evaluating Kraft Heinz. Although the risks are organized and described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed the material risks affecting our business below, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future. \n\nIndustry Risks \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. \n\nThe food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers and retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences. \n\nWe may need to reduce our prices, or be restricted or delayed in our ability to increase prices, in response to competitive, customer, consumer, regulatory, or macroeconomic pressures, including pressures related to private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. These pressures have restricted, and may in the future continue to restrict, our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases, including those related to inflationary pressures. Additionally, we expect that there could be a difference between the timing of when we take pricing actions and the impact of those beneficial actions on our results of operations. Failure to effectively assess, timely change, and properly set pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact our ability to achieve our objectives. \n\nThe rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases, including those related to inflationary pressures. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product, platform, or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our profitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline. \n\nOur success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation. \n\nConsumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences, including with respect to health and wellness. If we do not offer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nMoreover, weak economic conditions, recessions, inflation, severe or unusual weather events, global or local pandemics, including COVID-19, as well as other factors, could affect consumer preferences and demand, at times, causing a strain on our supply chain due, in part, to retailers, distributors, or carriers modifying their restocking, fulfillment, or shipping practices. Failure to adequately respond to these changes could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nWe must distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied consumer base, we must offer an array of products that satisfies a broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or platforms, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster-growing or more profitable categories, demand for our products could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nProlonged negative perceptions concerning the health, environmental, or social implications of certain food and beverage products, ingredients, or packaging materials could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of our products and marketing programs. Our ability to refine the ingredient and nutrition profiles of and packaging for our products as well as to maintain focus on ethical sourcing and supply chain management opportunities to address evolving consumer preferences are important to our growth. We strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nIn addition, our growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings. We may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. Successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect, and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nChanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance. \n\nRetail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors in our major markets, may continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business across various channels. These larger customers may seek to leverage their positions to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency, lower pricing, more favorable terms, increased promotional programs, or specifically tailored product offerings. In addition, larger retailers have scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products. Retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nRetail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers&#8217; business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding adverse effect on us, which could be material. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nIn addition, technology-based systems, which give consumers the ability to shop through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes, we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nChanges in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers, or in other business relationships, could adversely impact us. \n\nWe derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers (see Sales and Customers within Item 1, Business ). Some or all of our significant customers may not continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nDisputes with significant suppliers, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, terminations of relationships with other significant contractual counterparties, including licensors, could adversely affect our portfolio, product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nIn addition, the financial condition of such customers, suppliers, and other significant contractual counterparties are affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control. Significant deteriorations in the financial conditions of significant customers or suppliers, or in other business relationships, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nMaintaining, extending, and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success. \n\nWe have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition across the globe. Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings. \n\nWe seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product innovation. Negative perceptions of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of our marketing practices. Moreover, adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us, our quality and safety, our environmental or social impacts, our other environmental, social, human capital, or governance practices, our products becoming unavailable to consumers, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers&#8217; or consumers&#8217; confidence, and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. Furthermore, \n\nexisting or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions, and marketing, or our response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend, and expand our brands. \n\nIn addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information, including misinformation, and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In addition, we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts, anticipate consumer preferences, or invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image. If we do not maintain, extend, and expand our reputation or brand image, then our product sales, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products. \n\nIn nearly all of our product categories, we compete with branded products as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. Our products must provide higher value or quality to consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness or inflation. Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors&#8217; products or if consumers perceive such a change. If consumers prefer private label products, then we could lose market share or sales volume, or our product mix could shift to lower margin offerings. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital, marketing, and other expenditures, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nWe may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories or platforms, increase our market share, or add products that are in faster-growing and more profitable categories. \n\nOur future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories or platforms as well as growth in the food and beverage industry in the geographies in which we operate. Our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster-growing and more profitable categories or platforms and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories or platforms. Our failure to drive revenue growth, limit market share decreases in our key product categories or platforms, or develop innovative products for new and existing categories or platforms could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nProduct recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us. \n\nSelling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. We have decided and could in the future decide to, and have been or could in the future be required to, recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination, adulteration, product mislabeling or misbranding, tampering, undeclared allergens, or other deficiencies. Product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time. \n\nWe could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. Adverse attention about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation, discourage consumers from buying our products, or cause production and delivery disruptions that could negatively impact our net sales and financial condition. \n\nWe may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury, illness, or death. In addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall, may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit, or is not pursued to conclusion, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nClimate change and legal or regulatory responses may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. \n\nGlobal average temperatures are gradually increasing due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is projected to contribute to significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters, and changes in agricultural productivity. Increasing concern over climate change may adversely impact demand for our products, or increase our operating costs, due to changes in consumer preferences that cause consumers to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have a high climate change impact. \n\nIncreased natural disasters and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of natural resources and commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products, and could further decrease food security for communities around the world. Climate change, and its environmental impacts, could also affect our ability, and our suppliers&#8217; ability, to procure necessary commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to increase costs or make additional unplanned capital expenditures. Further, an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters could result in disruptions for us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, co-manufacturers, and distributors and impact our employees&#8217; abilities to commute or work from home effectively. These disruptions could make it more difficult and costly for us to deliver our products, obtain raw materials or other supplies through our supply chain, maintain or resume operations, or perform other critical corporate functions, could reduce customer demand for our products, and could increase the cost of insurance. \n\nAdditionally, there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations, and sustainability. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change, as well as additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment could be costly and may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the running of our manufacturing and processing facilities and our business, as well as increase distribution and supply chain costs. Moreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations and long-term operating plans, which will likely incur substantial time, attention, and costs. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. \n\nFinally, we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media, stockholders, activists, and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. Such failure, or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional regulatory requirements regarding climate change, whether or not valid, could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business and reputation. Additionally, from time to time we establish and publicly announce environmental, social, and governance goals, commitments, and aspirations, including to reduce our impact on the environment. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements, the pace of changes in technology, the availability of requisite financing, and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. Furthermore, standards for tracking and reporting such matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting this data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations, and other changes in circumstances. Our processes and controls for reporting sustainability and other matters across our operations and supply chain are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting sustainability metrics, including sustainability-related disclosures that may be required by the SEC and European and other regulators, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. If we fail to achieve, or are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving, or improperly report on our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments, it could negatively affect consumer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. \n\nBusiness Risks \n\nWe may not successfully identify, complete, or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures, or investments. \n\nFrom time to time, we have evaluated and may continue to evaluate acquisition candidates, alliances, joint ventures, or investments that may strategically fit our business objectives, and, as a result of some of these evaluations, we have acquired businesses or assets that we deem to be a strategic fit. We have also divested and may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets. These activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks including, but not limited to, diversion of management&#8217;s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties in integrating, or inability to successfully integrate, acquired businesses, including integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems; inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population; adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships; and potential disputes with buyers, sellers, or partners. Activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. We have in the past and may in the future be required to obtain approval of these transactions by competition authorities or to satisfy other legal requirements, and we may be unable to obtain such approvals or satisfy such requirements, each of which may result in additional costs, time delays, or our inability to complete such transactions, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nTo the extent we undertake acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, investments, or other developments in new geographies or categories, we may face additional risks related to such developments. For example, risks related to foreign operations are discussed below under the risk factor titled &#8220; Our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline. &#8221; \n\nTo the extent we undertake divestitures, we may face additional risks related to such activities. For example, risks related to our ability to find appropriate buyers, execute transactions on favorable terms, separate divested business operations with minimal impact to our remaining operations, and effectively manage any transitional service arrangements. Further, our divestiture activities have in the past required, and may in the future require, us to recognize impairment charges. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives. \n\nWe plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets. Consumer demands, behaviors, tastes, and purchasing trends may differ in these markets and, as a result, our sales strategies may not be successful and our product sales may not meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems, and other operations. Additionally, we may not successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives, including achieving any previously announced productivity efficiencies and financial targets, any new business may not be profitable or meet our expectations, or any divestiture may not be completed without disruption. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline. \n\nWe are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets. Approximately 30% of our 2022 net sales were generated outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by market, are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section, and also include: \n\n&#8226; compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery and corruption laws such as the FCPA; \n\n&#8226; changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax laws or their interpretations, or tax audit implications; \n\n&#8226; the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, or similar restrictions on our sales or imports, trade agreements, regulations, taxes, or policies that might negatively affect our sales or costs; \n\n&#8226; foreign currency devaluations or fluctuations in foreign currency values, including risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in foreign currency exchange markets and the decisions made and positions taken to hedge such volatility; \n\n&#8226; compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, human rights laws, and a variety of other local, national, and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions; \n\n&#8226; discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictions; \n\n&#8226; changes in capital controls, including foreign currency exchange controls, governmental foreign currency policies, or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States; \n\n&#8226; challenges associated with cross-border product distribution, including economic sanctions, export controls, and labor restrictions; \n\n&#8226; changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; \n\n&#8226; risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, military conflict, corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate; \n\n&#8226; the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application, and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights; \n\n&#8226; changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations; \n\n&#8226; greater risk of uncollectible accounts or trade receivables and longer collection cycles; and \n\n&#8226; design, implementation, and use of effective control environment processes across our various operations and employee base. \n\nSlow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. Any of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands. \n\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, trade dress, copyrights, and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and trade dress laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements, policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property, and securing our information technology systems. Our failure to develop or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business, and financial condition. We also license certain intellectual property, most notably trademarks, from third parties. To the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties, our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted, which may adversely impact our results from operations. \n\nWe may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands, or products. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products. \n\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, or improve our competitiveness. \n\nWe have implemented a number of initiatives, including development of an operations center and strategic long-term collaboration with suppliers, that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth. We have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational structure and operations to enable us to reduce costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. Our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost-saving initiatives. In addition, certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion, outsourcing, or distribution costs. We must accurately predict costs and be efficient in executing any plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, particularly in an environment of increased competition. To capitalize on our efforts, we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute in those areas with the most potential return on investment. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any cost-saving efforts, we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness, production, profitability, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected. \n\nBerkshire Hathaway has the ability to exert influence over us and significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 26.6% of our common stock. Three members of our Board are officers and/or directors of Berkshire Hathaway or its affiliates. As a result, Berkshire Hathaway has the potential to exercise influence over management and Board decisions, including those affecting our capital structure, such as the issuance of additional capital stock, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs, and the declaration and amount of dividends. Berkshire Hathaway also has influence over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock, including adopting any amendments to our charter, electing directors, and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or assets. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Berkshire Hathaway may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those opportunities may not be available to us. \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nOur level of indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our debt instruments, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. \n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness, including secured debt. Our existing debt, together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness, could have important consequences, including, but not limited to: \n\n&#8226; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; \n\n&#8226; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; \n\n&#8226; resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, including our commercial paper programs, liquidity, and access to capital markets; \n\n&#8226; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; \n\n&#8226; limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged; \n\n&#8226; making it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, payments of dividends, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; \n\n&#8226; exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency, as we earn profits in a variety of foreign currencies and the majority of our debt is denominated in U.S. dollars; and \n\n&#8226; in the case of any additional indebtedness, exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage. \n\nIn addition, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future debt or equity financings may not be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. \n\nOur debt instruments contain customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including a financial covenant in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Senior Credit Facility&#8221;) to maintain a minimum shareholders&#8217; equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)). The creditors who hold our debt could accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, such as our ability to timely prepare and file our periodic reports with the SEC, we have in the past needed and may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our debt instruments to avoid being in default. \n\nIf we breach any covenants under our debt instruments and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors, or we may not be able to remedy compliance within the terms of any waivers approved by the required creditors. If this occurs, we would be in default under our debt instruments and unable to access our Senior Credit Facility. In addition, certain creditors could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. \n\nAdditional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands . We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections, disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster, pandemic, or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, or changes in management strategy. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. \n\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. Our current expectations also include certain assumptions that could be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet our pricing expectations in relation to inflation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or inflation, change, or if management&#8217;s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future, which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth. Furthermore, changes in reporting units, including as a result of integrating a new acquisition into an existing reporting unit that has a fair value below carrying amount of goodwill, have led, and could in the future lead, to an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, any decisions to divest certain non-strategic assets has led, and could in the future lead, to goodwill or intangible asset impairments. \n\nReporting units and brands that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the annual impairment test we performed as of June 26, 2022 (the &#8220;Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test&#8221;) have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Reporting units with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount after impairment of $16.4 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Taste, Meals, and Away from Home (TMA), Canada and North America Coffee (CNAC), and Continental Europe. Reporting units with between 20-50% fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of $14.5 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Fresh, Beverages, and Desserts (FBD), Northern Europe, Asia, and Latin America (LATAM). Brands with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of $16.6 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Kraft , Oscar Mayer , Miracle Whip , Ore-Ida , Maxwell House , Cool Whip , Jet Puffed , and Plasmon . The aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 20-50% was $2.5 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test. Although the remaining brands, with a carrying value of $19.4 billion, have more than 50% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz Acquisition and the 2015 Merger and were initially recorded at the time of acquisition on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to impairments. \n\nOur net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international markets. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian dollar, euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Indonesian rupiah, Russian ruble, and New Zealand dollar. Since our consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period, which have been more volatile recently, will have an impact on our reported results. We have implemented foreign currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, these hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency. As a result, factors associated with our international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nCommodity, energy, and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results. \n\nWe purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, fiberboard, metals, and cardboard to package our products, and we use other inputs, such as electricity, natural gas, and water, to operate our facilities. We are also exposed to changes in oil prices, including diesel fuel, which influence both our packaging and transportation costs. Prices for commodities, energy, and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, inflationary pressure, foreign currency fluctuations, severe weather, natural disasters, global climate change, water risk, pandemics, crop failures, crop shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation, consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy, including increased demand for biofuels, and agricultural programs. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials, packaging, services, and transporting products, which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to changes in cross-currency transaction rates. In addition, disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have caused, and could continue to cause, increased volatility of commodity and energy costs. Rising commodity, energy, and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations, including the manufacture, transportation, and distribution of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nAlthough we monitor our exposure to commodity and other input prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs. For example, hedging our costs for one of our key commodities, dairy products, is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as liquid as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes, or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by competitive and consumer pressures. If we are not successful in our hedging activities, or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nIn 2022, we continued to experience higher commodity costs and supply chain costs, including procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs, largely due to inflationary pressures. We expect these costs to continue to increase and inflation to remain elevated through 2023. Although we take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation through pricing actions and efficiency gains, if these measures are not effective our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, we expect that there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred. Additionally, the pricing actions we take have, in some instances, negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our market share. \n\nVolatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income. \n\nWe use commodity futures, options, and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy products, vegetable oils, coffee beans, wheat products, corn products, sugar, meat products, and cocoa products. We recognize gains and losses based on changes in the values of these commodity derivatives. We recognize these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process. We recognize the unrealized gains and losses on these commodity derivatives in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment&#8217;s operating results. Accordingly, changes in the values of our commodity derivatives may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income. \n\nRegulatory Risks \n\nOur compliance with laws and regulations, and related legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions, could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation. \n\nAs a large, global food and beverage company, we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Various laws and regulations govern our practices including, but not limited to, those related to advertising and marketing, product claims and labeling, food production, environmental matters (including climate change), intellectual property, consumer protection and product liability, commercial disputes, trade and export controls, anti-trust, data privacy, labor and employment, workplace health and safety, and tax. As a consequence, we face a heightened risk of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed, and sold have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures, and higher production costs, adversely impacting our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, in response to pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), may result in investigations, legal claims, or litigation against us. In addition, claims about the health impacts of consumption of our products, or ingredients, components, or substances present or allegedly present in those products or packaging, have resulted in, and could in the future result in, us being subject to regulations, fines, lawsuits, or taxes that could adversely impact our business. \n\nAs a result of any such legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions, we could be subject to monetary judgments, settlements, and civil and criminal actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits, or activity restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We evaluate these legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and disclose relevant material litigation claims, legal proceedings, or regulatory enforcement actions as appropriate and in accordance with SEC rules and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). Our assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates. In addition, even if a claim is unsuccessful, without merit, or not pursued to completion, the cost of defending against or responding to such a claim, including expenses and management time, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results, which could negatively impact our business, investor confidence, and the price of our common stock. \n\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process, and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation, investigations, or penalties; negatively affect our liquidity, our access to capital markets, perceptions of our creditworthiness, our ability to complete acquisitions, our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports, or investor confidence in our financial reporting; or cause defaults, accelerations, or cross-accelerations under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements to the extent we are unable to obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or to cure any breaches, any of which may require management resources or cause our stock price to decline. \n\nA downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact interest costs or access to future borrowings. \n\nOur borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term credit ratings assigned by rating organizations. A decrease in these credit ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In February 2020, Moody&#8217;s Investor Services, Inc. (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) affirmed our long-term credit rating of Baa3 with a negative outlook and Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;) and S&#38;P Global Ratings (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) downgraded our long-term credit rating from BBB- to BB+ with a stable outlook from Fitch and a negative outlook from S&#38;P. The downgrades by Fitch and S&#38;P adversely affected our ability to access the commercial paper market. These downgrades did not constitute a default or event of default under our debt instruments. Our long-term credit rating was upgraded from BB+ to BBB- by S&#38;P in March 2022 and by Fitch in May 2022. Fitch upgraded our long-term debt credit rating from BBB- to BBB in November 2022. As of the date of this filing, our long-term debt is rated BBB- by S&#38;P, BBB by Fitch and Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s, with a positive outlook from S&#38;P and a stable outlook from Fitch and Moody&#8217;s. \n\nRegistered Securities Risks \n\nSales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall. \n\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including sales of our common stock by Berkshire Hathaway, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. A sustained depression in the market price of our common stock has happened and could in the future happen, which could also reduce our market capitalization below the book value of net assets, which could increase the likelihood of recognizing goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nKraft Heinz, 3G Global Food Holdings, and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the Securities Act all registrable shares held by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, which represents all shares of our common stock held by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital as of the date of the closing of the 2015 Merger. As of December 31, 2022, registrable shares represented approximately 34.5% of all outstanding shares of our common stock. Although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods, the registrable shares are not subject to a &#8220;lock-up&#8221; or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement. Accordingly, offers and sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement. Sales of our common stock by Berkshire Hathaway to other persons would likely result in an increase in the number of shares being traded in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. \n\nOur ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board and may be limited by our financial condition, debt agreements, or limitations under Delaware law. \n\nAlthough it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, any such determination to pay dividends and the amounts thereof will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, income, legal requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, debt agreements, and other factors the Board deems relevant. The Board has previously decided, and may in the future decide, in its sole discretion, to change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. For these reasons, stockholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment. Accordingly, realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur. \n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\nDisruptions in the global economy caused by geopolitical conflicts, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nEscalation of geopolitical tensions related to military conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand, increased cyberattacks, and impacts on foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we do not have operations in Ukraine, and our business in Russia generated approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused, and could continue to cause, negative impacts on our business and the global economy. Governments in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and European Union have each imposed export controls and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, we have experienced shortages in certain materials and increased costs in commodities including packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, energy, corn products, and wheat products. The effects of current geopolitical conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as potential future geopolitical tensions, could heighten many of our known risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors . \n\nUnanticipated business disruptions and natural events in the locations in which we or our customers, suppliers, distributors, or regulators operate could adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers or our results of operations. \n\nWe have a complex network of suppliers, owned and leased manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks, and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as weather or other geological events or natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, or wild fires (whether as a result of climate change or otherwise), raw material shortages, fires or explosions, political unrest, geopolitical conflicts (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), terrorism, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation, generalized labor unrest or labor shortages, or pandemics (including \n\nCOVID-19), could damage or disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, suppliers, vendors, co-manufacturers, distributors, or regulators. These factors include, but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; natural disasters, labor strikes, or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers&#8217; or distributors&#8217; facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products; and \n\n&#8226; illness of our workforce, or the workforce of third parties with which we do business, due to influenza or pandemics, could disrupt production of our products in one or more of our manufacturing facilities, or cause our suppliers, vendors, distributors, or third-party manufacturers to fail to meet their obligations to us. \n\nThese or other disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network. While we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks and have policies and procedures to manage business continuity planning, such insurance may not compensate us for any losses incurred and our business continuity plans may not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner. To the extent we are unable to respond to disruptions in our operations, whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations; to quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems; or to financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or effectively manage them if they occur, we may be late in delivering, or unable to deliver, products to our customers or to track orders, inventory, receivables, and payables. If that occurs, our customers&#8217; confidence in us and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nOur performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and in various other nations where we do business. \n\nOur performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the United States and in other nations where we do business. Economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets, changes to major international trade arrangements, and the imposition of tariffs by certain foreign governments could negatively impact our operations and sales. Other factors impacting our operations in the United States and in international locations where we do business include changes in laws, export and import restrictions, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency devaluation, cash repatriation restrictions, recessionary conditions, foreign ownership restrictions, nationalization, the impact of hyperinflationary environments, terrorist acts, political unrest, and military conflict. Such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions, and our responses to them, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel and may be unable to hire or retain key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. \n\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel and a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business. Unplanned turnover, failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing skills, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer position, could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Further, equity-based compensation is a key component of our compensation program and essential for attracting and retaining qualified personnel. As a result, the lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key personnel. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. Any such loss, failure, or limitation could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nWe are significantly dependent on information technology, and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security. \n\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, invasions, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events, or other factors. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, by unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors or by cyberattacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, reputational damage, transaction \n\nerrors, processing inefficiencies, the leakage of confidential information, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed. \n\nIn addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation or remediation costs, fines, or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, consumers, or suppliers. While we maintain a cyber insurance policy that provides coverage for security incidents, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on financially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. \n\nMisuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to our reputation and credibility, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands, and loss of our ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems. \n\nWe are also subject to various laws and regulations that are continuously evolving and developing regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. Such laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation and application, may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which can result in inconsistent or conflicting requirements. The European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), and similar regulations implemented in other non-U.S. geographies, adds a broad array of requirements with respect to personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes substantial penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) and the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which became effective in January 2023 and amended the CCPA, among other things, impose additional requirements with respect to disclosure and deletion of personal information of California residents. The CCPA and CPRA provide civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Similar legislation in Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, all of which have gone into effect or will go into effect during 2023, impose transparency and other obligations with respect to personal data of their respective residents and provide residents with similar rights. GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, and other privacy and data protection laws may increase our costs of compliance and risks of non-compliance, which could result in substantial penalties. \n\nOur results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses. \n\nInflationary pressures, shortages in the labor market, increased employee turnover, and changes in the availability of our workers could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the United States, Canada, and other foreign jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans, the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities and other investments. Additionally, the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. \n\nFurthermore, we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained agreements on satisfactory terms. Our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes or work stoppages or interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with union-represented employees both in and outside of the United States. \n\nWe continue to observe a competitive labor market. Employee turnover, changes in the availability of our workers, and labor shortages in our supply chain have resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased costs and have, and could again, impact our ability to meet consumer demand, both of which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nChanges in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business. \n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal, state, and local governments and administrative bodies within the United States, which represents the majority of our operations, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other regulatory reforms that may impact us. We continue to monitor the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and related regulatory developments to evaluate their potential impact on our business, tax rate, and financial results. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a global coalition of member countries, proposed a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation. The proposals aim to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries and impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax. It is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes, but these changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, financial condition, and business. \n\nSignificant judgment, knowledge, and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in geographic mix of income, changes in expenses not deductible for tax, including impairment of goodwill, and changes in available tax credits. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits, including transfer pricing matters, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for income taxes for the years 2018 and 2019. We have received a draft economist report and expect to receive a Notice of Proposed Adjustment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries asserting that our U.S. taxable income for 2018 and 2019 should have been higher, which would result in additional U.S. tax expense for 2018 and 2019 plus interest and potential penalties. We intend to vigorously contest the position taken by the IRS; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain, and if we are required to pay the IRS additional U.S. taxes, interest, and potential penalties, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made. \n\nVolatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business. \n\nChanges in financial and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. Additionally, some of our customers, suppliers, and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable, increasing our exposure to credit risk. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer, supplier, or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity. \n\n"

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\nOverview \n\nObjective: \n\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our objective is to also provide discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition and to offer information that provides an understanding of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nSee below for discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for a detailed discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nDescription of the Company: \n\nWe manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products throughout the world. \n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. \n\nSee Note 20, Segment Reporting , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for our financial information by segment. \n\nAcquisitions and Divestitures: \n\nIn 2022, we completed the acquisition of Companhia Hemmer Ind&#250;stria e Com&#233;rcio (the &#8220;Hemmer Acquisition&#8221;) and Just Spices GmbH (the &#8220;Just Spices Acquisition&#8221;), both of which are in our International segment. Additionally, in 2022, we completed the sale of our business-to-business powdered cheese business (the &#8220;Powdered Cheese Transaction&#8221;). The Powdered Cheese Transaction is not considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results; therefore, the results of this business are included in continuing operations through the date of sale. \n\nIn 2021, we completed the acquisition of Assan G&#305;da Sanayi ve Ticaret A.&#350;. (the &#8220;Assan Foods Acquisition&#8221;) and BR Spices Ind&#250;stria e Com&#233;rcio de Alimentos Ltda (the &#8220;BR Spices Acquisition&#8221;), both of which are in our International segment . Additionally, in 2021, we completed the sale of certain assets in our global nuts business (the &#8220;Nuts Transaction&#8221;) as well as the sale of certain assets in our global cheese businesses (the &#8220;Cheese Transaction&#8221;). The Nuts Transaction and the Cheese Transaction are not, individually or in the aggregate, considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results; therefore, the results of these businesses are included in continuing operations through the date of each sale in the prior year period. \n\nSee Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional information. \n\nConflict Between Russia and Ukraine: \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 1% of consolidated net sales, net income/(loss), and Adjusted EBITDA were generated from our business in Russia. For the year ended December 25, 2021, approximately 1% of consolidated net sales were generated from our business in Russia, while net income/(loss) and Adjusted EBITDA were each insignificant. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,100 employees in Russia. We have no operations or employees in Ukraine and insignificant net sales through distributors. Further, we have experienced cost increases globally for certain commodities, including packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, energy, corn products, and wheat products due to overall market demand, inflationary pressures, and, in part, to the negative impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the global economy. We will continue to monitor the impact that this conflict has on our business; however, through 2022, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nItems Affecting Comparability of Financial Results \n\nImpairment Losses: \n\nOur results of operations reflect goodwill impairment losses of $444 million, intangible asset impairment losses of $469 million, and property, plant, and equipment, net asset impairment losses of $86 million in 2022 compared to goodwill impairment losses of $318 million and intangible asset impairment losses of $1.3 billion in 2021. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , and Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional information on these impairment losses. \n\n53rd Week: \n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. Our 2022 fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 includes a 53rd week of activity. Our 2021 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 25, 2021. \n\nInflation and Supply Chain Impacts: \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued to experience increasing commodity costs and supply chain costs, including procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs, largely due to inflationary pressures, as compared to the prior year period. We expect these costs to continue to increase and inflation to remain elevated through 2023. While these costs have a negative impact on our results of operations, we are currently taking measures to mitigate, and expect to continue to take measures to mitigate, the impact of this inflation through pricing actions and efficiency gains. However, there has been, and we expect that there could continue to be, a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred. Additionally, the pricing actions we take have, in some instances, negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our market share. \n\nFurther, given the current level of demand for our products combined with industry-wide supply chain issues, we have experienced capacity constraints for certain products when demand has exceeded our current manufacturing capacity. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources , we continue to focus on rebuilding inventory and expanding capacity through increased capital investments, which have resulted in an increased ability to meet customer demand. However, these capacity constraints have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our market share, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, until we return to optimal service levels. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nWe disclose in this report certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. For additional information and reconciliations to the most closely comparable financial measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. \n\nConsolidated Results of Operations \n\nSummary of Results: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 % Change (in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 26,485 $ 26,042 1.7 % Operating income/(loss) 3,634 3,460 5.0 % Net income/(loss) 2,368 1,024 131.3 % Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders 2,363 1,012 133.4 % Diluted EPS 1.91 0.82 132.9 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Sales: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 % Change (in millions) Net sales $ 26,485 $ 26,042 1.7 % \n\nOrganic Net Sales (a) \n\n26,249 23,917 9.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) &#160; Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. \n\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021: \n\nNet sales increased 1.7% to $26.5 billion in 2022 compared to $26.0 billion in 2021, including the unfavorable impacts of acquisitions and divestitures (8.0 pp) and foreign currency (2.0 pp) and the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments (1.9 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 9.8% to $26.2 billion in 2022 compared to $23.9 billion in 2021, primarily driven by higher pricing (13.2 pp), which more than offset unfavorable volume/mix (3.4 pp). Pricing was higher in both segments, while volume/mix was unfavorable in both segments. \n\nNet Income/(Loss): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 % Change (in millions) Operating income/(loss) $ 3,634 $ 3,460 5.0 % Net income/(loss) 2,368 1,024 131.3 % Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders 2,363 1,012 133.4 % \n\nAdjusted EBITDA (a) \n\n6,003 6,371 (5.8) % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. \n\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021: \n\nOperating income/(loss) increased 5.0% to $3.6 billion in 2022 compared to $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily driven by higher pricing, lower non-cash impairment losses in the current year period, efficiency gains, and the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments, which more than offset higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs; higher commodity costs (mainly in dairy, packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, energy, and meat); the unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures; unfavorable volume/mix; and an accrual related to the previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit. \n\nNet income/(loss) increased 131.3% to $2.4 billion in 2022 compared to $1.0 billion in 2021. This increase was driven by lower interest expense, the operating income/(loss) factors discussed above, and lower tax expense, which more than offset unfavorable changes in other expense/(income). \n\n&#8226; Interest expense was $921 million in 2022 compared to $2.0 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a $38 million net gain on extinguishment of debt recognized in the current year period in connection with our debt repurchases in 2022 compared to a $917 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in the prior year period in connection with our tender offers, debt redemptions, and debt repurchases in 2021. The remaining change in interest expense was a decrease of approximately $171 million compared to the prior year period, as our aggregate principal amount of senior notes was reduced by approximately $6.2 billion in 2021 through tender offers, redemptions, repurchases, and repayments and approximately $1.5 billion in 2022 through repurchases and repayments. \n\n&#8226; Our effective tax rate was 20.2% in 2022 compared to 40.1% in 2021. Our 2022 effective tax rate was impacted by the favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain favorable items, primarily the decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the merger of certain foreign entities, the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws, and changes in estimates of certain 2021 U.S. income and deductions. This impact was partially offset by the impact of certain unfavorable items, primarily non-deductible goodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;), and the establishment of uncertain tax positions and valuation allowance reserves. Our 2021 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items, primarily the tax impacts related to acquisitions and divestitures, which mainly reflect the impacts of the Nuts Transaction and Cheese Transaction, partially offset by 2021 capital losses; the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in international and state tax rates, mainly an increase in U.K. tax rates; the impact of the federal tax on GILTI; and non-deductible goodwill impairments. These impacts were partially offset by a favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. \n\n&#8226; Other expense/(income) was $253 million of income in 2022 compared to $295 million of income in 2021. This change was primarily driven by a $79 million decrease in net pension and postretirement non-service benefits and a $25 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2022 compared to a $44 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2021. These impacts were partially offset by a $50 million net loss on derivative activities in 2022 compared to an $86 million net loss on derivative activities in 2021 and a $12 million increase in interest income as compared to the prior year period. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 5.8% to $6.0 billion in 2022 compared to $6.4 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs; higher commodity costs (mainly in dairy, packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, energy, and meat); the unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures (6.1 pp); unfavorable volume/mix; and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1.3 pp), which more than offset higher pricing, efficiency gains, and the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments (1.9 pp). \n\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 % Change (in millions, except per share data) Diluted EPS $ 1.91 $ 0.82 132.9 % \n\nAdjusted EPS (a) \n\n2.78 2.93 (5.1) % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) &#160; Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. \n\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021: \n\nDiluted EPS increased 132.9% to $1.91 in 2022 compared to $0.82 in 2021, primarily driven by the net income/(loss) factors discussed above. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 $ Change % Change Diluted EPS $ 1.91 $ 0.82 $ 1.09 132.9 % Restructuring activities 0.05 0.05 &#8212; Unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges 0.04 0.01 0.03 Impairment losses 0.70 1.07 (0.37) Certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters 0.13 0.05 0.08 Losses/(gains) on sale of business (0.01) 0.15 (0.16) Other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (0.02) &#8212; (0.02) Nonmonetary currency devaluation 0.01 &#8212; 0.01 Debt prepayment and extinguishment (benefit)/costs (0.03) 0.59 (0.62) Certain significant discrete income tax items \n\n&#8212; 0.19 (0.19) \n\nAdjusted EPS (b) \n\n$ 2.78 $ 2.93 $ (0.15) (5.1) % \n\nKey drivers of change in Adjusted EPS (a) : \n\nResults of operations $ 0.01 Results of divested operations (0.26) 53rd week 0.06 Interest expense 0.13 Other expense/(income) (0.03) Effective tax rate (0.06) $ (0.15) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. \n\nAdjusted EPS decreased 5.1% to $2.78 in 2022 compared to $2.93 in 2021 primarily due to lower Adjusted EBITDA, which includes the unfavorable impact of our divestitures, higher taxes on adjusted earnings, and unfavorable changes in other expense/(income), which more than offset lower interest expense, the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments, higher divestiture-related license income, and lower equity award compensation expense. \n\nResults of Operations by Segment \n\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales, Organic Net Sales, and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of divestiture-related license income (e.g., income related to the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction), restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment&#8217;s operating results), impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, and equity award compensation expense (excluding restructuring activities). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. \n\nUnder highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income, as nonmonetary currency devaluation, rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on our consolidated balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional information. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Venezuela, Argentina, and Turkey, which are all in our International segment. \n\nNet Sales: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (in millions) Net sales: North America $ 20,340 $ 20,351 International 6,145 5,691 Total net sales $ 26,485 $ 26,042 ##TABLE_END\n\nOrganic Net Sales: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Compared to 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (in millions) \n\nOrganic Net Sales (a) : \n\nNorth America $ 20,050 $ 18,361 International 6,199 5,556 Total Organic Net Sales $ 26,249 $ 23,917 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure.

See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. \n\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021: \n\nNet sales decreased 0.1% to $20.3 billion in 2022 compared to $20.4 billion in 2021, including the unfavorable impacts of divestitures (10.8 pp) and foreign currency (0.4 pp), partially offset by the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments (1.9 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 9.2% to $20.1 billion in 2022 compared to $18.4 billion in 2021, driven by higher pricing (13.0 pp), which more than offset unfavorable volume/mix (3.8 pp). Higher pricing was primarily driven by increases to mitigate rising input costs. Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to declines in frozen, meat, condiments and sauces, coffee, ready-to-drink beverages, and desserts. \n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.2% to $5.3 billion in 2022 compared to $5.6 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher commodity costs (mainly in dairy, packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, meat, and energy); higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs; the unfavorable impact of the Cheese Transaction and Nuts Transaction (6.7 pp); unfavorable volume/mix; and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.2 pp). These decreases to Segment Adjusted EBITDA more than offset higher pricing, efficiency gains, and the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments (1.9 pp). \n\nInternational: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Compared to 2021 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 % Change (in millions) Net sales $ 6,145 $ 5,691 8.0 % \n\nOrganic Net Sales (a) \n\n6,199 5,556 11.6 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA 1,017 1,066 (4.6) % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item. \n\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021: \n\nNet sales increased 8.0% to $6.1 billion in 2022 compared to $5.7 billion in 2021, including the favorable impacts of acquisitions and divestitures (2.8 pp) and a 53rd week of shipments (1.7 pp) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (8.1 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 11.6% to $6.2 billion in 2022 compared to $5.6 billion in 2021, driven by higher pricing (13.5 pp), which more than offset unfavorable volume/mix (1.9 pp). Higher pricing included increases across markets primarily to mitigate rising input costs. Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to declines across categories in Australia and New Zealand, declines in boxed dinners and condiments and sauces in the United Kingdom, and declines in condiments and sauces and infant nutrition in Russia, which more than offset higher foodservice sales across most markets and growth in Brazil. \n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.6% to $1.0 billion in 2022 compared to $1.1 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing costs; higher commodity costs, including in packaging and energy; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (7.2 pp); and unfavorable volume/mix, which more than offset higher pricing, efficiency gains, and the favorable impact of a 53rd week of shipments (1.6 pp). \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nWe believe that cash generated from our operating activities, commercial paper programs, and Senior Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, repayments of long-term debt, future contractual obligations, payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends, planned capital expenditures, restructuring expenditures, and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans for the next 12 months. An additional potential source of liquidity is access to capital markets. We intend to use our cash on hand and commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements. \n\nAcquisitions and Divestitures: \n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we closed the Just Spices Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $243 million. In the second quarter of 2022, we closed the Hemmer Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $279 million. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we received approximately $108 million of cash consideration following the closing of the Powdered Cheese Transaction. \n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we received approximately $3.4 billion of cash consideration following the closing of the Nuts Transaction. In connection with the Nuts Transaction, we paid approximately $700 million of cash taxes in the second half of 2021, primarily to U.S. federal and state tax authorities. We primarily utilized the post-tax transaction proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund opportunistic repayments of long-term debt, including our tender offers in the second quarter of 2021 and our debt redemption and open market debt repurchases in the third quarter of 2021. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we received approximately $3.2 billion of cash consideration following the closing of the Cheese Transaction. In connection with the Cheese Transaction, we paid approximately $620 million of cash taxes in the second quarter of 2022, primarily to U.S. federal and state tax authorities. We primarily utilized the post-tax transaction proceeds to fund our open market debt repurchases and tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2021. \n\nAdditionally, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the Assan Foods Acquisition, which included cash consideration of approximately $70 million, and the BR Spices Acquisition for an insignificant amount of cash consideration. \n\nSee Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional information on our acquisitions and divestitures. See Note 16, Debt , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional information on our debt transactions. \n\nCash Flow Activity for 2022 Compared to 2021: \n\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities: \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $5.4 billion for the year ended December 25, 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction in 2021, higher cash outflows for inventories, primarily related to stock rebuilding, increased input costs, and the acceleration of payments to suppliers attributed to the wind-down of our existing product financing arrangements, as well as lower Adjusted EBITDA. These impacts were partially offset by lower cash outflows for interest primarily due to the reduction of long-term debt throughout 2022 and 2021. \n\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities: \n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $4.0 billion for the year ended December 25, 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by proceeds from the Nuts Transaction and Cheese Transaction in 2021, as well as payments for the Just Spices Acquisition and Hemmer Acquisition in 2022. These impacts were partially offset by increased proceeds from the settlement of net investment hedges and proceeds from the Powdered Cheese Transaction in 2022. We had 2022 capital expenditures of $916 million compared to 2021 capital expenditures of $905 million. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion, primarily driven by capital investments for capacity expansion, maintenance, cost improvement and innovation projects, and technology. \n\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities: \n\nNet cash used for financing activities was $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $9.3 billion for the year ended December 25, 2021. This change was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt and debt prepayment and extinguishment costs in 2021 related to our tender offers, debt repurchases, and debt redemptions in 2021. See Note 16, Debt , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional information on our debt repayments. \n\nCash Held by International Subsidiaries: \n\nOf the $1.0 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022, $707 million was held by international subsidiaries. \n\nSubsequent to January 1, 2018, we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed, if repatriated, related to our 2018 through 2022 accumulated earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately $50 million. \n\nOur undistributed historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017 are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Related to these undistributed historic earnings, we had recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $10 million on approximately $90 million of historic earnings at December 31, 2022 and a deferred tax liability of approximately $10 million on approximately $135 million of historic earnings at December 25, 2021. The deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. \n\nTrade Payables Programs: \n\nIn order to manage our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 200 days. We also maintain agreements with third party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell one or more of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. We have no economic interest in a supplier&#8217;s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We estimate that the amounts outstanding under these programs were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and $820 million at December 25, 2021. \n\nProduct Financing Arrangements: \n\nWe enter into various product financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to wind-down our existing product financing arrangements, with final impacts of the wind-down expected to extend into 2023. We continue to have access to these programs to facilitate supply from our vendors in the future, if we choose to do so. See Note 14, Financing Arrangements , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional information on our product financing arrangements. \n\nBorrowing Arrangements: \n\nAs of the date of this filing, our long-term debt is rated BBB- by S&#38;P Global Ratings (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;), BBB by Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;) and Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investor Services, Inc. (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;), with a positive outlook from S&#38;P and a stable outlook from Fitch and Moody&#8217;s. In February 2020, Fitch and S&#38;P downgraded our long-term credit rating from BBB- to BB+. These downgrades adversely affected our ability to access the commercial paper market. These downgrades did not constitute a default or event of default under any of our debt instruments. Our ability to borrow under the Senior Credit Facility was not affected by the downgrades. Our long-term credit rating was upgraded from BB+ to BBB- by S&#38;P in March 2022 and by Fitch in May 2022. Fitch upgraded our long-term debt credit rating from BBB- to BBB in November 2022. \n\nFrom time to time, we obtain funding through our commercial paper programs. We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022, at December 25, 2021, or during the year ended December 25, 2021. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $198 million, under our U.S. commercial paper program. \n\nOur Senior Credit Facility provides for a revolving commitment of $4.0 billion through July 8, 2027. Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion. \n\nNo amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2022, our previous credit facility (the &#8220;Previous Senior Credit Facility&#8221;) at December 25, 2021, or on either the Senior Credit Facility or Previous Senior Credit Facility during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. \n\nOur credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, restrict our ability to access our Senior Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2022. \n\nLong-Term Debt: \n\nOur long-term debt, including the current portion, was $20.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and $21.8 billion at December 25, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to approximately $315 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes that were repaid at maturity in August 2022, approximately $381 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were repaid at maturity in June 2022, approximately $6 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were repaid at maturity in March 2022, and approximately $755 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased in connection with the debt repurchases in 2022, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign-denominated debt. We used cash on hand to fund our debt repurchases in 2022 and to pay related fees and expenses. \n\nWe have aggregate principal amounts of senior notes of approximately 750 million euros maturing in June 2023. \n\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, tender offers, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancing, exchange offers, open market or privately negotiated transactions, Rule 10b5-1 plans, or otherwise. \n\nOur long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2022. \n\nSee Note 16, Debt , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional information on our long-term debt activity. \n\nEquity and Dividends: \n\nWe paid dividends on our common stock of $2.0 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2023, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, which is payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2023. \n\nThe declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that our Board deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. \n\nAggregate Contractual Obligations: \n\nRelated to our current and long-term material cash requirements, the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations at December 31, 2022, which we expect to primarily fund with cash from operating activities (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Material Cash Requirements 2023 2024-2025 2026-2027 2028 and Thereafter Total \n\nLong-term debt (a) \n\n$ 1,690 $ 2,322 $ 5,319 $ 24,656 $ 33,987 \n\nFinance leases (b) \n\n30 34 19 68 151 \n\nOperating leases (c) \n\n150 223 160 292 825 \n\nPurchase obligations (d) \n\n487 766 297 261 1,811 \n\nOther long-term liabilities (e) \n\n57 142 38 135 372 Total $ 2,414 $ 3,487 $ 5,833 $ 25,412 $ 37,146 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt, including interest on long-term debt. \n\n(b) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our finance leases, including expected cash payments of interest expense. \n\n(c) Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases net of sublease income. \n\n(d) We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage, and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology, and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Several of these obligations are long-term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations. We do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations. \n\n(e) Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the one-time toll charge related to 2017 U.S. tax reform, as well as postretirement benefit commitments. Certain other long-term liabilities related to income taxes, insurance accruals, and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items. \n\nPension plan contributions were $11 million in 2022. We estimate that 2023 pension plan contributions will be approximately $11 million. Postretirement benefit plan contributions were $12 million in 2022. We estimate that 2023 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately $12 million. Estimated future contributions take into consideration current economic conditions, which at this time are expected to have minimal impact on expected contributions for 2023. Beyond 2023, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension or postretirement plans. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension or postretirement asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated pension and postretirement plan contributions for 2023 have been excluded from the above table. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $555 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur; therefore, we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table. \n\nSupplemental Guarantor Information: \n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company (as the &#8220;Parent Guarantor&#8221;) fully and unconditionally guarantees all the senior unsecured registered notes (collectively, the &#8220;KHFC Senior Notes&#8221;) issued by Kraft Heinz Foods Company (&#8220;KHFC&#8221;), our 100% owned operating subsidiary (the &#8220;Guarantee&#8221;). See Note 16, Debt , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for additional descriptions of these guarantees. \n\nThe payment of the principal, premium, and interest on the KHFC Senior Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Parent Guarantor, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable indenture. None of the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s subsidiaries guarantee the KHFC Senior Notes. \n\nThe Guarantee is the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s senior unsecured obligation and is: (i) pari passu in right of payment with all of the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s existing and future senior indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to all of the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s future subordinated indebtedness; (iii) effectively subordinated to all of the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets secured by that indebtedness; and (iv) effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s subsidiaries. \n\nThe KHFC Senior Notes are obligations exclusively of KHFC and the Parent Guarantor and not of any of the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s other subsidiaries. Substantially all of the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s operations are conducted through its subsidiaries. The Parent Guarantor&#8217;s other subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due under the KHFC \n\nSenior Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, or other payments. Except to the extent the Parent Guarantor is a creditor with recognized claims against its subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and holders of preferred stock, if any, of its subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries over its claims (and therefore the claims of its creditors, including holders of the KHFC Senior Notes). Consequently, the KHFC Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Parent Guarantor&#8217;s subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that it may in the future acquire or establish. The obligations of the Parent Guarantor will terminate and be of no further force or effect in the following circumstances: (i) (a) KHFC&#8217;s exercise of its legal defeasance option or, except in the case of a guarantee of any direct or indirect parent of KHFC, covenant defeasance option in accordance with the applicable indenture, or KHFC&#8217;s obligations under the applicable indenture have been discharged in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture or (b) as specified in a supplemental indenture to the applicable indenture; and (ii) the Parent Guarantor has delivered to the trustee an officer&#8217;s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the applicable indenture have been complied with. The Guarantee is limited by its terms to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. \n\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for the Parent Guarantor and KHFC (as subsidiary issuer of the KHFC Senior Notes) (together, the &#8220;Obligor Group&#8221;), on a combined basis after the elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions between the Parent Guarantor and subsidiary issuer and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor. \n\nSummarized Statement of Income \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Net sales $ 17,329 \n\nGross profit (a) \n\n5,775 Goodwill impairment losses &#8212; Intercompany service fees and other recharges 3,829 Operating income/(loss) 1,089 Equity in earnings/(losses) of subsidiaries 2,114 Net income/(loss) 2,363 Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders 2,363 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) In 2022, the Obligor Group recorded $398 million of net sales to the non-guarantor subsidiaries and $38 million of purchases from the non-guarantor subsidiaries. \n\nSummarized Balance Sheets \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 ASSETS Current assets $ 4,218 Current assets due from affiliates (a) \n\n1,788 Non-current assets 5,445 Goodwill 8,823 Intangible assets, net 2,102 Non-current assets due from affiliates (b) \n\n195 LIABILITIES Current liabilities $ 4,915 Current liabilities due to affiliates (a) \n\n1,791 Non-current liabilities 21,372 Non-current liabilities due to affiliates (b) \n\n591 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Represents receivables and short-term lending due from and payables and short-term lending due to non-guarantor subsidiaries. \n\n(b) Represents long-term lending due from and long-term borrowings due to non-guarantor subsidiaries. \n\nCommodity Trends \n\nWe purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, soybean and vegetable oils, tomatoes, coffee beans, sugar and other sweeteners, other fruits and vegetables, corn products, wheat products, and potatoes, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, fiberboard, metals, and cardboard to package our products, and we use electricity, diesel fuel, and natural gas in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced higher commodity costs primarily for dairy, packaging materials, soybean and vegetable oils, energy (including diesel fuel, electricity, and natural gas), and meat as compared to the prior year period. These increases were primarily driven by overall market demand, inflationary pressures, and, in part, by the negative impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the global economy. We anticipate commodity costs to continue to increase and inflation to remain elevated through 2023. We manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies. As a result of these risk management strategies, our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends. \n\nIn 2022, dairy commodities, primarily milk, cream, and cheese, were the most significant cost components of our cheese products. We purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties, such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. Market supply and demand, as well as government programs, significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products. Significant cost components of our meat products include pork, beef, and poultry, which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets. Livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for U.S. meats influence the prices of these meat products. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nNote 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. \n\nRevenue Recognition: \n\nOur revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year. \n\nAdvertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions: \n\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information. \n\nAdvertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. Our definition of advertising expenses includes advertising production costs, in-store advertising costs, agency fees, brand promotions and events, and sponsorships, in addition to costs to obtain advertising in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We recorded advertising expenses of $945 million in 2022, $1,039 million in 2021, and $1,070 million in 2020. We also incur market research costs, which are recorded in SG&#38;A but are excluded from advertising expenses. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets: \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. These seven reporting units had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of $30.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $38.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. \n\nWe test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections, disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster, pandemic, or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, or changes in management strategy. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for a discussion of the timing of the annual impairment test. \n\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. Our current expectations also include certain assumptions that could be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet our pricing expectations in relation to inflation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or inflation, change, or if management&#8217;s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future. Additionally, any decisions to divest certain non-strategic assets has led, and could in the future lead, to goodwill or intangible asset impairments. \n\nAs detailed in Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , we recorded impairment losses related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our reporting units and brands that were impaired were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates. Accordingly, these and other reporting units and brands that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. \n\nReporting units with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount after impairment of $16.4 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Taste, Meals, and Away from Home (TMA), Canada and North America Coffee (CNAC), and Continental Europe. Reporting units with between 20-50% fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of $14.5 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Fresh, Beverages, and Desserts (FBD), Northern Europe, Asia, and Latin America (LATAM). Our reporting units that have less than 1% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test are considered at a heightened risk of future impairments and include our CNAC and Continental Europe reporting units, which had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount after impairment of $2.4 billion. Our four remaining reporting units had no goodwill carrying amount at the time of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test. \n\nBrands with 20% or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of $16.6 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test and included Kraft , Oscar Mayer , Miracle Whip , Ore-Ida , Maxwell House , Cool Whip , Jet Puffed , and Plasmon . The aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 20-50% was $2.5 billion as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test. Although the remaining brands, with a carrying amount of $19.4 billion, have more than 50% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz Acquisition and the 2015 Merger and were initially recorded at the time of acquisition on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to impairments. Our brands that have less than 5% excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test are considered at a heightened risk of future impairments and include our Kraft , Ore-Ida , Jet Puffed , and Plasmon brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $11.3 billion. \n\nWe generally utilize the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit (including net sales, cost of products sold, SG&#38;A, depreciation and amortization, working capital, and capital expenditures), income tax rates, long-term growth rates, and a discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in each future cash flow stream. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management&#8217;s plans, and guideline companies. \n\nWe utilize the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of certain of our largest brands. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand (including net sales, cost of products sold, and SG&#38;A), contributory asset charges, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future earnings attributable to the brand, and management&#8217;s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management&#8217;s plans, and guideline companies. \n\nWe utilize the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our remaining brands. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net sales for each brand, royalty rates (as a percentage of net sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee), income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand, and management&#8217;s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management&#8217;s plans, and guideline companies. \n\nAs detailed in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , the Cheese Transaction closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. We received total consideration of approximately $3.3 billion, which included approximately $1.6 billion primarily attributed to the Kraft and Velveeta licenses that we granted to Lactalis and approximately $141 million attributed to the Cracker Barrel license that Lactalis granted to us, the amounts of which were based on the estimated fair values of the licensed portion of each brand as of the closing date of the Cheese Transaction. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, at the time the licensed rights were granted, we reassessed the remaining fair value of the retained portions of the Kraft and Velveeta brands and recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment loss related to the Kraft brand of approximately $1.24 billion, which was recognized in SG&#38;A. \n\nThe discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and our brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount, as well as the goodwill or brand carrying amounts, as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test for each reporting unit or brand, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Goodwill or Brand Carrying Amount (in billions) Discount Rate Long-Term Growth Rate Royalty Rate Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum Reporting units $ 16.4 7.0 % 8.0 % 1.5 % 2.0 % Brands (excess earnings method) 14.9 7.7 % 7.8 % 1.0 % 1.5 % Brands (relief from royalty method) 1.7 7.5 % 8.5 % 0.5 % 2.0 % 4.0 % 20.0 % ##TABLE_END\n\nAssumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date. Additionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation. However, as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur, as a sensitivity measure, we have presented the estimated effects of isolated changes in discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates on the fair values of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount. These estimated changes in fair value are not necessarily representative of the actual impairment that would be recorded in the event of a fair value decline. \n\nIf we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount, as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test for each of these reporting units and brands, these isolated changes, which are reasonably possible to occur, would have led to the following increase/(decrease) in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands (in billions): \n\n##TABLE_START Discount Rate Long-Term Growth Rate Royalty Rate 50-Basis-Point 25-Basis-Point 100-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Reporting units $ (2.8) $ 3.4 $ 1.4 $ (1.3) Brands (excess earnings method) (1.2) 1.4 0.5 (0.5) Brands (relief from royalty method) (0.1) 0.2 0.1 (0.1) $ 0.2 $ (0.2) ##TABLE_END\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. \n\nSee Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for our impairment testing results. \n\nPostemployment Benefit Plans: \n\nWe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach. The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan&#8217;s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive. \n\nFor our postretirement benefit plans, our 2023 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 6.6%. We established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 4.8%. The year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan, ranging between the years 2023 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. \n\nOur 2023 discount rate assumption will be 5.5% for service cost and 5.4% for interest cost for our postretirement plans. Our 2023 discount rate assumption will be 5.7% for service cost and 5.5% for interest cost for our U.S. pension plans and 5.3% for service cost and 5.0% for interest cost for our non-U.S. pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. \n\nOur 2023 expected return on plan assets will be 6.3% (net of applicable taxes) for our postretirement plans. Our 2023 expected rate of return on plan assets will be 6.6% for our U.S. pension plans and 5.1% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets&#8217; historical long-term investment performance, current and future asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by re-balancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments. \n\nWhile we do not anticipate further changes in the 2023 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans, as a sensitivity measure, a 100-basis-point change in our discount rate or a 100-basis-point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 100-Basis-Point 100-Basis-Point Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Effect of change in discount rate on pension costs $ 8 $ (11) $ (3) $ 4 Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs (30) 30 (17) 17 Effect of change in discount rate on postretirement costs &#8212; &#8212; (1) 1 Effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on postretirement costs (8) 8 &#8212; &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome Taxes: \n\nWe compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions. We recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50% probability of being realized upon settlement. We regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period. The annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits. When adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits, we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date, however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting. These unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease to income. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 3, New Accounting Standards , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. \n\nContingencies \n\nSee Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for a discussion of our contingencies. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted EPS, or other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. We believe that Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS provide important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess the Company&#8217;s operating performance on a consistent basis. \n\nManagement believes that presenting our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. \n\nOrganic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. We calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year&#8217;s exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which we calculate the previous year&#8217;s results using the current year&#8217;s exchange rate. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of divestiture-related license income (e.g., income related to the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction), restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, and equity award compensation expense (excluding restructuring activities). \n\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS excluding, when they occur, the impacts of restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), debt prepayment and extinguishment (benefit)/costs, and certain significant discrete income tax items (e.g., U.S. and non-U.S. tax reform), and including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. \n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company \n\nReconciliation of Net Sales to Organic Net Sales \n\n(dollars in millions) \n\n(Unaudited) \n\n##TABLE_START Net Sales Currency Acquisitions and Divestitures 53rd Week Organic Net Sales Price Volume/Mix 2022 North America $ 20,340 $ (67) $ &#8212;

Goodwill impairment losses of $444 million ($444 million after-tax) in 2022 and $318 million ($318 million after-tax) in 2021, which were recorded in SG&#38;A; \n\n&#8226; Intangible asset impairment losses of $469 million ($358 million after-tax) in 2022 and $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after-tax) in 2021, which were recorded in SG&#38;A; and \n\n&#8226; Property, plant and equipment asset impairment losses of $86 million ($65 million after-tax) in 2022, which were recorded in cost of products sold. \n\n(d) Gross expenses included in certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters were $210 million ($161 million after-tax) in 2022 and $62 million ($62 million after-tax) in 2021 and were recorded in SG&#38;A. The 2022 expenses relate to an accrual in connection with the previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit.

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n\nWe are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , and Note 12, Financial Instruments , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures. \n\nWhen we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. By policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. \n\nEffect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices: &#160; \n\nThe potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and cross-currency swap contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Commodity contracts $ 94 $ 56 Foreign currency contracts 71 130 Cross-currency swap contracts 211 318 ##TABLE_END\n\nIt should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayments and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Kraft Heinz Company \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Kraft Heinz Company and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments \n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s consolidated goodwill balance was $30.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. Historically, management tested reporting units for impairment annually as of the first day of the second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022 and for subsequent annual periods, management voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date to the first day of the third quarter. Reporting units are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. Management recognized non-cash goodwill impairment losses of $444 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management utilizes the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of reporting units. As disclosed by management, management&#8217;s cash flow projections included significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&#38;A), depreciation and amortization, working capital, capital expenditures, income tax rates, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and other market factors. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&#38;A, discount rates, and long-term growth rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Company&#8217;s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management&#8217;s process for developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the method; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&#38;A, discount rates and long-term growth rates. Evaluating management&#8217;s assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&#38;A, discount rates and long-term growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i) the Company&#8217;s discounted cash flow method and (ii) the discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions. \n\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments \n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s consolidated indefinite-lived intangible assets balance, which consists primarily of individual brands, was $38.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. Historically, management tested brands for impairment annually as of the first day of the second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a brand is less than its carrying amount. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022 and for subsequent annual periods, management voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date to the first day of the third quarter. Brands are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a brand exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount. Management recognized non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses of $462 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As disclosed by management, management utilizes either an excess earnings method or relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value of its brands. Using the excess earnings method, management&#8217;s cash flow projections included significant assumptions relating to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&#38;A, contributory asset charges, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, discount rates, and other market factors. Using the relief from royalty method, management&#8217;s cash flow projections included significant assumptions related to net sales, royalty rates, income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, discount rates, and other market factors. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the brands; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&#38;A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the relief from royalty method; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management&#8217;s process for developing the fair value of the brands; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the excess earnings and relief from royalty methods; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the methods; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&#38;A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the relief from royalty method. Evaluating management&#8217;s assumptions related to net sales, cost of products sold, SG&#38;A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the relief from royalty method involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the individual brands; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i) the Company&#8217;s excess earnings and relief from royalty methods and (ii) the royalty rate for the relief from royalty method and long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions for the excess earnings method and relief from royalty method. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nChicago, Illinois \n\nFebruary 16, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s or its predecessors' auditor since 1979. \n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company \n\nConsolidated Statements of Income \n\n(in millions, except per share data) \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Net sales $ 26,485 &#160;

Basis of Presentation \n\nOrganization \n\nOn July 2, 2015 (the &#8220;2015 Merger Date&#8221;), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (&#8220;Kraft&#8221;) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (&#8220;Heinz&#8221;) (the &#8220;2015 Merger&#8221;). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company. Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global Food Holdings, LP, following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013 (the &#8220;2013 Heinz Acquisition&#8221;). \n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to years and quarters contained herein pertain to our fiscal years and fiscal quarters. Our 2022 fiscal year was a 53-week period that ended on December 31, 2022, our 2021 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 25, 2021, and our 2020 fiscal year was a 52-week period that ended on December 26, 2020. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include The Kraft Heinz Company and all of our controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, reserves, and expenses. These accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections, estimates, and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections, estimates, and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Market volatility, including foreign currency exchange rates, increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nReclassifications \n\nWe made reclassifications and adjustments to certain previously reported financial information to conform to our current period presentation. \n\nHeld for Sale \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we classified certain assets as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily relating to land use rights across the globe. At December 25, 2021, we classified certain assets as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet, including inventory in our International segment and certain manufacturing equipment and land use rights across the globe. \n\nCash , Cash Equivalents , and Restricted Cash \n\nCash equivalents include term deposits with banks, money market funds, and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. The fair value of cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount. Cash and cash equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage are classified in other current assets or other non-current assets, as applicable, on the consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash recorded in other non-current assets was $ 1 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 1 million at December 25, 2021. Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $ 1,041 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 3,446 million at December 25, 2021. \n\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies \n\nRevenue Recognition: \n\nOur revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year. \n\nAdvertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions: \n\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization, redemption rates, and/or current period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information. \n\nAdvertising expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;). For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs. We then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. Our definition of advertising expenses includes advertising production costs, in-store advertising costs, agency fees, brand promotions and events, and sponsorships, in addition to costs to obtain advertising in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We recorded advertising expenses of $ 945 million in 2022, $ 1,039 million in 2021, and $ 1,070 million in 2020. We also incur market research costs, which are recorded in SG&#38;A but are excluded from advertising expenses. \n\nResearch and Development Expense: \n\nWe expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&#38;A. Research and development expenses were approximately $ 127 million in 2022, $ 140 million in 2021, and $ 119 million in 2020. \n\nStock-Based Compensation: \n\nWe recognize compensation costs related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award, which is generally three to five years , or on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the awards. These costs are primarily recognized within SG&#38;A. We estimate expected forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures as they occur in determining our equity award compensation costs. We classify equity award compensation costs primarily within general corporate expenses. See Note 10, Employees&#8217; Stock Incentive Plans , for additional information. \n\nPostemployment Benefit Plans: \n\nWe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits, and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income) in future periods using the corridor approach. The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan&#8217;s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive. See Note 11, Postemployment Benefits , for additional information. \n\nIncome Taxes: \n\nWe recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. \n\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect our results in the quarter of such change. \n\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position. \n\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends: \n\nDividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. \n\nInventories: \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment: \n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three years to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment if we have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time and it is feasible for us to either run the software on our own hardware or contract with a third party to host the software. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years . We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. \n\nHosted Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract: \n\nDeferred implementation costs for hosted cloud computing service arrangements are stated at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hosting arrangement that the implementation costs relate to. Deferred implementation costs to be amortized during the next 12 months for these arrangements are included in prepaid expenses and amortized to SG&#38;A. All remaining amounts to be amortized are included in other non-current assets. The corresponding cash flows related to these arrangements will be reported within operating activities. We review the deferred implementation costs for impairment when we believe the deferred costs may no longer be recoverable. Such conditions could include situations where the arrangement is not expected to provide substantive service potential, a significant change occurs in the manner in which the arrangement is used or expected to be used, including early cancellation or termination of the arrangement, or situations where the arrangement has had, or will have, a significant change made to it. In instances where we have concluded that an impairment exists, we accelerate the deferred costs on the consolidated balance sheet for immediate expense recognition in SG&#38;A. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets : \n\nWe maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands. We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections, disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster, pandemic, or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, or changes in management strategy. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , for a discussion of the timing of the annual impairment test. \n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. \n\nSee Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information. \n\nLeases: \n\nWe determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception based on the presence of identified assets and our right to obtain substantially all the economic benefit from and to direct the use of such assets. When we determine a lease exists, we record a right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date at the value of the lease liability and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the discount rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate (dependent on tenor and currency and adjusted to reflect collateralization) based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. \n\nWe do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nWe recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we recognize amortization expense over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the underlying assets or the lease term. In instances of title transfer, expense is recognized over the useful life. Interest expense on a finance lease is recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. \n\nWe have lease agreements with non-lease components that relate to the lease components (e.g., common area maintenance such as cleaning or landscaping, insurance, etc.). We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all costs associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease costs. \n\nCertain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance and tax payments. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability and are recognized as expense in the period in which the payment occurs. \n\nOur lease agreements do not include significant restrictions or covenants, and residual value guarantees are generally not included within our leases. \n\nFinancial Instruments: \n\nAs we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, and interest rate risks. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes. \n\nDerivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions. \n\nCertain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments and are marked to market through net income/(loss). The gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and are recognized in net income/(loss) at the time the hedged item affects net income/(loss), in the same line item as the underlying hedged item. The excluded component on cash flow hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship in the same income statement line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period using the spot method, with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The excluded component on derivatives designated as net investment hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) within interest expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. \n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. When a hedging instrument no longer meets the specified level of hedging effectiveness, we reclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income/(loss) within other expense/(income). We formally document our risk management objectives, our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in net income/(loss) in the current period. \n\nUnrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in cost of products sold and are included within general corporate expenses until realized. Once realized, the gains and losses are included within the applicable segment operating results. See Note 12, Financial Instruments , for additional information. \n\nOur designated and undesignated derivative contracts include: \n\n&#8226; Net investment hedges. We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries, the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments, including cross-currency swap contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. We exclude the interest accruals and any off-market values on cross-currency swap contracts and the forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness. We recognize the interest accruals and any amortization of off-market values on cross-currency swap contracts in net income/(loss) within interest expense. We amortize the forward points on foreign exchange contracts into net income/(loss) within interest expense over the life of the hedging relationship. \n\n&#8226; Foreign currency cash flow hedges. We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollar. These instruments include cross-currency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward and option contracts. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We exclude the interest accruals on cross-currency swap contracts (when interest is not a hedged item) and the forward points and option premiums or discounts on foreign exchange contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness and amortize such amounts into net income/(loss) in the same line item as the underlying hedged item over the life of the hedging relationship. \n\n&#8226; Interest rate cash flow hedges. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. We have primarily used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations. \n\n&#8226; Commodity derivatives. We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for dairy products, vegetable oils, coffee beans, wheat products, corn products, sugar, meat products, and cocoa products. These commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases and normal sales exception. We also use commodity futures, options, and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs, including the commodities noted above, as well as diesel fuel, packaging products, and natural gas. We do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments. We also occasionally use futures to economically cross hedge a commodity exposure. \n\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies: \n\nFor all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on our consolidated balance sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income/(loss) for the period. \n\nHighly Inflationary Accounting: \n\nWe apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%. Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income, rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on our consolidated balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates. We applied highly inflationary accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Turkey, Venezuela, and Argentina which resulted in insignificant nonmonetary currency devaluation losses in other expense/(income) in the periods presented. The net monetary assets of each of our subsidiaries in Turkey, Venezuela, and Argentina were insignificant at December 31, 2022. Our results of operations in Turkey, Venezuela, and Argentina reflect those of controlled subsidiaries. \n\nNote 3. New Accounting Standards \n\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted \n\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers: \n\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2021-08 to amend the accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805, Business Combinations . The guidance requires entities engaged in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets acquired and contract liabilities assumed in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , rather than at fair value on the acquisition date. The amendments also apply to other contracts such as contract liabilities arising from nonfinancial assets under ASC 610-20, Other Income &#8211; Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets . The ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2023. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period. We currently expect to adopt ASU 2021-08 in the first quarter of 2023 on a prospective basis. While the impact of these amendments is dependent on the nature of any future transactions, we currently do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nSupplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations: \n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04 to add disclosure requirements relative to supplier financing programs under ASC 405, Liabilities . The guidance requires entities that maintain supplier financing programs to provide information in their financial statements about their use of supplier finance programs and their effect on the entity&#8217;s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. Specifically, the amendment requires entities to disclose the key terms of their programs, amounts outstanding, balance sheet presentation, and a rollforward of amounts outstanding during the annual period. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period is required to be disclosed in interim periods. The ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward requirement, which is effective in fiscal year 2024. Early adoption is permitted. While we currently disclose the amounts outstanding on our existing trade payables programs, we are reviewing the provisions of this new pronouncement but do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nNote 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures \n\nAcquisitions \n\nHemmer Acquisition: \n\nOn March 31, 2022 (the &#8220;Hemmer Acquisition Date&#8221;), we acquired a majority of the outstanding equity interests of Companhia Hemmer Ind&#250;stria e Com&#233;rcio (&#8220;Hemmer&#8221;), a Brazilian food and beverage manufacturing company focused on the condiments and sauces category, from certain third-party shareholders (the &#8220;Hemmer Acquisition&#8221;). \n\nThe Hemmer Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total cash consideration related to the Hemmer Acquisition was approximately 1.3 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $ 279 million at the Hemmer Acquisition Date). A noncontrolling interest was recognized at fair value, which was determined to be the noncontrolling interest&#8217;s proportionate share of the acquiree&#8217;s identifiable net assets, as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date. As of the Hemmer Acquisition Date, we acquired 94 % of the outstanding shares of Hemmer. In the third quarter of 2022, we completed the redemption of the remaining outstanding shares and own 100 % of the controlling interest in Hemmer. \n\nWe entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the cash consideration for the Hemmer Acquisition. See Note 12, Financial Instruments , for additional information. \n\nWe utilized fair values at the Hemmer Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. \n\nThe fair value estimates of the assets acquired are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the Hemmer Acquisition Date). The primary areas of accounting for the Hemmer Acquisition that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible net assets acquired, residual goodwill, and any related tax impact. The fair values of these net assets acquired are based on management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While we believe that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we will evaluate any additional information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period, we will adjust preliminary valuations assigned to assets and liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date, that, if known, would have resulted in revised values for these items as of that date. The impact of all changes, if any, that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments will be included in current period earnings. \n\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Hemmer Acquisition was (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Initial Allocation (a) \n\nAdjustments Updated Allocation Cash $ 1 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1 &#160; Trade receivables 13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; Inventories 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; Other current assets 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; Identifiable intangible assets 122 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 122 &#160; Other non-current assets 13 &#160; 4 &#160; 17 &#160; Short-term debt ( 9 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 9 ) Trade payables ( 11 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 11 ) Other current liabilities ( 31 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 31 ) Long-term debt ( 11 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 11 ) Other non-current liabilities ( 44 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 44 ) Net assets acquired 76 &#160; 4 &#160; 80 &#160; Noncontrolling interest ( 16 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 16 ) Goodwill on acquisition 219 &#160; ( 4 ) 215 &#160; Total consideration $ 279 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 279 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) As reported in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 25, 2022. \n\nThe Hemmer Acquisition preliminarily resulted in $ 219 million of non-tax deductible goodwill relating principally to Hemmer&#8217;s long-term experience and large presence operating in emerging markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, a portion of the goodwill became tax deductible following the merger of Hemmer into our existing legal entity structure. This goodwill was assigned to the Latin America (&#8220;LATAM&#8221;) reporting unit within our International segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, certain insignificant measurement period adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the preliminary amount of goodwill was adjusted to $ 215 million. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information. \n\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Hemmer Acquisition was: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value (in millions of dollars) Weighted Average Life (in years) Definite-lived trademarks $ 101 &#160; 13 Customer-related assets 21 &#160; 15 Total $ 122 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe valued trademarks using the relief from royalty method and customer-related assets using the distributor method. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales, cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset&#8217;s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management&#8217;s plans, and market comparables. \n\nWe used carrying values as of the Hemmer Acquisition Date to value certain current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items at such date. \n\nJust Spices Acquisition: \n\nOn January 18, 2022 (the &#8220;Just Spices Acquisition Date&#8221;), we acquired 85 % of the shares of Just Spices GmbH (&#8220;Just Spices&#8221;), a German-based company focused on direct-to-consumer sales of premium spice blends, from certain third-party shareholders (the &#8220;Just Spices Acquisition&#8221;). \n\nThe Just Spices Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total cash consideration related to the Just Spices Acquisition was approximately 214 million euros (approximately $ 243 million at the Just Spices Acquisition Date). A noncontrolling interest was recognized at fair value, which was determined to be the noncontrolling interest&#8217;s proportionate share of the acquiree&#8217;s identifiable net assets, as of the Just Spices Acquisition Date. Under the terms of certain transaction agreements, Just Spices&#8217; other equity holders each have a put option to require us to purchase the remaining equity interests beginning three years after the Just Spices Acquisition Date. If the put option is not exercised, we have a call option to acquire the remaining equity interests of Just Spices. Considering the contractual terms related to the noncontrolling interest, it is classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet. \n\nSubsequent to the Just Spices Acquisition, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is measured at the greater of the amount that would be paid if settlement occurred as of the balance sheet date based on the contractually defined redemption value and its carrying amount adjusted for the net income/(loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. \n\nWe utilized fair values at the Just Spices Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation for the Just Spices Acquisition was final as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Just Spices Acquisition was (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Initial Allocation (a) \n\nAdjustments Final Allocation Cash $ 2 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2 &#160; Trade receivables 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Inventories 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; Other current assets 9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Identifiable intangible assets 172 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 172 &#160; Other non-current assets &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; 7 &#160; Trade payables ( 10 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 10 ) Other current liabilities ( 12 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 12 ) Other non-current liabilities ( 54 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 54 ) Net assets acquired 119 &#160; 7 &#160; 126 &#160; Redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 43 ) 4 &#160; ( 39 ) Goodwill on acquisition 167 &#160; ( 11 ) 156 &#160; Total consideration $ 243 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 243 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) As reported in Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to our condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 26, 2022. \n\nThe Just Spices Acquisition preliminarily resulted in $ 167 million of non-tax deductible goodwill relating principally to Just Spices&#8217; social media presence. This goodwill was assigned to the Continental Europe reporting unit within our International segment. In the second quarter of 2022, certain insignificant measurement period adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the preliminary amount of goodwill was adjusted to $ 163 million. We did not record any measurement period adjustments in the third quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, additional insignificant measurement period adjustments were made to the initial allocation, and the final amount of goodwill was adjusted to $ 156 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we finalized the purchase accounting for the Just Spices Acquisition. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information. \n\nThe purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Just Spices Acquisition was: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value (in millions of dollars) Weighted Average Life (in years) Definite-lived trademarks $ 72 &#160; 10 Customer-related assets 100 &#160; 15 Total $ 172 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe valued trademarks using the relief from royalty method and customer-related assets using the distributor method. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales, cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset&#8217;s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management&#8217;s plans, and market comparables. \n\nWe used carrying values as of the Just Spices Acquisition Date to value certain current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items at such date. \n\nAssan Foods Acquisition: \n\nOn October 1, 2021 (the &#8220;Assan Foods Acquisition Date&#8221;), we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Assan G&#305;da Sanayi ve Ticaret A.&#350;. (&#8220;Assan Foods&#8221;), a condiments and sauces manufacturer based in Turkey, from third parties Kibar Holding Anonim &#350;irketi and a holder of registered shares of Assan Foods (the &#8220;Assan Foods Acquisition&#8221;). \n\nThe Assan Foods Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Total consideration related to the Assan Foods Acquisition was approximately $ 79 million, including cash consideration of $ 70 million and contingent consideration of approximately $ 9 million. We utilized fair values at the Assan Foods Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation for the Assan Foods Acquisition was final as of September 24, 2022. \n\nThe final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Assan Foods Acquisition was (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Final Allocation Cash $ 4 &#160; Trade receivables 24 &#160; Inventories 26 &#160; Other current assets 2 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net 12 &#160; Identifiable intangible assets 16 &#160; Other non-current assets 5 &#160; Short-term debt ( 21 ) Current portion of long-term debt ( 5 ) Trade payables ( 25 ) Other current liabilities ( 2 ) Long-term debt ( 4 ) Other non-current liabilities ( 4 ) Net assets acquired 28 &#160; Goodwill on acquisition 51 &#160; Total consideration $ 79 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Assan Foods Acquisition preliminarily resulted in $ 64 million of non-tax deductible goodwill relating principally to additional capacity that the Assan Foods manufacturing facilities will provide for our brands in the EMEA East region. This goodwill was assigned to the EMEA East reporting unit within our International segment. Following the measurement period adjustments made in the first quarter of 2022, the preliminary amount of goodwill was adjusted to $ 51 million as of March 26, 2022. In the second and third quarters of 2022, we did not record any measurement period adjustments. In the third quarter of 2022, we finalized the purchase accounting for the Assan Foods Acquisition. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information. \n\nThe purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Assan Foods Acquisition was: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value (in millions of dollars) Weighted Average Life (in years) Definite-lived trademarks $ 13 &#160; 10 Customer-related assets 3 &#160; 10 Total 16 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe valued trademarks using the relief from royalty method and customer-related assets using the distributor method. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales, cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset&#8217;s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management&#8217;s plans, and market comparables. \n\nWe used carrying values as of the Assan Foods Acquisition Date to value certain current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items at such date. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we extinguished approximately $ 29 million of the short- and long-term debt assumed as a part of the Assan Foods Acquisition, resulting in approximately $ 1 million of long-term debt remaining related to the Assan Foods Acquisition at December 25, 2021. The loss on extinguishment related to the repayment of this debt was insignificant. Cash payments related to debt extinguishment are classified as cash outflows from financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nOther Acquisitions: \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired a majority stake in BR Spices Ind&#250;stria e Com&#233;rcio de Alimentos Ltda. (&#8220;BR Spices&#8221;), a manufacturer of spices and other seasonings in Brazil, for an insignificant amount of cash consideration (the &#8220;BR Spices Acquisition&#8221;). The noncontrolling interest associated with BR Spices is included in redeemable noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. \n\nDeal Costs: \n\nRelated to our acquisitions, we incurred insignificant deal costs in 2022 and 2021. We recognized these deal costs in SG&#38;A. There were no deal costs related to acquisitions in 2020. \n\nDivestitures \n\nPowdered Cheese Transaction: \n\nIn August 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, Kerry Group, to sell our business-to-business powdered cheese business (the &#8220;Powdered Cheese Transaction&#8221;). The net assets transferred in the Powdered Cheese Transaction include, among other things, the Albany, Minnesota manufacturing facility (collectively, the &#8220;Powdered Cheese Disposal Group&#8221;). \n\nThe Powdered Cheese Transaction closed in the fourth quarter of 2022 for total consideration of approximately $ 108 million. As a result of the Powered Cheese Transaction closing, we recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of business of approximately $ 26 million. \n\nCheese Transaction: \n\nIn September 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis (&#8220;Lactalis&#8221;), to sell certain assets in our global cheese business, as well as to license certain trademarks, for total consideration of approximately $ 3.3 billion, including approximately $ 3.2 billion of cash consideration and approximately $ 141 million related to a perpetual license for the Cracker Barrel brand that Lactalis granted to us for certain products (the &#8220;Cheese Transaction&#8221;). The Cheese Transaction had two primary components. The first component related to the perpetual licenses for the Kraft and Velveeta brands that we granted to Lactalis for certain cheese products (the &#8220; Kraft and Velveeta Licenses&#8221;), along with a three-year transitional license that we granted to Lactalis for the Philadelphia brand (the &#8220; Philadelphia License&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Cheese Divestiture Licenses&#8221;). The second component related to the net assets transferred to Lactalis (the &#8220;Cheese Disposal Group&#8221;). The Cheese Transaction closed on November 29, 2021 (the &#8220;Cheese Transaction Closing Date&#8221;). \n\nOf the $ 3.3 billion total consideration, approximately $ 1.6 billion was attributed to the Cheese Divestiture Licenses based on the estimated fair value of the licensed portion of each brand. As of the Cheese Transaction Closing Date, the license income related to the Kraft and Velveeta Licenses will be recognized over approximately 30 years and the license income related to the Philadelphia License will be recognized over approximately three years . Related to the Cheese Divestiture Licenses, we recognized approximately $ 56 million of license income in 2022 and an insignificant amount of license income in 2021, which was recorded as a reduction to SG&#38;A and classified as divestiture-related license income. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we have recorded approximately $ 1.5 billion in long-term deferred income and $ 56 million in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet related to the Cheese Divestiture Licenses. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we reimbursed Lactalis approximately $ 20 million following a final inventory count performed after the Cheese Transaction closed. This amount reflects the difference between the estimated and actual value of inventory transferred, which was primarily driven by seasonal fluctuations in finished goods. The payment to Lactalis was recognized in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a cash outflow from investing activities in proceeds from sale of business, net of cash disposed and working capital adjustments. \n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we assessed the fair value less costs to sell of the net assets of the Cheese Disposal Group and recorded an estimated pre-tax loss on sale of business of approximately $ 27 million, which was recognized in other expense/(income). \n\nFollowing the closing of the Cheese Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an incremental pre-tax gain on sale of business of $ 27 million in other expense/(income). In 2021, the total gain/loss on sale of business related to the Cheese Transaction was insignificant. Additional considerations related to the Cheese Transaction included the treatment of the Cheese Divestiture Licenses upon closing of the transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2021, at the time the licensed rights were granted, we reassessed the remaining fair value of the retained portions of the Kraft and Velveeta brands and recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment loss related to the Kraft brand of approximately $ 1.24 billion, which was recognized in SG&#38;A. \n\nSee Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information related to the Cheese Transaction. \n\nNuts Transaction: \n\nIn February 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party, Hormel Foods Corporation, to sell certain assets in our global nuts business for total consideration of approximately $ 3.4 billion (the &#8220;Nuts Transaction&#8221;). The net assets transferred in the Nuts Transaction included, among other things, our intellectual property rights to the Planters brand and to the Corn Nuts brand, three manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the associated inventories (collectively, the &#8220;Nuts Disposal Group&#8221;). \n\nAs of February 10, 2021, the date the Nuts Disposal Group was determined to be held for sale, we tested the individual assets included within the Nuts Disposal Group for impairment. The net assets of the Nuts Disposal Group had an aggregate carrying amount above their $ 3.4 billion estimated fair value. We determined that the goodwill within the Nuts Disposal Group was partially impaired. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $ 230 million, which was recognized in SG&#38;A, in the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, we recorded an estimated pre-tax loss on sale of business of $ 19 million in the first quarter of 2021 primarily related to estimated costs to sell, which was recognized in other expense/(income). \n\nThe Nuts Transaction closed in the second quarter of 2021. As a result of the Nuts Transaction closing, we recognized an incremental pre-tax loss on sale of business of $ 17 million in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income in the second quarter of 2021. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we recorded insignificant adjustments to our estimated costs to sell, which resulted in an insignificant pre-tax gain on sale of business that was recognized in other expense/(income). In 2021, the total pre-tax loss on sale of business for the Nuts Transaction was $ 34 million, all of which was recognized in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income. \n\nSee Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information related to the Nuts Transaction. \n\nDeal Costs: \n\nRelated to our divestitures, we incurred insignificant deal costs in 2022, 2021, and 2020. We recognized these deal costs in SG&#38;A. \n\nNote 5. Restructuring Activities \n\nAs part of our restructuring activities, we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance, non-cash severance, and pension and other termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur expenses that are an integral component of, and directly attributable to, our restructuring activities, which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include asset-related costs and other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges. Other implementation costs primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities, professional fees, asset relocation costs, costs to exit facilities, and costs associated with restructuring benefit plans. \n\nEmployee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements, local statutory requirements, and historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable; additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee&#8217;s required future service period. Charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service, in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale, and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair value. All other costs are recognized as incurred. \n\nRestructuring Activities: \n\nWe have restructuring programs globally, which are focused primarily on reducing our overall cost structure and streamlining our organizational design. In 2022, we eliminated approximately 575 positions related to these programs. As of December 31, 2022, we expect to eliminate approximately 560 additional positions in 2023, primarily outside of the United States and Canada. In 2022, restructuring activities resulted in expenses of $ 74 million and included $ 34 million of severance and employee benefit costs, $ 12 million of asset-related costs, and $ 28 million of other implementation costs. Restructuring activities resulted in expenses of $ 84 million in 2021 and income of $ 2 million in 2020. \n\nOur net liability balance for restructuring project costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP was (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Severance and Employee Benefit Costs Other Exit Costs Total Balance at December 25, 2021 $ 27 &#160; $ 16 &#160; $ 43 &#160; Charges/(credits) 34 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 34 &#160; Cash payments ( 33 ) ( 5 ) ( 38 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 28 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 39 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe expect the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 31, 2022 to be paid by the end of 2023. The liability for other exit costs primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire between 2023 and 2026. \n\nTotal Expenses/(Income): \n\nTotal expense/(income) related to restructuring activities by income statement caption, were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Severance and employee benefit costs - Cost of products sold $ 1 &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Severance and employee benefit costs - SG&#38;A 33 &#160; 21 &#160; 1 &#160; Severance and employee benefit costs - Other expense/(income) &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Asset-related costs - Cost of products sold 12 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; Other costs - Cost of products sold 14 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 33 ) Other costs - SG&#38;A 14 &#160; 49 &#160; 34 &#160; Other costs - Other expense/(income) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 17 ) $ 74 &#160; $ 84 &#160; $ ( 2 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nWe do not include our restructuring activities within Segment Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Note 20, Segment Reporting ). The pre-tax impact of allocating such expenses/(income) to our segments would have been (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 North America $ 40 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 4 &#160; International 25 &#160; 22 &#160; ( 15 ) General corporate expenses 9 &#160; 47 &#160; 9 &#160; $ 74 &#160; $ 84 &#160; $ ( 2 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nNote 6. Inventories \n\nInventories consisted of the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Packaging and ingredients $ 1,032 &#160; $ 571 &#160; Spare parts 208 &#160; 208 &#160; Work in process 334 &#160; 268 &#160; Finished product 2,077 &#160; 1,682 &#160; Inventories $ 3,651 &#160; $ 2,729 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 25, 2021, inventories excluded amounts classified as held for sale. \n\nNote 7. Property, Plant and Equipment \n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Land $ 200 &#160; $ 207 &#160; Buildings and improvements 2,536 &#160; 2,508 &#160; Equipment, software and other 7,055 &#160; 6,957 &#160; Construction in progress 1,161 &#160; 1,002 &#160; 10,952 &#160; 10,674 &#160; Accumulated depreciation ( 4,212 ) ( 3,868 ) Property, plant and equipment, net $ 6,740 &#160; $ 6,806 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, property, plant and equipment, net, excluded amounts classified as held for sale. Depreciation expense was $ 672 million in 2022, $ 671 million in 2021, and $ 705 million in 2020. \n\nNote 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nHistorically, we have tested our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. As discussed in further detail below, we performed an annual test as of March 27, 2022, the first day of our second quarter (the &#8220;Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test&#8221;). Beginning in the third quarter of 2022 and for subsequent annual periods, we voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date to the first day of our third quarter and performed an additional annual impairment test as of June 26, 2022 (the &#8220;Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test&#8221;). We believe this measurement date, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, better aligns with the timing of our strategic business planning process and financial forecasts, which are key components of the annual impairment tests and are typically completed in the third quarter of our fiscal year. \n\nGoodwill: \n\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill, by segment, were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START North America International Total Balance at December 26, 2020 $ 29,929 &#160; $ 3,160 &#160; $ 33,089 &#160; Impairment losses ( 35 ) ( 53 ) ( 88 ) Acquisitions &#8212; &#160; 74 &#160; 74 &#160; Divestitures ( 1,662 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 1,662 ) Translation adjustments and other 10 &#160; ( 127 ) ( 117 ) Balance at December 25, 2021 $ 28,242 &#160; $ 3,054 &#160; $ 31,296 &#160; Impairment losses ( 455 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 455 ) Acquisitions &#8212; &#160; 386 &#160; 386 &#160; Measurement period adjustments &#8212; &#160; ( 18 ) ( 18 ) Divestitures ( 37 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 37 ) Translation adjustments and other ( 65 ) ( 274 ) ( 339 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 27,685 &#160; $ 3,148 &#160; $ 30,833 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we closed the Just Spices Acquisition in our International segment, which resulted in preliminary goodwill of $ 167 million. Additionally, we recorded measurement period adjustments, primarily related to the Assan Foods Acquisition that impacted goodwill. The Assan Foods Acquisition closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is in our International segment. These measurement period adjustments resulted in a net decrease to goodwill on acquisitions of approximately $ 15 million in the first quarter of 2022. However, as each of the affected reporting units (EMEA East and LATAM in our International segment) had no goodwill balance remaining, we recorded a reduction of the $ 53 million non-cash impairment loss recorded to SG&#38;A in the fourth quarter of 2021 that fully impaired the goodwill related to the associated acquisitions and their respective reporting units. The impairment reduction of $ 11 million, which reflects the measurement period adjustment of $ 15 million adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, was recorded in SG&#38;A in our International segment in the first quarter of 2022. Following these measurement period adjustments, there was no goodwill in the EMEA East or Latin America reporting units. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information related to the impairment losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , for additional information related to these transactions and the related financial statement impacts. \n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we closed the Hemmer Acquisition in our International segment, which resulted in preliminary goodwill of $ 219 million . Additionally, we recorded insignificant measurement period adjustments related to the Just Spices Acquisition that impacted goodwill. These measurement period adjustments resulted in a decrease to goodwill on acquisitions of approximately $ 4 million in the second quarter of 2022. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we divested goodwill of approximately $ 37 million related to the Powdered Cheese Transaction. Additionally, we recorded measurement period adjustments related to the Just Spices Acquisition and Hemmer Acquisition that impacted goodwill. These measurement period adjustments were recorded in our International segment and resulted in a decrease to goodwill on acquisition of approximately $ 11 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\nAt December 26, 2020, goodwill excluded amounts classified as held for sale related to the Cheese Transaction, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the 2021 amounts included in divestitures in the table above represent the goodwill that was previously reclassified to assets held for sale and tested and determined to be partially impaired in connection with the Nuts Transaction. The resulting impairment loss of $ 230 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2021. The Nuts Transaction closed in the second quarter of 2021. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , for additional information related to the Cheese Transaction and the Nuts Transaction and their financial statement impacts. \n\n2022 Goodwill Impairment Testing \n\nAs described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation , in the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North America zone. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. \n\nThe reorganization of our internal reporting and reportable segments changed the composition of certain of our reporting units wherein certain of our existing United States reporting units (primarily Enhancers, Specialty, and Away From Home (&#8220;ESA&#8221;); Kids, Snacks, and Beverages (&#8220;KSB&#8221;); Meal Foundations and Coffee (&#8220;MFC&#8221;); and Puerto Rico) and our existing Canada reporting units (Canada Retail and Canada Foodservice) have been reorganized into the following new North America reporting units: Taste, Meals, and Away From Home (&#8220;TMA&#8221;); Fresh, Beverages, and Desserts (&#8220;FBD&#8221;); Canada and North America Coffee (&#8220;CNAC&#8221;); and Other North America. \n\nAs a result of this reorganization, we reassigned assets and liabilities to the applicable reporting units and allocated goodwill using the relative fair value approach. We performed an interim impairment test (or transition test) on the affected reporting units on both a pre- and post-reorganization basis. \n\nWe performed our pre-reorganization impairment test as of March 27, 2022, which was our first day of the second quarter of 2022. There were six reporting units affected by the reassignment of assets and liabilities that maintained a goodwill balance as of our pre-reorganization impairment test date. These reporting units were ESA, KSB, MFC, Puerto Rico, Canada Retail, and Canada Foodservice. One other reporting unit did not have a goodwill balance as of our pre-reorganization impairment test date. \n\nAs part of our pre-reorganization impairment test, we utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair values as of March 27, 2022 for the six reporting units noted above. As a result of our pre-reorganization impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $ 235 million in SG&#38;A in our North America segment in the second quarter of 2022. This included a $ 221 million impairment loss related to our Canada Retail reporting unit, which had a goodwill carrying amount of approximately $ 1.2 billion after impairment, and a $ 14 million impairment loss related to our Puerto Rico reporting unit, which represented all of the goodwill associated with the Puerto Rico reporting unit. The impairment of our Canada Retail reporting unit was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate, which was impacted by higher interest rates and other market inputs, as well as a revised downward outlook for operating margin. The impairment of our Puerto Rico reporting unit was primarily driven by a revised downward outlook for operating margin. The other four reporting units for which no impairment charge was required were as follows: ESA, which had a goodwill carrying amount of approximately $ 11.4 billion; KSB, which had a goodwill carrying amount of approximately $ 9.3 billion; MFC, which had a goodwill carrying amount of approximately $ 6.0 billion; and Canada Foodservice, which had a goodwill carrying amount of approximately $ 158 million. \n\nWe performed our post-reorganization impairment test in conjunction with our Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test and tested the new North America reporting units (TMA, FBD, CNAC, and Other North America) along with the reporting units in our International segment. The new North America reporting units&#8217; goodwill carrying amounts for the post-reorganization and Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test reflected the pre-reorganization test results, including impairments recorded. We tested our reporting units for impairment as of the first day of our second quarter, which was March 27, 2022 for our Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test. In performing this test, we incorporated information that was known through the date of filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 25, 2022. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units tested was in excess of its carrying amount. \n\nWe performed our Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test as of June 26, 2022, which was our first day of the third quarter of 2022. In performing this test, we incorporated information that was known through the date of filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 24, 2022. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $ 220 million in SG&#38;A in our North America segment related to our CNAC reporting unit. The impairment of our CNAC reporting unit was primarily driven by reduced revenue growth assumptions and negative macroeconomic factors, including increased interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we maintain 11 reporting units, seven of which comprise our goodwill balance. These seven reporting units had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of $ 30.8 billion at December 31, 2022. As of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, our reporting units with 20 % or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount after impairment of $ 16.4 billion and included TMA, CNAC, and Continental Europe; and our reporting units with between 20 %- 50 % fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of $ 14.5 billion and included FBD, Northern Europe, Asia, and LATAM. \n\nAccumulated impairment losses to goodwill were $ 11.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 10.9 billion at December 25, 2021. \n\n2021 Goodwill Impairment Testing \n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we announced the Nuts Transaction and determined that the Nuts Disposal Group was held for sale. Accordingly, based on a relative fair value allocation, we reclassified $ 1.7 billion of goodwill to assets held for sale, which included a portion of goodwill from four of our reporting units. The Nuts Transaction primarily affected our KSB reporting unit but also affected, to a lesser extent, our ESA, Canada Foodservice, and Puerto Rico reporting units. These reporting units were evaluated for impairment prior to their representative inclusion in the Nuts Disposal Group as well as on a post-reclassification basis. The fair value of all reporting units was determined to be in excess of their carrying amounts in both scenarios and, therefore, no impairment was recorded. \n\nWe performed our 2021 annual impairment test as of March 28, 2021, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2021. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our 2021 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $ 35 million in SG&#38;A in the second quarter of 2021 related to our Puerto Rico reporting unit within our North America segment. With the update of our five-year operating plan in the second quarter of 2021, we established a revised downward outlook for net sales for this reporting unit. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information on this impairment loss. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the Assan Foods Acquisition and the BR Spices Acquisition, both in our International segment. We assigned the goodwill related to the Assan Foods Acquisition to our EMEA East reporting unit and the goodwill related to the BR Spices Acquisition to our LATAM reporting unit. Prior to these acquisitions, the EMEA East and LATAM reporting units had no goodwill carrying amounts due to previous impairments. The acquisitions changed the composition of each of the reporting units, triggering an interim impairment test. We determined that the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of December 25, 2021. As a result, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 53 million in SG&#38;A in our International segment, which represented all of the goodwill of the EMEA East and LATAM reporting units. \n\n2020 Goodwill Impairment Testing \n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, following changes to our internal reporting and reportable segments, the composition of certain of our reporting units changed, and we performed an interim impairment test (or transition test) on the affected reporting units on both a pre- and post-reorganization basis. \n\nWe performed our pre-reorganization impairment test as of December 29, 2019, which was our first day of 2020. There were no impairment losses resulting from our pre-reorganization impairment test. \n\nWe performed our post-reorganization impairment test as of December 29, 2019. There were six reporting units in scope for our post-reorganization impairment test: Northern Europe, Continental Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (&#8220;ANJ&#8221;), LATAM, and Puerto Rico. As a result of our post-reorganization impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 226 million in SG&#38;A in the first quarter of 2020 related to two reporting units contained within our International segment, including $ 83 million related to our ANJ reporting unit and $ 143 million related to our LATAM reporting unit, which represented all of the goodwill associated with these reporting units. The remaining reporting units tested as part of our post-reorganization impairment test each had excess fair value over carrying amount as of December 29, 2019. \n\nWe performed our 2020 annual impairment test as of March 29, 2020, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2020. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Through the performance of the 2020 annual impairment test, we identified impairments related to our U.S. Foodservice, Canada Retail, Canada Foodservice, and EMEA East reporting units. As a result, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 1.8 billion in SG&#38;A in the second quarter of 2020, which included an $ 815 million impairment loss in our Canada Retail reporting unit within our North America segment, a $ 655 million impairment loss in our U.S. Foodservice reporting unit within our North America segment, a $ 205 million impairment loss in our Canada Foodservice reporting unit within our North America segment, and a $ 142 million impairment loss in our EMEA East reporting unit within our International segment. These impairments were primarily due to the completion of our enterprise strategy and five-year operating plan in the second quarter of 2020. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, following changes to our zone reporting structure, the composition of certain of our reporting units changed and we performed an interim impairment test (or transition test) on the affected reporting units on both a pre- and post-reorganization basis. \n\nWe performed our pre-reorganization impairment test as of June 28, 2020, which was our first day of the third quarter of 2020. There were no impairment losses resulting from this pre-reorganization impairment test. \n\nWe performed our post-reorganization impairment test as of June 28, 2020. There were three reporting units in scope for our post-reorganization impairment test: ESA, KSB, and MFC. These reporting units, which were tested as part of this post-reorganization impairment test, each had excess fair value over carrying amount as of June 28, 2020. \n\nAdditionally, in the third quarter of 2020, we announced the Cheese Transaction and determined that the Cheese Disposal Group was held for sale. Accordingly, based on a relative fair value allocation, we reclassified $ 580 million of goodwill to assets held for sale, which included a portion of goodwill from seven of our reporting units. Following the reclassification of a portion of goodwill from our reporting units, we determined that a triggering event had occurred for the remaining portion of each of the impacted reporting units, and we tested each for impairment as of September 15, 2020, the triggering event date. The triggering event impairment test did not result in an impairment of the remaining portion of any impacted reporting units. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $ 300 million in SG&#38;A, which was related to the Cheese Disposal Group&#8217;s goodwill. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , for additional information on the Cheese Transaction and its financial statement impacts. \n\nAdditional Goodwill Considerations \n\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax rates, discount rates, growth rates, and other market factors. Our current expectations also include certain assumptions that could be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet our pricing expectations in relation to inflation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or inflation, change, or if management&#8217;s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then one or more of our reporting units might become impaired in the future. Additionally, any decisions to divest certain non-strategic assets has led, and could in the future lead, to goodwill impairments. \n\nOur reporting units that have 20 % or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Although the remaining reporting units have more than 20 % excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz Acquisition and the 2015 Merger and were initially recorded at the time of acquisition on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to impairments. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets: \n\nChanges in the carrying amount of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consisted of trademarks, were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Balance at December 26, 2020 $ 42,267 &#160; Impairment losses ( 1,307 ) Divestitures ( 1,487 ) Translation adjustments and other ( 54 ) Balance at December 25, 2021 $ 39,419 &#160; Impairment losses ( 462 ) Translation adjustments and other ( 405 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 38,552 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing \n\nWe performed our Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test as of March 27, 2022, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2022. As a result of our Q2 2022 Annual Impairment Test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 395 million in SG&#38;A in our North America segment in the second quarter of 2022 related to four brands, Maxwell House , Miracle Whip , Jet Puffed , and Classico. We utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair values of the Maxwell House, Jet Puffed , and Classico brands and the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the Miracle Whip brand. The impairments of the Maxwell House, Jet Puffed , and Classico brands were primarily due to downward revisions in expected future operating margins as well as an increase in the discount rate, which was impacted by higher interest rates and other market inputs. The impairment of the Miracle Whip brand was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate as well as downward revisions in expected future operating margins due to changes in expectations for commodity input costs, including soybean oil. These brands had an aggregate carrying amount of $ 3.2 billion prior to these impairments and $ 2.8 billion after these impairments. \n\nWe performed our Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test as of June 26, 2022, which was our first day of the third quarter of 2022. As a result of our Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 67 million in SG&#38;A in the third quarter of 2022 related to two brands, Jet Puffed and Plasmon . We utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair values and recorded non-cash impairment losses of $ 50 million in our North America segment and $ 17 million in our International segment, consistent with ownership of the trademarks. The impairment of these brands was primarily due to reduced revenue growth assumptions. After the impairments, the aggregate carrying amount of these brands was $ 204 million. \n\nOur indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $ 38.6 billion at December 31, 2022. As of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, brands with 20 % or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of $ 16.6 billion, brands with between 20 %- 50 % fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount of $ 2.5 billion, and brands that had over 50 % fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount of $ 19.4 billion. \n\n2021 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing \n\nWe performed our 2021 annual impairment test as of March 28, 2021, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2021. As a result of our 2021 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 69 million in SG&#38;A in the second quarter of 2021 related to two brands, Plasmon and Maxwell House . We utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair values and recorded non-cash impairment losses of $ 45 million in our International segment related to Plasmon and $ 24 million in our North America segment related to Maxwell House , consistent with the ownership of the trademarks. The impairment of the Plasmon brand was largely due to downward revised revenue expectations for infant nutrition in Italy. The impairment of the Maxwell House brand was primarily due to downward revised revenue expectations for mainstream coffee in the U.S. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, following the monetization of the licensed portions of the Kraft and Velveeta brands in connection with the closing of the Cheese Transaction, we performed an interim impairment test and utilized the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value on these brands as of November 29, 2021, the Cheese Transaction Closing Date. While the Velveeta brand had a fair value in excess of its carrying amount, the Kraft brand had a fair value below its carrying amount. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $ 1.2 billion in SG&#38;A in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the Kraft brand. We recognized this impairment loss in our North America segment, consistent with the ownership of the Kraft trademark. \n\n2020 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing \n\nWe performed our 2020 annual impairment test as of March 29, 2020, which was the first day of our second quarter in 2020. As a result of our 2020 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $ 1.1 billion in SG&#38;A in the second quarter of 2020 primarily related to nine brands ( Oscar Mayer , Maxwell House , Velveeta , Cool Whip , Plasmon , ABC , Classico , Wattie&#8217;s , and Planters ), which included impairment losses of $ 956 million in our North America segment and $ 100 million in our International segment, consistent with the ownership of the trademarks. We utilized the excess earnings method and the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair values and recognized a $ 626 million impairment loss related to the Oscar Mayer brand, a $ 140 million impairment loss related to the Maxwell House brand, and a $ 290 million impairment loss primarily related to seven other brands ( Velveeta , Cool Whip , Plasmon , ABC , Classico , Wattie&#8217;s , and Planters ). \n\nAdditional Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Considerations \n\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. Our current expectations also include certain assumptions that could be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet our pricing expectations in relation to inflation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or inflation, change, or if management&#8217;s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then one or more of our brands might become impaired in the future. Additionally, any decisions to divest certain non-strategic assets has led, and could in the future lead, to intangible asset impairments. \n\nOur brands that were impaired were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates. Accordingly, these and other individual brands that have 20 % or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future. Although the remaining brands have more than 20 % excess fair value over carrying amount as of the Q3 2022 Annual Impairment Test, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz Acquisition and the 2015 Merger and were initially recorded at the time of acquisition on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future, these amounts are also susceptible to impairments. \n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets: \n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Trademarks $ 2,223 &#160; $ ( 649 ) $ 1,574 &#160; $ 2,091 &#160; $ ( 556 ) $ 1,535 &#160; Customer-related assets 3,690 &#160; ( 1,177 ) 2,513 &#160; 3,617 &#160; ( 1,040 ) 2,577 &#160; Other 13 &#160; ( 3 ) 10 &#160; 17 &#160; ( 6 ) 11 &#160; $ 5,926 &#160; $ ( 1,829 ) $ 4,097 &#160; $ 5,725 &#160; $ ( 1,602 ) $ 4,123 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 25, 2021, definite-lived intangible assets excluded amounts classified as held for sale. \n\nAmortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was $ 261 million in 2022, $ 239 million in 2021, and $ 264 million in 2020. Aside from amortization expense, the change in definite-lived intangible assets from December 25, 2021 to December 31, 2022 primarily reflects $ 315 million of additions, which are largely related to the Hemmer Acquisition, the Just Spices Acquisition, and the Assan Foods Acquisition, the impact of foreign currency, and $ 7 million of non-cash impairment losses related to two trademarks in our International segment. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , for additional information on these acquisitions. The impairment of definite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2022 relates to two trademarks that had a net carrying value that was deemed not to be recoverable. \n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we recorded $ 9 million of non-cash impairment losses to SG&#38;A related to a trademark in our International segment that had a net carrying value that was deemed not to be recoverable. \n\nWe estimate that amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets will be approximately $ 260 million in 2023 and $ 250 million in each of the following four years. \n\nNote 9. Income Taxes \n\nProvision for/(Benefit from) Income Taxes: \n\nIncome/(loss) before income taxes and the provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, consisted of the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Income/(loss) before income taxes: United States $ 1,575 &#160; $ ( 215 ) $ 363 &#160; Non-U.S. 1,391 &#160; 1,923 &#160; 667 &#160; Total $ 2,966 &#160; $ 1,708 &#160; $ 1,030 &#160; Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes: Current: U.S. federal $ 620 &#160; $ 1,421 &#160; $ 634 &#160; U.S. state and local 79 &#160; 120 &#160; 91 &#160; Non-U.S. 177 &#160; 185 &#160; 287 &#160; 876 &#160; 1,726 &#160; 1,012 &#160; Deferred: U.S. federal ( 192 ) ( 1,086 ) ( 232 ) U.S. state and local ( 35 ) ( 211 ) ( 109 ) Non-U.S. ( 51 ) 255 &#160; ( 2 ) ( 278 ) ( 1,042 ) ( 343 ) Total provision for/(benefit from) income taxes $ 598 &#160; $ 684 &#160; $ 669 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe record tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments within our tax provision. Accordingly, we recognized an insignificant tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income in each of 2022, 2021, and 2020 related to tax benefits upon the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments. \n\nEffective Tax Rate: \n\nThe effective tax rate on income/(loss) before income taxes differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the following reasons: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % Tax on income of foreign subsidiaries ( 8.2 ) % ( 12.9 ) % ( 26.1 ) % U.S. state and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.8 &#160; % ( 0.5 ) % 0.6 &#160; % Audit settlements and changes in uncertain tax positions 1.3 &#160; % 0.4 &#160; % 3.7 &#160; % Global intangible low-taxed income 1.8 &#160; % 5.5 &#160; % 6.5 &#160; % Goodwill impairment 3.9 &#160; % 4.7 &#160; % 57.2 &#160; % (Losses)/gains related to acquisitions and divestitures 0.3 &#160; % 12.9 &#160; % 0.1 &#160; % Movement of valuation allowance reserves 0.8 &#160; % 0.1 &#160; % ( 0.4 ) % Deferred tax effect of tax law changes ( 0.9 ) % 9.8 &#160; % ( 2.1 ) % Deferred tax adjustments ( 1.1 ) % 0.3 &#160; % 2.8 &#160; % Other ( 0.5 ) % ( 1.2 ) % 1.7 &#160; % Effective tax rate 20.2 &#160; % 40.1 &#160; % 65.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly, the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable tax rates. Additionally, the calculation of the percentage point impact of goodwill impairment and other items on the effective tax rate shown in the table above are affected by income/(loss) before income taxes. The percentage point impacts on the effective tax rates fluctuate due to income/(loss) before income taxes, which included goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses in all years presented in the table. Fluctuations in the amount of income generated across locations around the world could impact comparability of reconciling items between periods. Additionally, small movements in tax rates due to a change in tax law or a change in tax rates that causes us to revalue our deferred tax balances produces volatility in our effective tax rate. \n\nOur 2022 effective tax rate was an expense of 20.2 % on pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was impacted by the favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain favorable items, primarily the decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the merger of certain foreign entities, the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws, and changes in estimates of certain 2021 U.S. income and deductions. This impact was partially offset by the impact of certain unfavorable items, primarily non-deductible goodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;), and the establishment of uncertain tax positions and valuation allowance reserves. \n\nOur 2021 effective tax rate was an expense of 40.1 % on pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items, primarily the tax impacts related to acquisitions and divestitures, which mainly reflect the impacts of the Nuts Transaction and Cheese Transaction, partially offset by 2021 capital losses; the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in international and state tax rates, mainly an increase in U.K. tax rates; the impact of the federal tax on GILTI; and non-deductible goodwill impairments. These impacts were partially offset by a favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. \n\nOur 2020 effective tax rate was an expense of 65.0 % on pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items, primarily related to non-deductible goodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on GILTI, and the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in international tax laws. These impacts were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and the favorable impact of establishing certain deferred tax assets for state tax deductions. \n\nSee Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information related to our impairment losses. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , for additional information on our acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nDeferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities: \n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Deferred income tax liabilities: Intangible assets, net $ 9,985 &#160; $ 10,212 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net 680 &#160; 748 &#160; Right-of-use assets 131 &#160; 110 &#160; Other 408 &#160; 455 &#160; Deferred income tax liabilities 11,204 &#160; 11,525 &#160; Deferred income tax assets: Other employee benefits ( 111 ) ( 119 ) Deferred income ( 356 ) ( 369 ) Lease liabilities ( 139 ) ( 115 ) Other ( 693 ) ( 621 ) Deferred income tax assets ( 1,299 ) ( 1,224 ) Valuation allowance 96 &#160; 101 &#160; Net deferred income tax liabilities $ 10,001 &#160; $ 10,402 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe 2021 deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflected in the above table have been adjusted principally to reflect deferred taxes on the gross up of the operating lease right-of-use assets and the operating lease liabilities under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . This update had the effect of increasing both the total deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities by $ 210 million for the year ended December 25, 2021. These adjustments have no net impact on the net deferred income tax liabilities or on the consolidated financial statements and we do not believe they are material to the annual consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe decrease in net deferred income tax liabilities from December 25, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by intangible asset impairment losses in 2022. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional information on the impairment losses. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, foreign operating loss carryforwards totaled $ 621 million. Of that amount, $ 47 million expire between 2023 and 2042; the other $ 575 million do not expire. We have recorded $ 180 million of deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets of $ 22 million have been recorded for U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards. These losses expire between 2023 and 2042. At December 31, 2022, tax credit carryforwards totaled $ 55 million, which included state tax credits of $ 22 million, foreign credits of $ 18 million, and U.S. foreign tax credits of $ 15 million. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions: \n\nAt December 31, 2022, our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions were $ 455 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the impact on our effective tax rate would have been $ 425 million. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $ 3 million in the next 12 months primarily due to the progression of federal, state, and foreign audits in process. Our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are included in income taxes payable and other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nThe changes in our unrecognized tax benefits were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 441 &#160; $ 421 &#160; $ 406 &#160; Increases for tax positions of prior years 8 &#160; 13 &#160; 13 &#160; Decreases for tax positions of prior years ( 27 ) ( 51 ) ( 34 ) Increases based on tax positions related to the current year 53 &#160; 75 &#160; 57 &#160; Decreases due to settlements with taxing authorities ( 6 ) ( 1 ) ( 8 ) Decreases due to lapse of statute of limitations ( 14 ) ( 16 ) ( 13 ) Balance at the end of the period $ 455 &#160; $ 441 &#160; $ 421 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOur unrecognized tax benefits increased during 2022 and 2021 mainly as a result of a net increase for tax positions related to the current and prior years in the U.S. and certain state and foreign jurisdictions, which were partially offset by decreases related to audit settlements with federal, state, and foreign taxing authorities and statute of limitations expirations. \n\nWe include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. Our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included a $ 20 million expense in 2022, a $ 9 million expense in 2021, and a $ 10 million expense in 2020 related to interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $ 100 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 81 million as of December 25, 2021. \n\nOther Income Tax Matters: \n\nTax Examinations: \n\nWe are currently under examination for income taxes by the IRS for the years 2018 and 2019. We are continuing to respond to Information Document Requests. We have received a draft economist report and expect to receive a Notice of Proposed Adjustment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries asserting that our U.S. taxable income should have been higher in 2018 and 2019, which would result in additional U.S. tax expense for 2018 and 2019 plus interest and potential penalties. We strongly disagree with the IRS&#8217;s suggested position, believe that our tax positions are properly supported, and intend to vigorously contest the position taken by the IRS and pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies. We continue to maintain our operating model and believe our income tax reserves are appropriate for all open tax years and that final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain, and if we are required to pay the IRS additional U.S. taxes, interest, and potential penalties, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. \n\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Brazil, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we have substantially concluded all national income tax matters through 2020 for the Netherlands, through 2017 for the United States, through 2014 for Italy, through 2013 for the United Kingdom and Canada, and through 2013, with the exception of 2007 and 2008 which are under litigation, for Brazil. We have substantially concluded all U.S. state income tax matters through 2007. \n\nCash Held by International Subsidiaries: \n\nOur undistributed historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017 are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Related to these undistributed historic earnings, we had recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $ 10 million on approximately $ 90 million of historic earnings at December 31, 2022 and a deferred tax liability of approximately $ 10 million on approximately $ 135 million of historic earnings at December 25, 2021. The deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. \n\nSubsequent to January 1, 2018, we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed, if repatriated, related to our 2018 through 2022 accumulated earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately $ 50 million. \n\nDivestitures: \n\nRelated to the Cheese Transaction, we paid cash taxes of approximately $ 620 million in the second quarter of 2022. \n\nRelated to the Nuts Transaction, we paid cash taxes of approximately $ 700 million in the second half of 2021. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the United States. We are currently evaluating the law and do not expect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a significant impact on our financial statements, including our annual estimated effective tax rate. \n\nNote 10. Employees&#8217; Stock Incentive Plans \n\nWe grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;), and performance share units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;), to select employees to provide long-term performance incentives to our employees. \n\nStock Plans \n\nWe had activity related to equity awards from the following plans in 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n\n2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan: \n\nIn May 2020, our stockholders approved The Kraft Heinz Company 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2020 Omnibus Plan&#8221;), which was adopted by our Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;) in March 2020. The 2020 Omnibus Plan became effective March 2, 2020 (the &#8220;Plan Effective Date&#8221;) and will expire on the tenth anniversary of the Plan Effective Date. The 2020 Omnibus Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 36 million shares of our common stock for awards to employees, non-employee directors, and other key personnel. The 2020 Omnibus Plan provides for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, deferred stock, performance awards, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. Equity awards granted under the 2020 Omnibus Plan include awards that vest in full at the end of a three-year period as well as awards that vest in annual installments over three or four years beginning on the second anniversary of the original grant date. Non-qualified stock options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years from the date of the grant. As of the Plan Effective Date, awards will no longer be granted under The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the H. J. Heinz Holding Corporation 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan, Kraft Foods Group, Inc. 2012 Performance Incentive Plan, or any other equity plans other than the 2020 Omnibus Plan. \n\n2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan: \n\nIn April 2016, our stockholders approved The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (&#8220;2016 Omnibus Plan&#8221;), which was adopted by our Board in February 2016. The 2016 Omnibus Plan authorized grants of up to 18 million shares of our common stock pursuant to options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, deferred stock, performance awards, investment rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan prior to 2019 generally vest in full at the end of a five-year period. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan in 2019 include awards that vest in full at the end of three and five-year periods as well as awards that become exercisable in annual installments over three to four years beginning on the second anniversary of the original grant date. Non-qualified stock options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan since inception include non-qualified stock options, RSUs, and PSUs. \n\n2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan: \n\nPrior to approval of the 2016 Omnibus Plan, we issued non-qualified stock options to select employees under the H. J. Heinz Holding Corporation 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (&#8220;2013 Omnibus Plan&#8221;). As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Heinz stock option was converted into 0.443332 of a Kraft Heinz stock option. Following this conversion, the 2013 Omnibus Plan authorized the issuance of up to 17,555,947 shares of our common stock. Non-qualified stock options awarded under the 2013 Omnibus Plan vest in full at the end of a five-year period and have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. These non-qualified stock options have vested and become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 2013 Omnibus Plan and the relevant award agreements. \n\nKraft 2012 Performance Incentive Plan: \n\nPrior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued equity-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, under the Kraft Foods Group, Inc. 2012 Performance Incentive Plan (&#8220;2012 Performance Incentive Plan&#8221;). As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Kraft stock option was converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock based upon an option adjustment ratio, and each outstanding Kraft RSU was converted into one Kraft Heinz RSU. These options generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the original grant date, and have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. These RSUs generally vest in full on the third anniversary of the original grant date. In accordance with the terms of the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan, vesting generally accelerated for holders of Kraft awards who were terminated without cause within 2 years of the 2015 Merger Date. These Kraft Heinz equity awards have vested and become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger. \n\nIn addition, prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued performance-based, long-term incentive awards (&#8220;Kraft Performance Shares&#8221;), which vested based on varying performance, market, and service conditions. In connection with the 2015 Merger, all outstanding Kraft Performance Shares were converted into cash awards, payable in two installments: (i) a 2015 pro-rata payment based upon the portion of the Kraft Performance Share cycle completed prior to the 2015 Merger and (ii) the remaining value of the award to be paid on the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the 2015 Merger and a participant's termination without cause. \n\nStock Options \n\nWe use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants.

The expected term is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data, we calculated expected term using the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. We estimated volatility using a blended volatility approach of term-matched historical volatility from our daily stock prices and weighted average implied volatility. We estimated the expected dividend yield using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and continuously compounded. \n\nOur stock option activity and related information was: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Stock Options Weighted Average Exercise Price (per share) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Average Remaining Contractual Term Outstanding at December 25, 2021 11,778,068 &#160; $ 45.43 &#160; Granted 941,146 &#160; 38.68 &#160; Forfeited ( 1,091,515 ) 61.80 &#160; Exercised ( 2,068,636 ) 27.42 &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2022 9,559,063 &#160; 46.80 &#160; $ 37 &#160; 4 years Exercisable at December 31, 2022 6,621,706 &#160; 47.43 &#160; 29 &#160; 3 years ##TABLE_END\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the period was $ 24 million in 2022, $ 23 million in 2021, and $ 24 million in 2020 . \n\nCash received from options exercised was $ 57 million in 2022, $ 53 million in 2021, and $ 85 million in 2020.

Certain of our RSUs are not dividend eligible. We discounted the fair value of these RSUs based on the dividend yield. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and continuously compounded. The grant date fair value of RSUs is amortized to expense over the vesting period. \n\nThe weighted average grant date fair value per share of our RSUs granted during the year was $ 37.50 in 2022, $ 36.36 in 2021, and $ 29.27 in 2020.

The PSUs are not dividend eligible; therefore, we discounted the fair value of the PSUs based on the dividend yield. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and continuously compounded. The grant date fair value of PSUs is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the awards. We adjust the expense based on the likelihood of future achievement of performance metrics. \n\nFor our PSUs that are tied to market-based conditions, the grant date fair value was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation model, which takes into account expected volatility and dividend yield, among other things. The related compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. The final award is based on the achievement of market-based components and service-based vesting conditions and may equal 0% to 150% of the target grant amount, based on achievement of the market-based conditions. \n\nIn 2019, we granted PSUs to our Chief Executive Officer that were tied to market-based conditions. The vesting date for these awards occurred without the performance conditions having been met and the PSUs were forfeited. \n\nThe weighted average grant date fair value per share of our PSUs granted during the year was $ 34.45 in 2022, $ 35.03 in 2021, and $ 28.50 in 2020. Our expected dividend yield was 4.41 % in 2022, 4.63 % in 2021, and 5.10 % in 2020. For our PSUs that are tied to market-based conditions, our expected volatility was 32.92 % in 2022 and 38.90 % in 2021. \n\nOur PSU activity and related information was: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at December 25, 2021 5,319,980 &#160; $ 27.24 &#160; Granted 1,737,198 &#160; 34.45 &#160; Forfeited ( 1,525,761 ) 21.31 &#160; Vested ( 1,512,763 ) 28.41 &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2022 4,018,654 &#160; 32.15 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe aggregate fair value of PSUs that vested during the period was $ 58 million in 2022 and $ 69 million in 2021.

Current defined benefit pension plans are provided primarily for certain domestic union and foreign employees. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. The pension benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Defined contribution plans are provided for certain domestic unionized, non-union hourly, and salaried employees as well as certain employees in foreign locations. \n\nWe provide health care and other postretirement benefits to certain of our eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. Certain of our U.S. and Canadian employees may become eligible for such benefits. We may modify plan provisions or terminate plans at our discretion.

Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the security of the funds; achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances; and investing according to local regulations and requirements specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans&#8217; benefit payment cash flow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for the selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance.

Beginning in 2022, all equity exposure is provided through pooled funds valued at net asset value. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. This consists of direct cash holdings and institutional short-term investment vehicles. Direct cash holdings are valued based on cost, which approximates fair value and are classified as Level 1. Certain institutional short-term investment vehicles are valued daily and are classified as Level 1. Other cash equivalents that are not traded on an active exchange, such as bank deposits, are classified as Level 2. \n\nReal Estate. These holdings consist of real estate investments and are generally classified as Level 3. \n\nCertain Insurance Contracts. This category consists of group annuity contracts that have been purchased to cover a portion of the plan members and have been classified as Level 3. \n\nInvestments Measured at Net Asset Value . This category consists of pooled funds, short-term investments, and partnership/corporate feeder interests. \n\n&#8226; Pooled funds. The fair values of participation units held in collective trusts are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers of the collective trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the collective trusts can be redeemed daily, monthly, or quarterly based upon the applicable net asset value per unit and the terms of the specific trust agreements. \n\nThe mutual fund investments are not traded on an exchange, and a majority of these funds are held in a separate account managed by a fixed income manager. The fair values of these investments are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The objective of the account is to provide superior return with reasonable risk, where performance is expected to exceed Barclays Long U.S. Credit Index. Investments in this account can be redeemed with a written notice to the investment manager. \n\n&#8226; Short-term investments. Short-term investments largely consist of a money market fund, the fair value of which is based on the net asset value reported by the manager of the fund and supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The money market fund is designed to provide safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a competitive yield by investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money market fund is to provide the highest possible level of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital. \n\n&#8226; Partnership/corporate feeder interests. Fair value estimates of the equity partnership are based on their net asset values, as reported by the manager of the partnership. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the equity partnership may be redeemed once per month upon 10 days&#8217; prior written notice to the General Partner, subject to the discretion of the General Partner. The investment objective of the equity partnership is to seek capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities. \n\nThe fair values of the corporate feeder are based upon the net asset values of the equity master fund in which it invests. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the corporate feeder can be redeemed quarterly with at least 90 days&#8217; notice. The investment objective of the corporate feeder is to generate long-term returns by investing in large, liquid equity securities with attractive fundamentals. \n\nChanges in our Level 3 plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 included (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Asset Category December 25, 2021 Additions Net Realized Gain/(Loss) Net Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3 December 31, 2022 Real estate $ 6 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ ( 5 ) $ ( 3 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Certain insurance contracts 488 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 198 ) ( 15 ) &#8212; &#160; 275 &#160; Total Level 3 investments $ 494 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ ( 203 ) $ ( 18 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ 275 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nChanges in our Level 3 plan assets for the year ended December 25, 2021 included (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Asset Category December 26, 2020 Additions Net Realized Gain/(Loss) Net Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Net Purchases, Issuances and Settlements Transfers Into/(Out of) Level 3 December 25, 2021 Real estate $ 35 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 1 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 27 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6 &#160; Corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; Certain insurance contracts 47 &#160; 464 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 13 ) ( 10 ) &#8212; &#160; 488 &#160; Total Level 3 investments $ 83 &#160; $ 464 &#160; $ ( 1 ) $ ( 14 ) $ ( 37 ) $ ( 1 ) $ 494 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEmployer Contributions: \n\nIn 2022, we contributed $ 11 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.

Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates going forward. \n\nThe year that the health care cost trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate varies by plan and ranges between 2023 and 2030 as of December 31, 2022. Assumed health care costs trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. \n\nComponents of Net Postretirement Cost/(Benefit): \n\nNet postretirement cost/(benefit) consisted of the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Service cost $ 4 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 6 &#160; Interest cost 27 &#160; 20 &#160; 33 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 54 ) ( 49 ) ( 49 ) Amortization of prior service costs/(credits) ( 15 ) ( 8 ) ( 122 ) Amortization of unrecognized losses/(gains) ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 14 ) Curtailments &#8212; &#160; ( 4 ) &#8212; &#160; Net postretirement cost/(benefit) $ ( 53 ) $ ( 51 ) $ ( 146 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nWe present all non-service cost components of net postretirement cost/(benefit) within other expense/(income) on our consolidated statements of income.

This gain is recorded in other expense/(income) as a component of our pre-tax loss/(gain) on sale of business on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 25, 2021. \n\nThe amortization of prior service credits was primarily driven by plan amendments in 2015 and 2016. We estimate that amortization of prior service credits will be insignificant in each of the next five years. \n\nWe used the following weighted average assumptions to determine our net postretirement benefit plans cost for the years ended: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Discount rate - Service cost 2.8 &#160; % 2.7 &#160; % 3.3 &#160; % Discount rate - Interest cost 3.4 &#160; % 1.6 &#160; % 2.7 &#160; % Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.4 &#160; % 4.4 &#160; % 4.7 &#160; % Health care cost trend rate 6.6 &#160; % 5.9 &#160; % 6.2 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nDiscount rates for our plans were developed from a model portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets' target asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates going forward. \n\nPlan Assets: \n\nThe underlying basis of the investment strategy of our U.S. postretirement plans is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans&#8217; benefit obligations when they are due by investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the security of the funds. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans&#8217; benefit payment cash flow requirements. \n\nOur weighted average asset allocations were: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Fixed-income securities 61 &#160; % 61 &#160; % Equity securities 33 &#160; % 36 &#160; % Cash and cash equivalents 6 &#160; % 3 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nOur postretirement benefit plan investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. Our investment strategy is designed to align our postretirement benefit plan assets with our postretirement benefit obligation to reduce volatility. In aggregate, our long-term asset allocation targets are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 70 % in fixed-income securities and approximately 30 % in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities. \n\nThe fair value of postretirement benefit plan assets at December 31, 2022 was determined using the following fair value measurements (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Asset Category Total Fair Value Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Government bonds $ 102 &#160; $ 102 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities 437 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 437 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total fixed-income securities 539 &#160; 102 &#160; 437 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Equity securities 163 &#160; 163 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fair value excluding investments measured at net asset value 702 &#160; 265 &#160; 437 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Investments measured at net asset value 185 &#160; Total plan assets at fair value $ 887 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair value of postretirement benefit plan assets at December 25, 2021 was determined using the following fair value measurements (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Asset Category Total Fair Value Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Government bonds $ 112 &#160; $ 112 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities 590 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 590 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total fixed-income securities 702 &#160; 112 &#160; 590 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Equity securities 236 &#160; 236 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fair value excluding investments measured at net asset value 938 &#160; 348 &#160; 590 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Investments measured at net asset value 213 &#160; Total plan assets at fair value $ 1,151 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of postretirement benefit plan assets, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified. \n\nGovernment Bonds.

These securities are included in Level 1. \n\nCorporate Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities. These securities consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds). Such investments are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other observable market data. As such, these securities are included in Level 2. \n\nEquity Securities. These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1. \n\nInvestments Measured at Net Asset Value . This category consists of pooled funds and short-term investments. \n\n&#8226; Pooled funds. The fair values of participation units held in collective trusts are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers of the collective trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy.

Foreign exchange options are valued using an income approach based on a Black-Scholes-Merton formula. This formula uses present value techniques and reflects the time value and intrinsic value based on observable market rates. Cross-currency swaps are valued based on observable market spot and swap rates. \n\nWe did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities in any period presented. \n\nOur calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. \n\nNet Investment Hedging: \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had the following items designated as net investment hedges: \n\n&#8226; Non-derivative foreign denominated debt with principal amounts of &#8364; 650 million and &#163; 400 million; and \n\n&#8226; Cross-currency contracts with notional amounts of C$ 1.4 billion ($ 1.0 billion), &#8364; 1.9 billion ($ 2.1 billion), JPY 9.6 billion ($ 67 million), and CNH 500 million ($ 68 million). \n\nWe periodically use non-derivative instruments such as non-U.S. dollar financing transactions or non-U.S. dollar assets or liabilities, including intercompany loans, to hedge the exposure of changes in underlying foreign currency denominated subsidiary net assets, and they are designated as net investment hedges. At December 31, 2022, our intercompany loans designated as net investment hedges were insignificant. \n\nThe component of the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated foreign operations, driven by changes in foreign exchange rates, are economically offset by fair value movements on the effective portion of our cross-currency contracts and foreign exchange contracts and remeasurements of our foreign denominated debt. \n\nInterest Rate Hedging: \n\nFrom time to time we have had derivatives designated as interest rate hedges, including interest rate swaps. We no longer have any outstanding interest rate swaps. We continue to amortize the realized hedge losses that were deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) into interest expense through the original maturity of the related long-term debt instruments. \n\nCash Flow Hedge Coverage: \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had entered into foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods not exceeding the next two years and into cross-currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods not exceeding the next six years . \n\nDeferred Hedging Gains and Losses on Cash Flow Hedges: \n\nBased on our valuation at December 31, 2022 and assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, we expect transfers to net income/(loss) of unrealized gains during the next 12 months on foreign currency cash flow hedges to be approximately $ 26 million and on cross-currency cash flow hedges to be insignificant. Additionally, we expect transfers to net income/(loss) of unrealized losses on interest rate cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be insignificant. \n\nConcentration of Credit Risk: \n\nCounterparties to our foreign exchange derivatives consist of major international financial institutions. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one party. While we may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non-performance by these counterparties, losses are not anticipated. We closely monitor the credit risk associated with our counterparties and customers and to date have not experienced material losses. \n\nEconomic Hedging: \n\nWe enter into certain derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with our risk management strategy, which have an economic impact of largely mitigating commodity price risk and foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses are recorded in net income/(loss) as a component of cost of products sold for our commodity contracts and other expense/(income) for our cross currency and foreign exchange contracts. \n\nAcquisition Hedging: \n\nWe entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the cash consideration for the Hemmer Acquisition. These derivative contracts settled in our second quarter of 2022. The related derivative gains were $ 38 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and were recorded within other expense/(income). These gains are classified as other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures. The related cash flows were classified as cash inflows from investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures , for additional information related to the Hemmer Acquisition. \n\nDerivative Impact on the Statements of Comprehensive Income: \n\nThe following table presents the pre-tax amounts of derivative gains/(losses) deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and the income statement line item that will be affected when reclassified to net income/(loss) (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Losses) Component Gains/(Losses) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income/(Losses) Related to Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Location of Gains/(Losses) When Reclassified to Net Income/(Loss) December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 1 &#160;

This activity was primarily related to foreign currency translation adjustments. \n\nNote 14. Financing Arrangements \n\nWe enter into various product financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification is based on the nature of the arrangements. We have concluded that our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are impacted by their participation in the program and therefore we classify amounts outstanding within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We had approximately $ 87 million at December 31, 2022 and approximately $ 215 million at December 25, 2021 on our consolidated balance sheets related to these arrangements. \n\nTransfers of Financial Assets: \n\nSince 2020, we have had a nonrecourse accounts receivable factoring program whereby certain eligible receivables are sold to third party financial institutions in exchange for cash. The program provides us with an additional means for managing liquidity. Under the terms of the arrangement, we act as the collecting agent on behalf of the financial institutions to collect amounts due from customers for the receivables sold. We account for the transfer of receivables as a true sale at the point control is transferred through derecognition of the receivable on our consolidated balance sheet. Receivables sold under this accounts receivable factoring program were approximately $ 197 million during 2022, with an insignificant amount outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The incremental costs of factoring receivables under this arrangement were insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2022. No receivables were sold under this accounts receivable factoring program during 2021, and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 25, 2021. The proceeds from the sales of receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. \n\nNote 15. Commitments and Contingencies \n\nLegal Proceedings \n\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inquiries, inspections, or investigations (&#8220;Legal Matters&#8221;) arising in the ordinary course of our business. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of Legal Matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve the Legal Matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nClass Actions and Stockholder Derivative Actions: \n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company and certain of our current and former officers and directors are currently defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Union Asset Management Holding AG, et al. v. The Kraft Heinz Company, et al . The consolidated amended class action complaint, which was filed on August 14, 2020 and also names 3G Capital, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries and affiliates (the &#8220;3G Entities&#8221;) as defendants, asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in public statements, press releases, investor presentations, earnings calls, Company documents, and SEC filings regarding the Company&#8217;s business, financial results, and internal controls, and further alleges the 3G Entities engaged in insider trading and misappropriated the Company&#8217;s material, non-public information. In February 2023, the parties to the litigation reached a preliminary settlement agreement. Based upon our current estimate for the ultimate resolution of this matter, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a net expense of $ 210 million within SG&#38;A in our consolidated statements of income. This expense contemplates the Company&#8217;s estimated liability after insurance recoveries and contributions from other defendants. The Company&#8217;s estimated liability and the insurance recoveries are reflected in current liabilities and current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. While it is possible that the ultimate amount of our liability in connection with this settlement could be different than the amount accrued, we believe that any difference between that ultimate liability and the amount already accrued will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Any eventual final settlement agreement will be subject to approval by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. \n\nCertain of The Kraft Heinz Company&#8217;s current and former officers and directors and the 3G Entities are also named as defendants in a stockholder derivative action, In re Kraft Heinz Shareholder Derivative Litigation , which had been previously consolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and is now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The court appointed lead plaintiffs and plaintiffs&#8217; counsel on October 21, 2021, and lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 22, 2021. The consolidated amended complaint asserts state law claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment, as well as federal claims for contribution for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in public statements and SEC filings, and for implementing cost cutting measures that allegedly damaged the Company. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount, attorneys&#8217; fees, and other relief. \n\nCertain of The Kraft Heinz Company&#8217;s current and former officers and directors and the 3G Entities were also named as defendants in a consolidated stockholder derivative action, In re Kraft Heinz Company Derivative Litigation , which was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The consolidated amended complaint, which was filed on April 27, 2020, alleged state law claims, contending that the 3G Entities were controlling stockholders who owed fiduciary duties to the Company, and that they breached those duties by allegedly engaging in insider trading and misappropriating the Company&#8217;s material, non-public information. The complaint further alleged that certain of The Kraft Heinz Company&#8217;s current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by purportedly making materially misleading statements and omissions regarding the Company&#8217;s financial performance and the impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets, and by supposedly approving or allowing the 3G Entities&#8217; alleged insider trading. The complaint sought relief against the defendants in the form of damages, disgorgement of all profits obtained from the alleged insider trading, contribution and indemnification, and an award of attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint, which motion the Delaware Chancery Court granted in an order dated December 15, 2021. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on January 13, 2022, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the trial court&#8217;s dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated amended complaint in an order dated August 1, 2022. \n\nCertain of The Kraft Heinz Company&#8217;s current and former officers and directors and the 3G Entities are named as defendants in an additional stockholder derivative action, Datnoff, et al. v. Behring, et al. , which was filed on May 6, 2022 in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleges state law claims and contends that the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors wrongfully refused plaintiffs&#8217; demands to pursue legal action against the named defendants. Specifically, the complaint alleges that certain of the Company&#8217;s current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by purportedly making materially misleading statements and omissions regarding the Company&#8217;s financial performance and the impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets. The complaint further alleges that the 3G Entities and certain of the Company&#8217;s current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in insider trading and misappropriating the Company&#8217;s material, non-public information, or aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaint seeks relief against the defendants, principally in the form of damages, disgorgement of all profits obtained from the alleged insider trading, contribution and indemnification, and an award of attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. \n\nWe intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits; however, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss, if any, due to the early stage of these proceedings. \n\n2021 United States Government Settlement: \n\nOn September 3, 2021, The Kraft Heinz Company reached a settlement with the SEC, concluding and resolving in its entirety the previously disclosed SEC investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, we, without admitting or denying the findings in the administrative order issued by the SEC, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $ 62 million and to cease and desist from violations of specified provisions of the federal securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder. We recognized the full amount of the penalty in the second quarter of 2021 in SG&#38;A, and paid the penalty in the third quarter of 2021. \n\nOther Commitments and Contingencies \n\nPurchase Obligations: \n\nWe have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage, and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology, and professional services. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our take-or-pay purchase obligations were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 $ 487 &#160; 2024 504 &#160; 2025 262 &#160; 2026 227 &#160; 2027 70 &#160; Thereafter 261 &#160; Total $ 1,811 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNote 16. Debt \n\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, tender offers, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancing, exchange offers, open market or privately negotiated transactions, Rule 10b5-1 plans, or otherwise. Cash payments related to debt extinguishment are classified as cash outflows from financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt are recognized in interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. \n\nBorrowing Arrangements: \n\nIn July 2022, together with Kraft Heinz Foods Company (&#8220;KHFC&#8221;), our 100% owned operating subsidiary, we entered into a new credit agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;), which provides for a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $ 4.0 billion (the &#8220;Senior Credit Facility&#8221;) that will mature on July 8, 2027 and replaced our then-existing credit facility (the &#8220;Previous Senior Credit Facility&#8221;). See Note 17, Debt , to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information on the Previous Senior Credit Facility. \n\nThe Credit Agreement includes a $ 1.0 billion sublimit for borrowings in Canadian dollars, euro, or British pound sterling, as well as a swingline sub-facility of up to $ 400 million, and a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $ 300 million. Additionally, and subject to certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $ 1.0 billion. \n\nBorrowings under the Senior Credit Facility will bear interest at the rates specified in the Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of borrowing and certain other customary conditions. \n\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, restrict our ability to access our Senior Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum shareholders&#8217; equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)) of at least $ 35 billion. \n\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by KHFC and The Kraft Heinz Company in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global economy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $ 4.0 billion under our Previous Senior Credit Facility. We repaid the full $ 4.0 billion during the second quarter of 2020. No amounts were drawn on our Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2022, on our Previous Senior Credit Facility at December 25, 2021, or on either the Senior Credit Facility or Previous Senior Credit Facility during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. \n\nLong-Term Debt: \n\nThe following table summarizes our long-term debt obligations. \n\n##TABLE_START Priority (a) \n\nMaturity Dates (b) \n\nInterest Rates (b) \n\nCarrying Values December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (in millions) U.S. dollar notes (c) \n\nSenior Notes 2026&#8211;2050 3.000 %&#8211; 7.125 % \n\n$ 16,554 &#160; $ 18,049 &#160; \n\nEuro notes (c) \n\nSenior Notes 2023&#8211;2028 1.500 %&#8211; 2.250 % \n\n2,723 &#160; 2,877 &#160; British pound sterling notes: 2030 Notes (d) \n\nSenior Notes February 18, 2030 6.250 % \n\n155 &#160; 172 &#160; Other British pound sterling notes (c) \n\nSenior Notes July 1, 2027 4.125 % \n\n482 &#160; 533 &#160; Other long-term debt Various 2023&#8211;2035 0.500 %&#8211; 16.800 % \n\n31 &#160; 42 &#160; Finance lease obligations 119 &#160; 128 &#160; Total long-term debt 20,064 &#160; 21,801 &#160; Current portion of long-term debt 831 &#160; 740 &#160; Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 19,233 &#160; $ 21,061 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Priority of debt indicates the order which debt would be paid if all debt obligations were due on the same day.

Heinz Finance UK Plc. Kraft Heinz and KHFC fully and unconditionally guarantee the 2030 Notes. The 2030 Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior obligations. Kraft Heinz became guarantor of the 2030 Notes in connection with the 2015 Merger. The 2030 Notes were previously only guaranteed by KHFC. \n\nOur long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default.

Refer to the table above for which senior notes had amounts extinguished as part of the 2022 Repurchases. \n\nIn connection with the 2022 Repurchases, we recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $ 38 million within interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included a net gain of $ 9 million in the second quarter of 2022 related to the Q2 2022 Repurchases, a net gain of $ 3 million in the third quarter of 2022 related to the Q3 2022 Repurchases, and a net gain of $ 26 million in the fourth quarter related to the Q4 2022 Repurchases. This gain primarily reflects the write-off of unamortized premiums and a net discount associated with the 2022 Repurchases. Related to the 2022 Repurchases, we recognized a debt prepayment and extinguishment benefit of $ 10 million on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, which reflect the $ 38 million net gain on extinguishment of debt adjusted for the non-cash write-off of unamortized premiums of $ 33 million, unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 3 million, and unamortized discounts of $ 2 million. \n\n2021 Open Market Debt Repurchases \n\nIn 2021, we repurchased approximately $ 738 million of certain of our senior notes under Rule 10b5-1 plans, including $ 207 million in the second quarter of 2021 (the &#8220;Q2 2021 Repurchases&#8221;), $ 221 million in the third quarter of 2021 (the &#8220;Q3 2021 Repurchases&#8221;), and $ 310 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 (the &#8220;Q4 2021 Repurchases&#8221; and, together with the Q2 2021 Repurchases and the Q3 2021 Repurchases, the &#8220;2021 Repurchases&#8221;). See Note 17, Debt , to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2021 for additional information on the 2021 Repurchases. \n\nIn connection with the 2021 Repurchases, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $ 152 million within interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 25, 2021. These losses primarily reflect the payment of premiums associated with the repurchases as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums, and discounts. Related to the 2021 Repurchases, we recognized debt prepayment and extinguishment costs of $ 162 million on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 25, 2021, which reflect the $ 152 million loss on extinguishment of debt adjusted for the non-cash write-off of unamortized premiums of $ 15 million, unamortized discounts of $ 2 million, and unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 3 million. \n\nTender Offers: \n\n2021 Tender Offers \n\nIn February 2021, KHFC commenced a cash tender offer to purchase up to the maximum combined aggregate purchase price of $ 1.0 billion, including principal and premium but excluding accrued and unpaid interest (the &#8220;Q1 2021 Maximum Tender Amount&#8221;), of its outstanding 3.950 % senior notes due July 2025, 3.000 % senior notes due June 2026, 4.000 % senior notes due June 2023, and 3.500 % senior notes due June 2022 (the &#8220;Q1 2021 Tender Offer&#8221;), listed in order of priority. Based on participation, KHFC elected to settle the Q1 2021 Tender Offer on the early settlement date, March 9, 2021. Since the aggregate purchase price of the senior notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the early tender time exceeded the Q1 2021 Maximum Tender Amount, we did not accept for purchase any of the 3.500 % senior notes due June 2022 or the 4.000 % senior notes due June 2023. The aggregate principal amount of senior notes validly tendered and accepted was approximately $ 900 million. \n\nIn June 2021, KHFC commenced cash tender offers to purchase up to the maximum combined aggregate purchase price of $ 2.8 billion, including principal and premium but excluding accrued and unpaid interest, of its 5.000 % senior notes due June 2042, 5.000 % senior notes due July 2035, 4.625 % senior notes due January 2029, 4.625 % senior notes due October 2039, 3.750 % senior notes due April 2030, 6.500 % senior notes due February 2040, 6.375 % senior notes due July 2028, 6.750 % senior notes due March 2032, 6.875 % senior notes due January 2039, and 7.125 % senior notes due August 2039 (the &#8220;Q2 2021 Tender Offers&#8221;), listed in order of priority.

KHFC settled the Q4 2021 Tender Offer on December 6, 2021. Since the aggregate purchase price of the senior notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the early tender time exceeded the Q4 2021 Maximum Tender Amount, we did not accept for purchase any of the 6.500 % senior notes due February 2040, 5.000 % senior notes due June 2042, 5.200 % senior notes due July 2045, 6.875 % senior notes due January 2039, 7.125 % senior notes due August 2039, 5.500 % senior notes due June 2050, and 4.875 % senior notes due October 2049.

These losses primarily reflect the payment of early tender premiums and fees associated with the 2021 Tender Offers as well as the write-off of unamortized premiums, debt issuance costs, and discounts. Related to the 2021 Tender Offers, we recognized debt prepayment and extinguishment costs of $ 636 million on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 25, 2021, which reflects the $ 636 million loss on extinguishment of debt adjusted for the non-cash write-off of unamortized premiums of $ 24 million, unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 17 million, and unamortized discounts of $ 7 million. \n\n2020 Tender Offer \n\nIn May 2020, KHFC commenced a cash tender offer to purchase up to the maximum combined aggregate purchase price of $ 2.2 billion, excluding accrued and unpaid interest (the &#8220;2020 Maximum Tender Amount&#8221;), of its outstanding floating rate senior notes due February 2021, 3.500 % senior notes due June 2022, 3.500 % senior notes due July 2022, floating rate senior notes due August 2022, 4.000 % senior notes due June 2023, 3.950 % senior notes due July 2025, and 3.000 % senior notes due June 2026 (the &#8220;2020 Tender Offer&#8221;), listed in order of priority. As a result of the 2020 Tender Offer, KHFC extinguished approximately $ 2.1 billion aggregate principal amounts of senior notes in the second quarter of 2020. None of the 3.000 % senior notes due June 2026 were tendered based on the aggregate principal amount of senior notes validly tendered exceeding the 2020 Maximum Tender Amount. See Note 18, Debt , to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2020 for additional information on the 2020 Tender Offer. \n\nIn connection with the 2020 Tender Offer, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 71 million within interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 26, 2020. This loss primarily reflects the payment of early tender premiums and fees associated with the 2020 Tender Offer as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums, and discounts.

Prior to the Q3 2021 Redemption, approximately $ 797 million aggregate principal amount was outstanding. \n\nIn connection with the 2021 Debt Redemptions, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 129 million within interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 25, 2021. These losses primarily reflect the payment of premiums and fees associated with the redemptions as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

The effective date of the Second 2020 Debt Redemption was October 24, 2020. \n\nIn connection with the 2020 Debt Redemptions, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 53 million within interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 26, 2020.

The 2020 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kraft Heinz Company as to payment of principal, premium, and interest on a senior unsecured basis. We used the proceeds from the 2020 Notes to fund the 2020 Tender Offer and First 2020 Debt Redemptions and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith. \n\nDebt Issuance Costs: \n\nDebt issuance costs are reflected as a direct deduction of our current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt balances on the consolidated balance sheets. We incurred an insignificant amount of debt issuance costs in 2022 and debt issuance costs of $ 31 million in 2020. We did not incur any debt issuance costs in 2021. Unamortized debt issuance costs were $ 88 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 97 million at December 25, 2021. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $ 11 million in 2022, $ 12 million in 2021, and $ 11 million in 2020. \n\nDebt Premium: \n\nUnamortized debt premiums are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct addition to the carrying amount of debt. Unamortized debt premium, net, was $ 250 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 298 million at December 25, 2021. Amortization of our debt premium, net, was $ 17 million in 2022, $ 16 million in 2021, and $ 14 million in 2020. \n\nDebt Repayments: \n\nIn March 2022, we repaid $ 6 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. \n\nIn June 2022, we repaid $ 381 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. \n\nIn August 2022, we repaid $ 315 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes that matured in the period. \n\nIn February 2021, we repaid $ 111 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes that matured in the period. \n\nIn September 2021, we repaid $ 34 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. \n\nIn February 2020, we repaid $ 405 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. \n\nIn July 2020, we repaid $ 200 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and 500 million Canadian dollars aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. \n\nFair Value of Debt: \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $ 18.7 billion as compared with a carrying value of $ 20.1 billion. At December 25, 2021, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $ 25.7 billion as compared with a carrying value of $ 21.8 billion. Our short-term debt had a carrying value that approximated its fair value at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. We determined the fair value of our long-term debt using Level 2 inputs. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. \n\nNote 17. Leases \n\nWe have operating and finance leases, primarily for warehouse, production, and office facilities and equipment. Our lease contracts have remaining contractual lease terms of up to 19 years, some of which include options to extend the term by up to 10 years. We include renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the lease term. Additionally, some lease contracts include termination options. We do not expect to exercise the majority of our termination options and generally exclude such options when determining the term of our leases. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , for our lease accounting policy. \n\nThe components of our lease costs were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Operating lease costs $ 173 &#160; $ 176 &#160; $ 173 &#160; Finance lease costs: Amortization of right-of-use assets 34 &#160; 34 &#160; 31 &#160; Interest on lease liabilities 5 &#160; 6 &#160; 7 &#160; Short-term lease costs 8 &#160; 17 &#160; 20 &#160; Variable lease costs 1,232 &#160; 1,192 &#160; 1,313 &#160; Sublease income ( 10 ) ( 9 ) ( 11 ) Total lease costs $ 1,442 &#160; $ 1,416 &#160; $ 1,533 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOur variable lease costs primarily consist of inventory related costs, such as materials, labor, and overhead components in our manufacturing and distribution arrangements that also contain a fixed component related to an embedded lease. These variable lease costs are determined based on usage or output or may vary for other reasons such as changes in material prices, taxes, or insurance. Certain of our variable lease costs are based on fluctuating indices or rates. These leases are included in our ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date. The future variability in these indices and rates is unknown; therefore, it is excluded from our future minimum lease payments and is not a component of our ROU assets or lease liabilities. \n\nLosses/(gains) on sales and leaseback transactions, net, were insignificant for 2022 and 2021. We had no losses/(gains) on sale and leaseback transactions in 2020. \n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to our leases was (in millions, except lease term and discount rate): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Operating Leases Finance Leases Operating Leases Finance Leases Right-of-use assets $ 668 &#160; $ 121 &#160; $ 569 &#160; $ 126 &#160; Lease liabilities (current) 125 &#160; 26 &#160; 133 &#160; 30 &#160; Lease liabilities (non-current) 585 &#160; 93 &#160; 484 &#160; 98 &#160; Weighted average remaining lease term 8 years 12 years 7 years 12 years Weighted average discount rate 3.6 &#160; % 4.1 &#160; % 3.5 &#160; % 4.1 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating lease ROU assets are included in other non-current assets and finance lease ROU assets are included in property, plant and equipment, net, on our consolidated balance sheets.

The non-current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other non-current liabilities , and the non-current portion of finance lease liabilities is included in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nCash flows arising from lease transactions were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash inflows/(outflows) from operating leases $ ( 176 ) $ ( 179 ) $ ( 191 ) Operating cash inflows/(outflows) from finance leases ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Financing cash inflows/(outflows) from finance leases ( 38 ) ( 33 ) ( 35 ) Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities: Operating leases 197 &#160; 41 &#160; 147 &#160; Finance leases 34 &#160; 14 &#160; 39 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFuture minimum lease payments for leases in effect at December 31, 2022 were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Operating Leases Finance Leases 2023 $ 149 &#160; $ 30 &#160; 2024 125 &#160; 20 &#160; 2025 105 &#160; 14 &#160; 2026 90 &#160; 11 &#160; 2027 71 &#160; 8 &#160; Thereafter 290 &#160; 68 &#160; Total future undiscounted lease payments 830 &#160; 151 &#160; Less imputed interest ( 120 ) ( 32 ) Total lease liability $ 710 &#160; $ 119 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our operating and finance leases that had not yet commenced were insignificant. \n\nNote 18. Capital Stock \n\nCommon Stock \n\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5.0 billion shares of common stock. \n\nShares of common stock issued, in treasury, and outstanding were (in millions of shares): \n\n##TABLE_START Shares Issued Treasury Shares Shares Outstanding Balance at December 28, 2019 1,224 &#160; ( 3 ) 1,221 &#160; Exercise of stock options, issuance of other stock awards, and other 4 &#160; ( 2 ) 2 &#160; Balance at December 26, 2020 1,228 &#160; ( 5 ) 1,223 &#160; Exercise of stock options, issuance of other stock awards, and other 7 &#160; ( 6 ) 1 &#160; Balance at December 25, 2021 1,235 &#160; ( 11 ) 1,224 &#160; Exercise of stock options, issuance of other stock awards, and other 8 &#160; ( 7 ) 1 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2022 1,243 &#160; ( 18 ) 1,225 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNote 19. Earnings Per Share \n\nOur earnings per common share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) were: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 &#160; (in millions, except per share data) Basic Earnings Per Common Share: Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 2,363 &#160; $ 1,012 &#160; $ 356 &#160; Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,226 &#160; 1,224 &#160; 1,223 &#160; Net earnings/(loss) $ 1.93 &#160; $ 0.83 &#160; $ 0.29 &#160; Diluted Earnings Per Common Share: Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 2,363 &#160; $ 1,012 &#160; $ 356 &#160; Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,226 &#160; 1,224 &#160; 1,223 &#160; Effect of dilutive equity awards 9 &#160; 12 &#160; 5 &#160; Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, including dilutive effect 1,235 &#160; 1,236 &#160; 1,228 &#160; Net earnings/(loss) $ 1.91 &#160; $ 0.82 &#160; $ 0.29 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe use the treasury stock method to calculate the dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards in the denominator for diluted EPS. Anti-dilutive shares were 6 million in 2022, 7 million in 2021, and 9 million in 2020. \n\nNote 20. Segment Reporting \n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed. We combined our United States and Canada zones to form the North America zone as a result of previously announced organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by streamlining and synergizing our United States and Canada businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. \n\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of divestiture-related license income (e.g., income related to the sale of licenses in connection with the Cheese Transaction), restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment&#8217;s operating results), impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, and equity award compensation expense (excluding restructuring activities). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management also uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to allocate resources. \n\nManagement does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources. Therefore, we do not disclose assets by segment. \n\nNet sales by segment were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Net sales: North America $ 20,340 &#160; $ 20,351 &#160; $ 20,844 &#160; International 6,145 &#160; 5,691 &#160; 5,341 &#160; Total net sales $ 26,485 &#160; $ 26,042 &#160; $ 26,185 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA was (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Segment Adjusted EBITDA: North America $ 5,284 &#160; $ 5,576 &#160; $ 5,946 &#160; International 1,017 &#160; 1,066 &#160; 1,058 &#160; General corporate expenses ( 298 ) ( 271 ) ( 335 ) Depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities) ( 922 ) ( 910 ) ( 955 ) Divestiture-related license income 56 &#160; 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restructuring activities ( 74 ) ( 84 ) ( 15 ) Deal costs ( 9 ) ( 11 ) ( 8 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges ( 63 ) ( 17 ) 6 &#160; Impairment losses ( 999 ) ( 1,634 ) ( 3,413 ) Certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters ( 210 ) ( 62 ) &#8212; &#160; Equity award compensation expense ( 148 ) ( 197 ) ( 156 ) Operating income/(loss) 3,634 &#160; 3,460 &#160; 2,128 &#160; Interest expense 921 &#160; 2,047 &#160; 1,394 &#160; Other expense/(income) ( 253 ) ( 295 ) ( 296 ) Income/(loss) before income taxes $ 2,966 &#160; $ 1,708 &#160; $ 1,030 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense by segment was (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Depreciation and amortization expense: North America $ 579 &#160; $ 580 &#160; $ 644 &#160; International 259 &#160; 234 &#160; 221 &#160; General corporate expenses 95 &#160; 96 &#160; 104 &#160; Total depreciation and amortization expense $ 933 &#160; $ 910 &#160; $ 969 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal capital expenditures by segment were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Capital expenditures: North America $ 513 &#160; $ 477 &#160; $ 347 &#160; International 331 &#160; 348 &#160; 212 &#160; General corporate expenses 72 &#160; 80 &#160; 37 &#160; Total capital expenditures $ 916 &#160; $ 905 &#160; $ 596 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales by platform were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Taste Elevation $ 8,249 &#160; $ 7,267 &#160; $ 6,808 &#160; Fast Fresh Meals 6,064 &#160; 6,665 &#160; 6,819 &#160; Easy Meals Made Better 5,313 &#160; 4,927 &#160; 4,909 &#160; Real Food Snacking 1,375 &#160; 1,808 &#160; 2,296 &#160; Flavorful Hydration 1,999 &#160; 1,777 &#160; 1,648 &#160; Easy Indulgent Desserts 1,067 &#160; 1,034 &#160; 999 &#160; Other 2,418 &#160; 2,564 &#160; 2,706 &#160; Total net sales $ 26,485 &#160; $ 26,042 &#160; $ 26,185 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales by product category were (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Condiments and sauces $ 8,241 &#160; $ 7,302 &#160; $ 6,813 &#160; Cheese and dairy 3,976 &#160; 4,922 &#160; 5,131 &#160; Ambient foods 3,047 &#160; 2,896 &#160; 2,954 &#160; Frozen and chilled foods 2,922 &#160; 2,698 &#160; 2,599 &#160; Meats and seafood 2,733 &#160; 2,613 &#160; 2,515 &#160; Refreshment beverages 1,999 &#160; 1,786 &#160; 1,655 &#160; Coffee 903 &#160; 847 &#160; 1,062 &#160; Infant and nutrition 411 &#160; 441 &#160; 433 &#160; Desserts, toppings and baking 1,195 &#160; 1,157 &#160; 1,121 &#160; Nuts and salted snacks &#8212; &#160; 464 &#160; 1,047 &#160; Other 1,058 &#160; 916 &#160; 855 &#160; Total net sales $ 26,485 &#160; $ 26,042 &#160; $ 26,185 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nConcentration of Risk: \n\nOur largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21 % of our net sales in 2022 and approximately 22 % of our net sales in each of 2021 and 2020.

This change was primarily driven by a $ 79 million decrease in net pension and postretirement non-service benefits and a $ 25 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2022 compared to a $ 44 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2021. These impacts were partially offset by a $ 50 million net loss on derivative activities in 2022 compared to an $ 86 million net loss on derivative activities in 2021 and a $ 12 million increase in interest income as compared to the prior year period. \n\nOther expense/(income) was $ 295 million of income in 2021 compared to $ 296 million of income in 2020. This change was primarily driven by an $ 86 million net loss on derivative activities in 2021 compared to a $ 154 million net gain on derivative activities in 2020 and a $ 115 million decrease in non-cash amortization of postemployment benefit plans prior service credits as compared to the prior year period. These impacts were partially offset by a $ 101 million net foreign exchange gain in 2021 compared to a $ 162 million net foreign exchange loss in 2020, a $ 44 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2021 compared to a $ 2 million net loss on sales of businesses in 2020, and a $ 26 million loss on the dissolution of a joint venture in 2020. \n\n"

Controls and Procedures. \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 31, 2022, were effective and provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with other members of management, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. We determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that: \n\n&#8226; pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; \n\n&#8226; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; \n\n&#8226; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and \n\n&#8226; provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report which appears herein under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . \n\n"
