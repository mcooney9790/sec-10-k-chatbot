We have operations and offices located both within the United States (the &#8220;U.S.&#8221; or &#8220;domestic&#8221;) and outside of the U.S. (&#8220;international&#8221;) with revenues from domestic and international products and services as a percentage of total revenue as follows for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total revenue $ 17,737 $ 16,226 $ 14,852 Domestic 86 % 86 % 87 % International 14 % 14 % 13 % ##TABLE_END We have grown our business organically and through acquisitions, by signing new clients, expanding the products and services we provide to existing clients, offering new and enhanced products and services developed through innovation and acquisition, and extending our capabilities geographically, all of which have enabled us to deliver a wide range of integrated products and services and created new opportunities for growth.

We support a broad range of client-owned peripheral devices manufactured by a variety of vendors, which reduce a new client&#8217;s initial conversion expenses, enhance existing clients&#8217; ability to change technology and broaden our market opportunity. \n\nThe principal account processing solutions used by our depository institution clients are Cleartouch &#174; , DNA &#174; , Precision &#174; , Premier &#174; , Signature &#174; and Portico &#174; .

Our purpose is to deliver superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do. We are focused on operating businesses where we have: deep industry expertise that enables us to serve the market with high effectiveness; a strong competitive position, currently or via a clear path in the foreseeable future; long-term, trusted client relationships that are based on recurring services and transactions; differentiated solutions that deliver value to our clients through integration and innovation; and strong management to execute strategies in a disciplined manner. Consistent with this focus, we continue to operate our business in accordance with the following strategic framework: \n\n&#8226; Client Relationship Value . We plan to increase the number and breadth of our client relationships by, among other actions: continuing to integrate our products and services; introducing new products and services that are aligned with market needs; combining products and services to deliver enhanced, integrated value propositions; and delivering quality service and support for our clients. \n\n&#8226; Innovation . We seek to be an innovation leader, utilizing our assets and capabilities to be at the forefront of our industry and enable our clients to deliver best-in-class results. \n\n&#8226; Operational Effectiveness . We believe we can further improve the quality of our client delivery while reducing our costs by using the opportunities created by our size and scale. \n\n&#8226; Portfolio Management . We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale that enables competition and operational efficiency; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. \n\n&#8226; Capital Discipline . We intend to make capital allocation decisions that offer the best prospects for our long-term growth and profitability, which may include, among other matters: internal investment; repayment of debt; repurchases of our own shares; or acquisitions. \n\nServicing the Market \n\nThe financial technology industry is highly dynamic, with new innovations entering the market and driving the expectations of our clients globally. The markets for our solutions have specific needs and requirements, with strong emphasis placed by clients on quality, security, service reliability, timely introduction of new capabilities and features, flexibility and value. This requires us to continue our focus on product and service delivery, integration and innovation to meet and exceed the specific needs of our clients. We believe that our financial strength and specialized market knowledge enable us to support our clients to meet their changing preferences. In addition, we believe that our focus on quality, innovation, client service and our commitment of substantial resources to training and technical support helps us to identify and fulfill the needs of our clients. \n\nProduct Development \n\nTo meet the changing technology needs of our clients, we continually develop, maintain and enhance our products and systems. Our development and technology operations apply the expertise of multiple teams to design, develop and maintain specialized products and processing systems. Our products and solutions are designed to meet the preferences and diverse requirements of the international, national, regional or local market-specific merchant and financial services environments of our clients. In developing our products, we use current software development principles, such as service-oriented architecture, to create efficiencies, and we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients. \n\nResources \n\nOur business depends on a variety of resources to operate including products and services provided to us by third parties. For example, we rely on our human capital resources for product development (including product design and coding), sales, operations (including customer service, technology support, security and compliance) and management; access to financial and telecommunication networks; computers, servers, mainframes, microchips and other computer equipment; and Clover and other POS devices. We periodically review our resource requirements and sources, as well as our relationships with key vendors, to best meet the needs of our business including global sourcing efforts and alternate supplier resourcing. We believe we have access to the resources necessary for our current business needs. More information regarding supply chain risks can be found under the heading &#8220;Competitive and Business Risks &#8221; in the Risk Factors section of this report and our human capital resources can be found below under the heading &#8220;Human Capital.&#8221; \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nWe regard our software, transaction processing services and related products as proprietary, and we use a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, internal security practices, employee confidentiality and assignment agreements, and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property assets. Our patents cover innovations relating to numerous financial software and hardware products and services, and we continue, where appropriate, to seek and secure patents with respect to our ongoing innovations. We believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe market for technology products and services in the industries we serve is fragmented, highly competitive, and served by a multitude of large and small businesses. Our principal competitors include other large, integrated providers of financial services technology and payment systems, data processing affiliates of large companies, processing centers owned or operated as user cooperatives, financial institutions, merchant acquirers, ISOs, ISVs, payments companies and payment network operators. Our competitors also include global and local IT product and services companies and payment service providers and processors. We expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand or consolidate their product lines and services. Some of these competitors possess substantial financial, sales and marketing resources and can compete with us in various ways, including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing and long-standing relationships. Depending on the product or service, competitive factors may include quality, security, innovation, breadth or novelty of features and functionality, client satisfaction, market opportunity, integration, reliability, agility, global reach, multiple distribution channels, service reliability and performance standards, timely introduction of new products and features, platform scalability and flexibility, and value. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Additional information about competition in our segments is provided below. \n\nAcceptance \n\nOur Acceptance segment competes with merchant acquirers and financial institutions that provide acquiring and processing services to businesses on their own. In many cases, our alliance and commercial partners, such as ISOs and ISVs, compete against each other. We also compete with merchant services providers and, in a number of countries outside of the U.S., our Acceptance segment competes with a growing number of local and regional providers. In addition, payment networks and large technology, media and other integrated payments software providers are increasingly offering products and services that compete with our suite of merchant acquiring solutions. \n\nFintech \n\nOur products and services in the Fintech segment compete with large, diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products. Existing and potential financial institution clients may also develop and use their own in-house systems. In addition, we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions. \n\nPayments \n\nThe businesses in our Payments segment primarily compete with businesses that offer consumer payment solutions and a number of payment and card issuer processors. In addition to traditional payments competitors, large technology, media and other emerging financial technology providers are increasingly seeking to provide alternative payment and financing solutions. Existing and potential financial institution and other corporate clients could also develop and use their own in-house systems or custom-designed solutions instead of our products and services. \n\nGovernment Regulation \n\nOur operations, and the products and services that we offer, are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the U.S. We are also subject to non-government-issued rules and requirements, such as those promulgated by various payment networks. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of service and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. We may also be required, among other things, to make significant additional investments to comply with rules and regulations, to modify our products or services or the manner in which they are provided, or to limit or change the amount or types of revenue we are able to generate. \n\nFinancial Institution Regulations. Because a number of our businesses provide services to regulated financial institutions, we are subject to examination by the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;). The FFIEC is a formal interagency body empowered to examine significant service providers to financial institutions. The member agencies of the \n\nFFIEC include the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which is empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, &#8220;federal consumer financial laws,&#8221; some of which apply to products and services offered by our clients. We are also subject to examination by the first three of these agencies which refer to themselves as the Federal Banking Agencies when acting together. We also have a subsidiary that engages in trust activities and is subject to regulation, examination and oversight by the Division of Banking of the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. \n\nIn the U.S., we are also subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which, among other things, caps debit interchange rates for certain card issuers; prohibits debit payment card networks from restricting card issuers from contracting with other payment card networks; prohibits card issuers and payment networks from restricting the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions; requires all debit card issuers in the U.S. to participate in at least two unaffiliated debit payment card networks; and generally prohibits network exclusivity arrangements for prepaid card and healthcare debit card issuers. These regulations impact our card processing businesses and our clients&#8217; ability to generate revenue. \n\nCertain of our subsidiaries hold payment institution or electronic money licenses. These subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight in the jurisdictions in which they operate, and may be required to meet minimum capital maintenance requirements or other obligations. In addition, several of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. provide services such as merchant terminal leasing, debit processing, acquiring, issuing, factoring and settlement that make them subject to regulation by financial services supervisory agencies, including the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), the Federal Financial Supervision Agency in Germany, the National Bank of Poland, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Central Bank of Brazil and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. \n\nAssociation and Network Rules. We are subject to rules of Mastercard, Visa, INTERAC, PULSE and other payment networks. In order to provide processing services, a number of our subsidiaries are registered with Visa and/or Mastercard as service providers for member institutions. A number of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are direct members or associate members of Visa and Mastercard for purposes of conducting merchant acquiring. Various subsidiaries are also processor level members of numerous debit and electronic benefits transaction networks or are otherwise subject to various network rules in connection with processing services and other services we provide. As such, we are subject to applicable card association, network and national scheme rules that could subject us to fines or penalties. We are subject to network operating rules promulgated by Nacha relating to payment transactions processed by us using the ACH network and to various federal and state laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions. \n\nPrivacy and Information Security Regulations. We provide services that are subject to various federal, state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, as well as association and network privacy rules, which govern, among other things, the collection, processing, storage, deletion, use and disclosure of personal information. These laws and rules contain a variety of obligations including the safeguarding of personal information, the provision of notices and use and disclosure rights. The regulations and rules are complex and evolving and can provide for significant penalties or the suspension or termination of our registrations or certifications for non-compliance. \n\nIn the U.S., we are subject to various federal and state privacy and security laws. The U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) requires financial institutions to explain their information sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data. We are subject to the GLBA and have privacy and security obligations to our clients who are regulated by the GLBA. The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) governs the use and disclosure of protected health information in healthcare treatment, payment and operations by covered entities. We are also subject to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission Act, which empowers the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) to prohibit unfair and deceptive privacy practices. In addition to the FTC Act, the FTC is also responsible for overseeing and enforcing the privacy provisions over certain aspects of the GLBA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (&#8220;FCRA&#8221;), each of which is applicable to our businesses in certain circumstances. \n\nWe have obligations under state laws, such as the California Privacy Rights Act, which gives California consumers more control over the personal information businesses hold about them, as both a &#8220;business&#8221; and as a &#8220;service provider.&#8221; In addition, Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have passed comprehensive privacy acts that govern the personal data of their residents. We are also subject to the separate security breach notification laws of each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n\nIn the European Union (&#8220;E.U.&#8221;) and the U.K., we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), which impose a comprehensive approach to personal data protection and include penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of 20 million Euro or four percent of a company&#8217;s consolidated global revenue. There are numerous additional privacy laws and \n\nregulations that apply to our businesses around the world which also provide for significant penalties. Some of these data protection laws, including in the E.U., India, United Arab Emirates and China, impose requirements regarding data rights and security and either prohibit the international transfer of personal data or restrict such transfers absent lawfully recognized transfer mechanisms. \n\nMoney Transmission and Payment Instrument Licensing and Regulations. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment instruments, including some of our prepaid products. In the U.S., most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations. Many states require money transmitters, issuers of payment instruments and their agents to comply with federal and state anti-money laundering laws and regulations and often require the licensee to maintain certain levels of net worth. \n\nCredit Reporting and Debt Collections Regulations. TeleCheck, our check acceptance business, is subject to FCRA and various similar state laws. The collection business within our subsidiary TRS Recovery Services, Inc. (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) is subject to the U.S. federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various similar state laws. TRS maintains licenses in a number of states in order to engage in collection in those states. TeleCheck and TRS are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination from the CFPB. In addition, several of our subsidiaries are subject to comparable local laws regarding collection activities and obtaining credit reports and our U.K. branch described above also holds FCA permissions for debt collection activities. \n\nUnfair Trade Practice Regulations. We and our clients are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices. Various regulatory enforcement agencies, including the FTC and state attorneys general, have authority to take action against parties that engage in unfair or deceptive trade practices or violate other laws, rules and regulations. If we process payments for a merchant or other client in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions and incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business. \n\nAnti-Money Laundering, Anti-Bribery, and Sanctions Regulations. We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act (the &#8220;BSA&#8221;). Among other things, the BSA requires money services businesses (such as money transmitters, issuers of money orders and official checks, and providers of prepaid access) to develop and implement anti-money laundering programs. Our acquiring businesses outside the U.S. are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations in the countries where they operate. Our Money Network Financial, LLC subsidiary provides prepaid access for various open loop prepaid programs for which it is the program manager and therefore must meet the requirements of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. \n\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) and similar laws outside of the U.S. such as the U.K. Bribery Act, that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures. The FCPA has a broad reach and requires maintenance of appropriate records and adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. \n\nWe are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries, governments, individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Other group entities may be subject to additional local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions. \n\nSimilar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to OFAC lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process. Our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations. \n\nCommunications Laws. We are subject to various federal and state laws that govern telephone calls and the issuance of text messages to clients and consumers in the U.S. as well as to regulations that impose requirements on marketing emails sent to U.S residents. Our international subsidiaries are subject to equivalent laws in applicable jurisdictions. \n\nIndirect Regulatory Requirements. A number of our clients are subject to various regulations and compliance obligations that do not apply directly to us but impact the services that we provide to our clients. To remain competitive, we have expended, and expect to expend in the future, significant resources to develop and update our products and services to assist our clients to meet various compliance obligations. In addition, independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients and their auditors. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists the Board of Directors in establishing our compensation philosophy and strategy and overseeing our human capital management strategy which includes maintaining a culture committed to attracting, developing and retaining top talent, supporting diversity and inclusion, fostering innovation, and promoting employee engagement, safety and well-being. \n\nDevelopment and Retention \n\nWe are committed to creating a high-performance culture that consistently delivers excellence for our clients and long-term value for our shareholders while providing a workplace experience for our employees that values collaboration, innovation and diversity. Career development and internal mobility are important aspects of our value proposition for employees. We provide employees with numerous training and development opportunities, including through an e-learning platform specifically geared toward global technology associates; our Leading Women program, designed to accelerate the professional growth of female top talent across each of our global regions; our Leading Fiserv program, designed to develop critical leadership skills for frontline managers; our Vision to Results leadership program, focused on driving enterprise goals; and an online learning platform that provides global access to over 25,000 courses. Internal mobility is our primary approach for filling open positions and fostering career advancement for our employees. In an effort to further encourage internal mobility, we launched a global awareness campaign intended to create a sustainable internal talent pipeline while increasing associate retention, job satisfaction and personal and professional growth opportunities. \n\nWe have adopted a pay-for-performance philosophy that is designed to recognize performance and reward achievement of our strategic business objectives and financial results. Total compensation consists of a competitive base pay and annual incentive opportunity delivered in a mix of cash and equity that is designed to promote retention and reward the attainment of defined performance goals. We are committed to providing fair pay to our employees regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or any other protected characteristic, and we conduct periodic pay audits to track, measure and evaluate employee compensation. In addition, throughout the year, we celebrate employee contributions and achievements through a peer-based global recognition program that enables recognition and financial rewards. \n\nDiversity and Inclusion \n\nWe are committed to cultivating a diverse, respectful and inclusive workplace by: \n\n&#8226; Advancing diversity at all levels in the organization, including increasing the representation of women and minorities in leadership positions, requiring consideration of diverse candidates for our Board of Directors and senior leadership positions, dedicating talent acquisition resources focused on hiring diverse individuals, providing career opportunities to the military community, and deepening relationships with historically black colleges and universities, industry networks, and military and veterans&#8217; organizations that provide access to underrepresented populations; and \n\n&#8226; Promoting employee awareness through education and participation in diversity and inclusion programs, such as our inclusive leader assessment and coaching program, to develop the competencies necessary to create an inclusive workplace; eight Employee Resource Groups (&#8220;ERGs&#8221;) with over 6,500 associate members who support each other and mutually elevate professional development; and a host of diversity and inclusion training courses available to all employees. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had over 41,000 employees worldwide, approximately 41% of whom were female. In the U.S., approximately 37% of our employees self-identified as racially/ethnically diverse. \n\nWe continue to focus on our efforts on supporting our community with several initiatives, including: \n\n&#8226; Investing in small, minority-owned businesses by providing financial support, business expertise, and leading technology solutions, as well as through strategic partnerships and community engagement; and \n\n&#8226; Strengthening partnerships with organizations focused on human rights, racial equity and social justice, including through work by our ERGs with over 100 community organizations and groups. \n\nEmployee Engagement \n\nWe value employee engagement and feedback. Throughout the year, we engage with our employees through events such as lunch-and-learns, quarterly all-hands meetings, town halls, leadership meetings and other forums. We encourage managers to meet regularly with their teams and encourage skip-level discussions. \n\nTo assess employee engagement, we periodically collect employee feedback through employee engagement surveys, including annual enterprise-wide surveys and issue-specific surveys. These surveys cover a variety of topics, such as engagement, well-being, client experience, communication, teamwork, manager effectiveness, trust and diversity and inclusion. In addition to assessing engagement, the survey results enable us to gain insight into employee perspectives and issues which we use to enhance processes, set priorities and respond to associate concerns. \n\nSafety and Well-Being \n\nWe are committed to the safety of our workforce and maintain a global safety program that is designed to protect the safety and well-being of our employees in the workplace, minimize injury and accident frequency and severity, minimize loss to property, equipment and operational disruption, and enable greater associate satisfaction and productivity. \n\nWe are also committed to providing comprehensive and competitive benefits to our associates that are responsive to their physical, financial, social and emotional needs. Our benefit offerings include a variety of medical and dental plan choices, mental health and counseling programs, caregiver support programs, enhanced family forming and planning resources, and paid time off. Significantly, we have not increased the cost of health care benefits for our employees in the past two years despite the increased cost of such benefits to the company. Investing in our associates in this way helps us retain top talent and demonstrates our commitment to our employees, our most important asset. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nOur website address is www.fiserv.com.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and you may lose all or part of your investment. \n\nCompetitive and Business Risks \n\nWe operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively. \n\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors. Our principal competitors include other vendors and providers of financial services technology and payment systems, data processing affiliates of large companies, processing centers owned or operated as user cooperatives, financial institutions, independent sales organizations (&#8220;ISOs&#8221;), independent software vendors, payments companies and payment network operators. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. Many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications in-house. As a result, we may compete against our existing or potential clients&#8217; in-house capabilities. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new technologies and well-funded competitors, including large technology, telecommunication, media and other companies not historically in the financial services and payments industries, start-ups and international providers of products and services similar to ours. In addition, participants in the financial services, payments and technology industries may merge, create joint ventures or engage in other business combinations, alliances and consolidations that may strengthen their existing products and services or create new products and services that compete with ours. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nIf we fail to keep pace with technological change, we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients, and our ability to grow may be limited. \n\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by constant and rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent introduction of new products and services, and increasing client expectations. Our ability to respond timely to these changes, including by enhancing our current products and services and developing and introducing new products and services, will significantly affect our future success. In addition, the success of certain of our products and services rely, in part, on financial institutions, business partners and other third parties promoting the use of or distributing our products and services. If we are unsuccessful in developing, marketing and selling products or services that gain market acceptance, or if third parties \n\ninsufficiently promote or distribute our products and services, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients, to attract new ones and to grow profitably. \n\nIf we are unable to renew contracts on favorable terms or if contracts are terminated prematurely, we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. \n\nFailure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business. At the end of the contract term, clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services or to perform the services in-house. Some of our competitors may offer more attractive prices, features or other services that we do not offer, and some clients may desire to perform the services themselves. Larger clients may be able to seek lower prices from us when they renew or extend a contract or the client&#8217;s business has significant volume changes. In addition, larger clients may reduce the services we provide if they decide to move services in-house. Further, our small merchant business clients may seek reduced fees due to pricing competition, their own financial condition or pressure from their customers. \n\nWe also have contracts with U.S. federal, state and local governments. The contracts with these clients may contain terms that are not typical for non-government clients, such as the right to terminate for convenience, the right to unilaterally modify or reduce work to be provided under the contract, significant or unlimited indemnification obligations and being subject to appropriation of funds for the government contract program. In addition, if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, we could be suspended or debarred from contracting with that entity in the future, which could also provide other government clients the right to terminate. \n\nThese factors could result in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our agreement with that client. If we are not successful in achieving high contract renewal rates and favorable contract terms, if contracts are terminated, or if we are prevented from performing work for these clients in the future, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur business depends, in part, on our merchant relationships and alliances, and if we are unable to maintain these relationships and alliances, our business may be adversely affected. \n\nUnder our alliance program, a bank or other institution forms an alliance with us, generally on an exclusive basis, either contractually or through a separate legal entity. Merchant contracts may be contributed to the alliance by us and/or the bank or institution. The banks and other institutions generally provide card association sponsorship, clearing and settlement services and typically act as a merchant referral source when the institution has an existing banking or other relationship with such merchant. We provide transaction processing and related functions to the alliance. Both we and our alliance partners may also provide management, sales, marketing and other administrative services. The alliance structure allows us to be the processor for multiple financial institutions, any one of which may be selected by the merchant as its bank partner. Our merchant acquiring business depends, in part, on our merchant relationships, alliances and other distribution channels. There can be no guarantee that we will achieve growth in our merchant relationships, alliances or other distribution channels. In addition, our contractual arrangements with merchants and merchant alliance partners are for fixed terms and may allow for early termination upon the occurrence of certain events. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our contractual arrangements with these merchants or merchant alliance partners on similar terms or at all. The loss of merchant relationships or alliance partners could negatively impact our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on our business and may amplify many of our other known risks. \n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the related government actions taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have increased economic uncertainty and financial market volatility and caused a decline in consumer and business confidence, and could further negatively impact the demand for our products and services, including merchant acquiring and payment processing. Ultimately, the extent of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on, among other matters, the duration and intensity of the pandemic; the level of success of global vaccination efforts; governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us; and the impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients, vendors, supply chain, operations and sales, all of which are uncertain, difficult to predict and may remain prevalent for a significant period of time even after the pandemic subsides. These and other potential negative impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten or exacerbate the other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nChanges in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations. \n\nFrom time to time, card associations and debit networks, including the card networks which we own and operate, increase the processing and other fees (including what is commonly called &#8220;interchange fees&#8221;) that they charge. It is possible that competitive and other pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, or not being able to increase our own fees, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin, limit our growth, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. Any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes. \n\nConsolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients. \n\nMergers, consolidations and failures of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients, which could adversely affect our revenue. If our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. Our alliance strategy could also be negatively affected by consolidations, especially where the financial institutions involved are committed to their internal merchant processing businesses that compete with us. It is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have an increased ability to negotiate terms with us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOperational and Security Risks \n\nSecurity incidents or other technological risks involving our systems and data, or those of our clients, partners or vendors, could expose us to liability or damage our reputation. \n\nOur operations depend on receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, our employees, our clients and their customers. Under the card network rules, various federal, state and international laws, and client contracts, we are responsible for information provided to us by financial institutions, merchants, ISOs, third-party service providers and others. Preserving the confidentiality of sensitive business and personal information is critical to our business. Any unauthorized access, intrusion, infiltration, network disruption, ransom, denial of service or similar incident could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or data, or the systems or data of our clients, partners or vendors. These incidents are often difficult to detect and are constantly evolving. We expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, and those of our clients, partners and vendors, through various means and with increasing sophistication, particularly as cybercriminals attempt to profit from increased online banking, e-commerce and other online activity. These events could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, increased regulatory scrutiny, financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, we expect to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and that none of the events that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, we cannot be certain that the security measures and procedures we have in place to detect security incidents and protect sensitive data, including protection against unauthorized access and use by our employees, will be successful or sufficient to counter all current and emerging risks and threats. The impact of a material event involving our systems and data, or those of our clients, partners or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOperational failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our products or services could harm our business and reputation. \n\nOur business depends heavily on the reliability of our systems. An operational failure that results in an interruption in the availability of our products and services could harm our business or cause us to lose clients. An operational failure could involve the hardware, software, data, networks or systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and could be caused by our actions, the actions of third parties or events over which we may have limited or no control. Events that could cause operational failures include, but are not limited to, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, ransomware, denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, pandemics, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. In the event of operational failures or damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully or quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program. Implementation delays, interruptions of service or hardware device defects could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses, including those related to the payment of service credits, product recalls or other liabilities. A prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a \n\nreduction in revenue, and significantly impact our clients&#8217; businesses and the customers they serve. In addition, a significant interruption of service or product recall could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider. As a provider of payments solutions and other financial services, clients, regulators and others may require enhanced business continuity and disaster recovery plans including frequent testing of such plans. Meeting these various requirements may require a significant investment of time and money. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nDisruptions of operations of other participants in the global financial system could prevent us from delivering our products and services. \n\nThe operations and systems of many participants in the global financial system are interconnected. Many of the transactions involving our products and services rely on multiple participants in the global financial system to move funds and communicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain. A disruption for any reason of the operations of a participant in the global financial system could impact our ability to obtain or provide information or cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our products and services. Although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions, there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective. Such a disruption could lead to our inability to deliver products and services, reputational damage, lost clients and revenue, loss of clients&#8217; and their customers&#8217; confidence, as well as additional costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe rely on third parties to provide products and services and if we are unable to obtain such products or services in the future or if these third parties fail to perform these services adequately , our business may be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe rely on third parties we do not control to provide us with products and services, including payment card networks, acquiring processors, payment card issuers, financial institutions and the Automated Clearing House (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) network which transmit transaction data, process chargebacks and refunds, and perform clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. If, for example, such third parties stop providing clearing services or limit our volumes, we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services. In the event these third parties fail to provide these services adequately or in a timely manner, including as a result of errors in their systems or events beyond their control, or refuse to provide these services on terms acceptable to us or at all, and we are not able to find timely suitable alternatives, we may no longer be able to provide certain services to customers, which could expose us and our clients to information security, financial, compliance and reputational risks. We may be negatively impacted by a disruption to our supply chain or third-party delivery service providers, including if the factories that manufacture our point-of-sale devices, payment cards or computer chips for payment cards, or paper stock are temporarily closed or experience workforce shortages; shipping services are interrupted or delayed; there are increased lead times, shortages or higher costs for certain materials and components; or there are workforce shortages at our third-party customer support, software development or technology hosting facilities. If we are unable to renew our existing contracts with key vendors and service providers, we might not be able to replace the related product or service at all or at the same cost. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe may experience software defects, development delays or installation difficulties, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability. \n\nOur services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services. Further, the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. We may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems or with other programs used by our clients. Defects in our software, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients or client data, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability. \n\nGlobal Market Risks \n\nOur business may be adversely affected by geopolitical and other risks associated with operations outside of the U.S. and, as we continue to expand internationally, we may incur higher than anticipated costs and may become more susceptible to these risks. \n\nWe offer merchant acquiring, processing and issuing services outside of the U.S., including in the U.K., Germany, Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, India and Brazil. Our facilities outside of the U.S., and those of our suppliers and vendors, including manufacturing, customer support, software development and technology hosting facilities, are subject to risks, including natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, terrorism, war (such as the war in Ukraine), political instability and other events \n\noutside of our or our suppliers&#8217; control. As we continue to expand internationally and grow our client base outside of the U.S., we may face challenges due to the presence of more established competitors and our relative lack of experience in such non-U.S. markets, and we may incur higher than anticipated costs. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with the international operation and expansion of our business, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. \n\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by U.S. and global market and economic conditions. \n\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to derive revenue primarily from products and services we provide to the financial services industry and from our merchant acquiring business. Given this focus, we are exposed to global economic conditions and adverse economic trends may accelerate the timing, or increase the impact of, risks to our financial performance. Such trends may include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; inflation, foreign currency fluctuations, declining economies, social unrest, natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors, on which a significant portion of our revenues are dependent; \n\n&#8226; low levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high inflation and/or unemployment, may cause decreased spending by cardholders; \n\n&#8226; budgetary concerns in the U.S. and other countries around the world could affect the U.S. and other specific sovereign credit ratings, impact consumer confidence and spending, and increase the risks of operating in those countries; \n\n&#8226; emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in the U.S. and Europe, and adverse economic trends, including high rates of inflation, may be more pronounced in such emerging markets; \n\n&#8226; financial institutions may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate cardholder defaults; \n\n&#8226; uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients&#8217; businesses may make estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives, and realization of prepaid assets less predictable; \n\n&#8226; our clients may decrease spending for value-added services; and \n\n&#8226; government intervention, including the effect of laws, regulations, treaties and/or government investments in our clients, may have potential negative effects on our business, operations and our relationships with our clients or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products. \n\nA further weakening in the economy or competition from other retailers could also force some retailers to close, resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and declines in transactions, and reduced earnings on transactions due to a potential shift to large discount merchants. Additionally, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices. \n\nA prolonged poor economic environment, including a potential recession in the U.S. or other economies in which our business operates, could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process or accounts we service, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nIn Europe, we are continuing to assess the implications of the U.K. leaving the E.U. (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;). We cannot predict the impact that Brexit, including any future trade agreements, divergence in law or currency fluctuations, will have on our business and our clients, and it is possible that it may adversely affect our operations and financial results. \n\nPotential tariffs or trade wars could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products and our financial results. \n\nThe U.S. has imposed tariffs on certain imports from China, including on some of our hardware devices manufactured in China. If the U.S. administration imposes additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the U.S. or other countries, our hardware devices produced in China could be impacted. Although it is difficult to predict how current or future tariffs on items imported from China or elsewhere will impact our business, the cost of our products manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. or other countries could increase, which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks \n\nIf we or third parties with whom we partner or contract fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liability and our business could be harmed. \n\nIf we or third parties with whom we partner or contract fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business, including state and federal payment, cybersecurity, consumer protection, trade and data privacy laws and regulations, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed, and our ability to obtain new clients could be inhibited, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our clients are also subject to numerous laws and regulations applicable to banks, financial institutions and card issuers in the U.S. and abroad, and, consequently, we are at times affected by these federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws, regulations and interpretations are regularly adopted. \n\nCertain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters and are required, among other matters, to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports. Our direct-to-consumer payments businesses are subject to state and federal regulations in the U.S., including state money transmission regulations, anti-money laundering regulations, economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Asset Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) and certain privacy regulations, such as the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Our Money Network Financial, LLC subsidiary must meet the requirements of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network because it is the program manager for various prepaid card programs. We operate businesses that are subject to credit reporting and debt collection laws and regulations in the U.S. and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to privacy, anti-money laundering, debt collection, and payment institution or electronic money licensing regulations outside the U.S. \n\nWe operate our business around the world, including in certain foreign countries with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws applicable to us, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. These laws prohibit, among other things, improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We also derive revenue from transactions involving sales to U.S. federal, state and local governments and their respective agencies, and are subject to various procurement laws, regulations, and contract provisions relating to those contracts. We have implemented policies and training programs to comply with applicable laws, regulations and obligations; however, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants and agents will comply with our policies and all applicable laws and any noncompliance could subject us to fines, penalties and loss of business. \n\nWe are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs, including those that are administered by OFAC, which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries, their governments, individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists equivalent to OFAC lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process. Our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations. \n\nThe volume and complexity of the regulations that impact our business, directly or indirectly, will continue to increase our cost of doing business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes in the regulatory environment, including changing interpretations and the implementation of new, varying or more restrictive laws and regulations by federal, state, local or foreign governments, may result in significant financial penalties, reputational harm, suspension or termination of our ability to provide certain services, or change or restrict the manner in which we currently conduct our business, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nIf we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks and Nacha, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nIn order to provide our transaction processing services, several of our subsidiaries are registered with Visa and Mastercard and other networks as members or service providers for member institutions. A number of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are direct members or associate members of Visa and Mastercard for purposes of conducting merchant acquiring, and various subsidiaries are also processor level members of numerous debit and electronic benefits transaction networks. As such, we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our clients to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us, acquiring clients, processing clients or merchants. In addition, we are subject to Nacha rules relating to payment transactions processed by us using the ACH network and to various federal and state laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions, as well as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard enforced by the major card brands. The rules of Nacha and the card \n\nnetworks are set by their respective boards, some of which are our competitors, and the card network rules may be influenced by card issuers, some of which offer competing transaction processing services. \n\nIf we fail to comply with these rules, we could be fined and our member registrations or certifications could be suspended or terminated. The suspension or termination of our member registrations or certifications, or any changes to the association and network rules, that we do not successfully address, or any other action by the card networks to restrict our ability to process transactions over such networks, could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation, which, in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nA heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business. \n\nSince the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), a number of substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the U.S. have been adopted, including those that establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to, and conducts direct examinations of, &#8220;supervised banks and nonbanks&#8221; as well as &#8220;supervised service providers&#8221; like us. CFPB rules, examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs. Changes to the Dodd-Frank Act or regulations could adversely impact our debit network business. In addition, certain of our alliance partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authorities and, as a result, could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us. \n\nAdditional regulation, examination or oversight of our business could require us to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients; directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services; require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such oversight and regulations, including in respect of audits, investigations or enforcement actions related to us or third parties; or limit our ability to update our existing products and services, or require us to develop new ones. If this oversight or regulation negatively impacts the business, operations or financial condition of our clients, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because, among other matters, our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us, could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business, or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions. Any of these events, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results. \n\nCybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) extends the scope of the E.U. data protection law to all companies processing data of individuals within the E.U., regardless of the company&#8217;s location, subject to certain limitations. The law requires companies to meet stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data. E.U. data protection law continuously develops and requires significant changes to our policies and procedures. For example, in 2020, the Court of Justice of the E.U. issued a decision that invalidated the European Commission&#8217;s adequacy decision for the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and placed additional safeguards necessary for transfers of personal data to the U.S., requiring companies and regulators to conduct case-by-case analyses to determine whether foreign protections concerning government access to transferred data meet E.U. standards. Together with our vendors and clients, we have been directly impacted by this decision, and our ability to transfer data outside the E.U. may be further impacted by determinations made by regulators in the E.U. We are also subject to U.K. GDPR following the U.K.&#8217;s exit from the E.U. Single Market and Customs Union. Our efforts to comply with E.U., U.K. and other privacy and data protection laws around the world that apply to our businesses could involve substantial expenses, divert resources from other initiatives and projects and limit the services we are able to offer. There is also increased focus on data localization requirements around the world in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, China and India which could impact our business model with respect to our storage and transfer of personal data. Failure to comply with applicable laws in this area could also result in significant fines, penalties and reputational damage. \n\nIn addition, U.S. banking agencies have adopted or proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our financial institution clients and that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. Several states also have adopted or proposed new privacy and cybersecurity laws targeting these issues. Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization may compel us to enhance or modify our systems, invest in new systems or alter our business practices or our policies on data governance and privacy. If any of these outcomes were to occur, our operational costs could increase significantly. \n\nFailure to comply with state and federal antitrust requirements could adversely affect our business. \n\nThrough our merchant alliances, we hold an ownership interest in several competing merchant acquiring businesses while serving as an electronic processor for those businesses. In order to satisfy state and federal antitrust requirements, we actively maintain an antitrust compliance program. Notwithstanding our compliance program, it is possible that perceived or actual violations of state or federal antitrust requirements could give rise to regulatory enforcement investigations or actions. Regulatory scrutiny of, or regulatory enforcement action in connection with, compliance with state and federal antitrust requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. \n\nWe may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others. \n\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We expose ourselves to additional liability when we agree to defend or indemnify our clients against third-party infringement claims. If the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are, or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is, infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or services, and such changes may be expensive or impractical, or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights. If we are unable to agree on acceptable terms, we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations. We may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights, and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them. Any adverse result related to violation of third-party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit, they may result in costly and time-consuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel. \n\nMisappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position. \n\nOur ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology. We actively seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Nevertheless, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology. Agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy. It is also possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology. Further, we use open source software in connection with our solutions. Companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of solutions developed using open source software. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available. The laws of certain non-U.S. countries where we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nChanges in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows from operations. \n\nOur operations are subject to tax by federal, state, local, and international taxing jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations in our significant tax jurisdictions could materially increase the amount of taxes we owe, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations. Additionally, future tax laws, regulations or guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board could cause us to adjust current estimates in future periods, which could impact our earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. \n\nThe U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the &#8220;OECD&#8221;) and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we do business remain focused on the taxation of multinational corporations. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, including the U.S., is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles, including ensuring all companies pay a global minimum tax and expanding taxing rights of market countries. Because the timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted will vary among participating countries, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of these initiatives and their implementation could adversely affect our business or financial results. \n\nFurthermore, our implementation of new practices and processes designed to comply with changing tax laws and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nUnfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows from operations. \n\nOur tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations. We have established contingency reserves for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. These reserves reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority. While we believe that the reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there is no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost not in excess of any related reserve. An unfavorable resolution, therefore, could negatively impact our effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in the current and/or future periods. \n\nOrganizational and Financial Risks \n\nThe failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nWe depend on the experience, skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees. If we fail to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management, technical, compliance and sales personnel, our future success could be harmed. Our senior management provides strategic direction for our company, and if we lose members of our leadership team, our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss. Our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry, applicable regulatory and industry requirements, computer systems, and software applications, and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel, we could suffer delays in new product development, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients&#8217; demands. \n\nLosses due to chargebacks, refunds or returns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe may be liable if our merchants or other parties that have obligations to deliver goods or services to cardholders fail to satisfy their obligations. For example, we and our merchant acquiring alliances may be subject to contingent liability for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants or other parties. These disputes could arise from fraud, misuse, unintentional use, settlement delay or failure, insufficiency of funds, returns, a failure to perform a service, or other reasons. If we or the alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant or other party because of the merchant&#8217;s or other party&#8217;s insolvency or other reasons, we or the alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. Although we have an active program to manage our credit risk, and often mitigate our risk by obtaining collateral, a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business, and results of operations and financial condition. \n\nAdditionally, we may be subject to potential liability for fraudulent transactions, including electronic payment and card transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. Examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit, debit or prepaid card, card number or other credentials to record a false sales transaction, processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud. We also rely on ISOs to sell our merchant processing services, which they may do by contracting with their own sub-ISOs. We rely on these ISOs and sub-ISOs to exercise appropriate controls to avoid fraudulent transactions. It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud, or otherwise effectively administer our chargeback responsibilities, would increase our chargeback liability and expose us to fines or other liabilities. Increases in chargebacks, fines or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nAcquisitions subject us to risks, including assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations. \n\nA major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses, products and services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future, which could adversely affect our future growth; or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult or expensive to integrate and manage than expected, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together. In addition, the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources. \n\nIn addition, acquisitions outside of the U.S. often involve additional or increased risks including, for example: \n\n&#8226; managing geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities; \n\n&#8226; integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures; \n\n&#8226; complying with non-U.S. regulatory requirements; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; \n\n&#8226; enforcement of intellectual property rights in some non-U.S. countries; \n\n&#8226; difficulty entering new non-U.S. markets due to, among other things, consumer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets; and \n\n&#8226; general economic and political conditions. \n\nThese risks may arise for a number of reasons: we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms; we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers; we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us; changes in accounting, tax, securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions; we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions; we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business; we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition; we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience; and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges. \n\nWe may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements. \n\nWe have in the past and may in the future sell businesses. In connection with sales of businesses, we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale. Our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations. \n\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 59% of our total assets at December 31, 2022. These assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill. In addition, we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a non-cash charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations. \n\nExisting or future leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had approximately $21.4 billion of debt. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could: decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes; limit our flexibility to make acquisitions; increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, if certain of our outstanding senior notes or commercial paper notes are downgraded to below investment grade, we may incur additional interest expense. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements, including due to further deterioration in economic and market conditions, we may be required, among other things: to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms. \n\nAn increase in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. \n\nCertain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, term loan, foreign lines of credit and commercial paper programs, are at variable rates of interest. During 2022, interest rates increased significantly and interest rates may continue to increase or remain at higher than recent historical levels in the future. An increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $4.0 billion in variable rate debt, which includes $200 million on our term loan, $233 million drawn on our revolving credit facility and foreign lines of credit, and an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion outstanding under our U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs. Based on outstanding debt balances and interest rates at December 31, 2022, a 1% increase in variable interest rates would result in an increase to annual interest expense of $40 million. \n\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nWe are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenues and profit generated by such international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and other hedging instruments to mitigate the market value risks associated with foreign currency-denominated transactions and investments. These hedging strategies may not, however, eliminate all of the risks related to foreign currency translation, and we may forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if currency exchange rates were to change in our favor. We have also issued foreign currency-denominated senior notes and commercial paper notes for which payments of interest and principal are to be made in foreign currency, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could cause the expense associated with such payments to increase. In addition, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign revenue currencies into U.S. dollars. Any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues and earnings we derive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\n"

We provide account processing and digital banking solutions; card issuer processing and network services; payments; e-commerce; merchant acquiring and processing; and the Clover &#174; cloud-based point-of-sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) and business management platform. Our operations are comprised of the Merchant Acceptance (&#8220;Acceptance&#8221;) segment, the Financial Technology (&#8220;Fintech&#8221;) segment and the Payments and Network (&#8220;Payments&#8221;) segment. \n\nThe businesses in our Acceptance segment provide a wide range of commerce-enabling solutions and serve merchants of all sizes around the world. These solutions include POS merchant acquiring and digital commerce services; mobile payment services; security and fraud protection products; Clover, our cloud-based POS and integrated commerce operating system for small and mid-sized businesses (&#8220;SMBs&#8221;) and independent software vendors (&#8220;ISVs&#8221;); and Carat SM , our integrated operating system for large businesses. We distribute the products and services in the Acceptance segment businesses through a variety of channels, including direct sales teams, strategic partnerships with agent sales forces, ISVs, financial institutions, and other strategic partners in the form of joint venture alliances, revenue sharing alliances, and referral agreements. Merchants, financial institutions and distribution partners in the Acceptance segment are frequently clients of our other segments. \n\nThe businesses in our Fintech segment provide financial institutions around the world with technology solutions they need to run their operations, including products and services that enable financial institutions to process customer deposit and loan accounts and manage an institution&#8217;s general ledger and central information files. As a complement to the core account processing functionality, the Fintech segment businesses also provide digital banking, financial and risk management, professional services and consulting, item processing and source capture, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Certain of the businesses in the Fintech segment provide products or services to corporate clients to facilitate the management of financial processes and transactions. Many of the products and services offered in the Fintech segment are integrated with products and services provided by our other segments. \n\nThe businesses in the Payments segment provide financial institutions, corporate clients and the public sector with the products and services required to process digital payment transactions. This includes card transactions such as debit, credit and prepaid card processing and services; a range of network services, security and fraud protection products; and card production and print services. In addition, the Payments segment businesses offer non-card digital payment software and services, including bill payment, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payments, electronic billing, and security and fraud protection products. Clients of the Payments segment businesses reflect a wide range of industries around the world, including merchants, distribution partners and financial institution customers in our other segments. \n\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts that generally have high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide within our segments are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. \n\nCorporate and Other supports the reportable segments described above, and consists of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, unallocated corporate expenses and other activities that are not considered when we evaluate segment performance, such as gains or losses on sales of businesses, certain assets or investments; costs associated with acquisition and divestiture activity; certain services revenue associated with various dispositions; and our Output Solutions postage reimbursements. \n\nAcquisitions and Dispositions \n\nWe frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the necessary business assets to execute our strategy. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; an opportunity to change industry dynamics; a way to achieve business scale that enables competition and operational efficiency; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. The results of operations for the following acquired and divested businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition and through the respective dates of disposition. \n\nAcquisitions \n\nOn December 29, 2022, we acquired OrangeData S.A.

We acquired these businesses in 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of $882 million, net of $43 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions at an aggregate fair value of $34 million. \n\nDispositions \n\nOn October 17, 2022, we sold Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and our Systems Integration Services (&#8220;SIS&#8221;) operations, which provides information technology engineering services in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and India, to a single buyer. Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and SIS were reported primarily within our Fintech segment. On September 30, 2022, we sold our Korea operations, which were reported within our Acceptance segment. We sold these operations for total consideration of $99 million and recognized an aggregate net pre-tax loss on the sales of $83 million. These divestitures were the result of a strategic review of our business portfolio. \n\nWe mutually agreed with a minority partner to terminate one of our merchant alliance joint ventures effective March 2022. In conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain merchant contracts of the joint venture for $175 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $137 million. \n\nEnterprise Priorities \n\nWe aspire to move money and information in a way that moves the world. Our purpose is to deliver superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do. We are focused on driving growth and creating value by assembling a high-performing and diverse team, integrating our solutions, delivering operational excellence, allocating capital in a disciplined manner, including share repurchase and merger and acquisition activity, and delivering breakthrough innovation. Our long-term priorities are to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our financial commitments; deepen client relationships with an emphasis on digital channels and payment solutions; deliver innovation and integration enabling differentiated value for our clients; and generate integration value, including cost and revenue synergies from acquisitions. \n\nIndustry Trends \n\nThe global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and real-time payments infrastructure. Because of this growth, competition also continues to intensify. Business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on speed, convenience, choice and security. To meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience. \n\nMerchants \n\nThe rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers&#8217; desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers nearly anywhere, through any device, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. Merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and flexible systems to accept payments and help manage their everyday business operations. When combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern systems to streamline the complexity. Furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new system through direct, digital-only experiences. This direct, digital-only channel is a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants. \n\nAdditionally, there are numerous software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) solution providers in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring into their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships. Such providers are typically referred to as ISVs, and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us. \n\nWe believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants, and across all verticals. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of financial and non-financial institutions of all sizes, gives us a solid foundation for growth. \n\nFinancial Institutions and Other Financial Technology Providers \n\nFinancial services providers regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions and other financial technology providers continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. In addition, the focus on the customer experience, including through mobile and online engagement, by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. \n\nWe expect that financial institutions and other financial technology providers will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including a unified, seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. \n\nThe number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations transfer accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we typically receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. These fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. Furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. \n\nRecent Market Conditions \n\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, disruptions in the global supply chain, the effects of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the continuing impact of the coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic, and regulations restricting trade or that impact our ability to offer products or services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, since 2021, we have observed increased shortages and delays in the global supply chain for components and inputs necessary to our businesses, such as semiconductors, paper and plastic, and may experience difficulty procuring those components and inputs in the future on a timely basis or at historical prices. For discussion of risks related to potential impacts of supply chain, geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges on our business, results of operations and financial condition, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. \n\nAcquisitions \n\nFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. The determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additional information regarding our acquisitions is included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nWe review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is one level below our reportable segments. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the prior test&#8217;s amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit&#8217;s last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and \n\nother events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test. \n\nThe quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. \n\nOur most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2022 determined that our goodwill of $36.8 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values. However, for four of our reporting units, with aggregate goodwill of $10.9 billion, the excess of the respective reporting unit&#8217;s fair value over carrying value ranged from 7 to 18 percent. If future operating performance is below our expectations or there are material changes to forecasted revenue growth rates or operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates, effective income tax rates, or some combination thereof, a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in, and we may be required to record, a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, a significant change in a merchant alliance business relationship or operating performance could result in a material goodwill impairment charge. It is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the interest rate environment, a shift in strategic initiatives, or significant changes in the composition of certain of our reporting units could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment. We have no accumulated goodwill impairment through December 31, 2022. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nWe review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date. Recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. Determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below. \n\nProcessing and Services \n\nProcessing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, merchant transaction processing and acquiring, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit/credit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support. \n\nWe recognize processing and services revenue in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services, which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. Our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when- and if-needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. These services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. Fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis. \n\nProduct \n\nProduct revenue is generated from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily POS devices) sales. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. For arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. We sell or lease hardware (POS devices) and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers. Hardware typically consists of terminals or Clover devices. We do not manufacture hardware, rather we purchase hardware from third-party vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. We account for the sale of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at the standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware. \n\nSignificant Judgments \n\nWe use the following methods, inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, if the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. \n\nTechnology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. Whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances, including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, to determine whether we obtain control of goods and services prior to their transfer to a customer. \n\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. The transaction price (including any discounts or rebates) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service. \n\nContract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract, or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation. Additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management&#8217;s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, sometimes made more complex by our global footprint. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. In establishing a liability for known tax exposures, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. A tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits, considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. The amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we \n\nbelieve is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority. As additional information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate. \n\nWe maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions, resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies. However, there could be a material impact to our effective income tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment. To the extent our judgment changes, the valuation allowances are then adjusted, generally through the provision for income taxes, in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs. Additional information regarding our income taxes is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nComponents of Revenue and Expenses \n\nThe following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. \n\nProcessing and Services \n\nProcessing and services revenue, which represented 82% of our total revenue in 2022, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services consists of costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; certain depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. \n\nProduct \n\nProduct revenue, which represented 18% of our total revenue in 2022, is derived from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily POS devices) sales. Cost of product consists of costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and postage; software development; hardware costs (primarily POS devices); personnel; infrastructure costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; third-party commissions; advertising and promotional costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. \n\nFinancial Results \n\nThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year.

The revenue increase was driven by higher processing revenue and product sales across all of our business segments, partially offset by a 2% decrease due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nRevenue in our Acceptance segment increased $813 million, or 13%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase was driven by higher global merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes, an increase in the number of active merchants on our Clover operating system and the expansion of our merchant relationships through value-added services. The revenue growth of our Clover and Carat operating systems were above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels and contributed 5% and 1%, respectively, to Acceptance segment growth. The remaining revenue growth in our Acceptance segment was attributable to higher merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes across our other merchant acquiring platforms. \n\nRevenue in our Fintech segment increased $148 million, or 5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase was driven by both higher processing revenue and license and termination fee revenue across our Fintech businesses, with each contributing approximately 2% to Fintech revenue growth. \n\nRevenue in our Payments segment increased $429 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase was driven by our debit processing business, which contributed 3% to Payments segment revenue growth through new client wins on our network routing services; our Output Solutions business, which contributed 2%, primarily driven by new client growth; and our credit processing business, which contributed 1%, primarily driven by an increase in active accounts. \n\nRevenue at Corporate and Other increased $121 million, or 14%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increased postage revenue. \n\nTotal Expenses \n\nTotal expenses in 2022 were relatively consistent compared to 2021. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 700 basis points to 78.9% in 2022 compared to 2021. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were favorably impacted in 2022 by a reduction of approximately 390 basis points in acquisition and integration related expense and approximately 90 basis points in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2022 were also favorably impacted by operating leverage, along with a pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets of $54 million. \n\nCost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 39.9% in 2022 compared to 45.7% in 2021. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in 2022 by approximately 330 basis points from a reduction in acquisition and integration related expenses, as well as strong operating leverage across our businesses, and partially offset by an increase in severance costs of approximately 50 basis points in 2022. \n\nCost of product as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 67.8% in 2022 compared to 70.0% in 2021. The cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2022 as a result of higher margin revenue growth. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 34.2% in 2022 compared to 35.8% in 2021. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2022 was primarily due to a reduction in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately 100 basis points. \n\nThe net gain on sale of businesses and other assets in 2022 included a $137 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain merchant contracts in conjunction with the mutual termination of one of our merchant alliance joint ventures and a $44 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and our SIS operations. These gains were partially offset by a $127 million pre-tax loss from the sale of our Korea operations. \n\nOperating Income and Operating Margin \n\nTotal operating income increased $1,452 million, or 63%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Total operating margin increased 700 basis points to 21.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. Total operating income and total operating margin benefited from revenue growth in 2022, along with a reduction in acquisition and integration related expenses. Total operating income and total operating margin were also favorably impacted by a $54 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets in 2022, partially offset by an increase in severance costs of approximately $130 million. \n\nOperating income in our Acceptance segment increased $325 million, or 16%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 31.8% in 2022 compared to 2021. Operating margin growth in 2022 was primarily due to operating leverage and the divestiture of a lower-margin business within the Acceptance segment. \n\nOperating income in our Fintech segment increased $76 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 36.5% in 2022 compared to 2021. Fintech segment operating income and margin growth in 2022 was due to an increase in license and termination fee revenue. \n\nOperating income in our Payments segment increased $266 million, or 10%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 45.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. Payments segment operating income and margin growth in 2022 was primarily due to scalable revenue growth from our debit and credit processing businesses. \n\nThe operating loss in Corporate and Other decreased $785 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Corporate and Other was favorably impacted by a reduction of approximately $850 million in acquisition and integration related costs and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The operating loss in 2022 also included a $54 million pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets and approximately $130 million of increased severance costs. \n\nInterest Expense, Net \n\nInterest expense, net increased $40 million, or 6%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding borrowings. \n\nOther (Expense) Income \n\nOther expense increased $165 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Other (expense) income includes net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains or losses from a change in fair value of investments in certain equity securities, and amounts related to debt guarantee arrangements of certain joint ventures. Net foreign currency transaction (losses) gains were $(62) million and $12 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other expense in 2022 also includes net pre-tax expense of $48 million associated with joint venture debt guarantees. Other income in 2021 included $12 million related to a pre-tax gain on the remeasurement of a previously held investment in Ondot to fair value upon acquiring the remaining ownership interest in the entity. \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\nIncome tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes and income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 18.9% and 21.8% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of $134 million of income tax expense in 2021 attributed to the revaluation of certain net deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangible assets and investments in joint ventures recognized at fair value in connection with the acquisition of First Data Corporation, reflecting the effect of enacted corporate income tax rate changes in the United Kingdom (tax rate increase from 19% to 25% starting in 2023) and Argentina (tax rate increase from 25% to 35%). \n\nIncome from Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates \n\nOur share of net income from affiliates accounted for using the equity method is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $220 million and $100 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2022 includes pre-tax gains totaling $209 million, primarily related to the acquisition-date fair value remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in Finxact of $110 million, as well as $80 million resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in conjunction with the Sagent M&#38;C, LLC transaction with a third party. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2021 included a $33 million pre-tax gain resulting from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in InvestCloud Holdings, LLC (&#8220;InvestCloud&#8221;), as well as a $28 million pre-tax gain resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in connection with the Tegra118 merger with a third party. \n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to the minority partners&#8217; share of the net income in our consolidated subsidiaries. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $52 million and $69 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nNet Income Per Share - Diluted \n\nNet income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted was $3.91 and $1.99 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted in 2021 included $134 million of certain discrete tax expenses discussed above, as well as higher acquisition and integration related expenses. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nGeneral \n\nOur primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance leases; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short and long term using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $902 million, proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper, and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $870 million (net of outstanding borrowings and $5.1 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, senior notes due in 2023 and letters of credit) at December 31, 2022. \n\nThe following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively: ##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (In millions) 2022 2021 $ % Net income $ 2,582 $ 1,403 $ 1,179 Depreciation and amortization 3,212 3,248 (36) Share-based compensation 323 239 84 Deferred income taxes (558) (262) (296) Net gain on sale of businesses and other assets (54) &#8212; (54) Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates (220) (100) (120) Distributions from unconsolidated affiliates 73 34 39 Non-cash impairment charges 14 15 (1) Net changes in working capital and other (754) (543) (211) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,618 $ 4,034 $ 584 14 % Capital expenditures, including capitalized software and other intangibles \n\n$ 1,479 $ 1,160 $ 319 28 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOur operating cash flow was $4.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 14% compared with $4.0 billion in 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results, partially offset by higher working capital use compared to the prior year, including increased accounts receivable corresponding to revenue growth and slower customer payments, as well as an increase in future credit card receivables purchased under our Clover Capital program. \n\nWe maintain investments in various affiliates that are accounted for as equity method investments. Total distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, including those classified as cash flows from investing activities, were $211 million and $149 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nOur current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 8% and 7% of our total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nCash Requirements \n\nThe following table details our future cash requirements under certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years \n\nLong-term debt including interest (1) (2) \n\n$ 26,206 $ 950 $ 5,155 $ 9,705 $ 10,396 \n\nMinimum finance lease payments (1) \n\n576 183 272 120 1 \n\nMinimum operating lease payments (1) (2) \n\n868 141 220 175 332 \n\nPurchase obligations (1) \n\n1,727 683 715 209 120 Income tax obligations 96 10 36 41 9 Total $ 29,473 $ 1,967 $ 6,398 $ 10,250 $ 10,858 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Interest, finance lease, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis. \n\n(2) The calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, except for our 0.375% Euro-denominated senior notes due in July 2023, 3.800% senior notes due in October 2023, and U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper notes programs as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis through the issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we have the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility maturing in June 2027. The variable rate on the revolving credit facility and term loans are priced at the rate in effect at December 31, 2022. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nWe repurchased $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion (including the repurchase described below) of our common stock in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 16.9 million shares remaining under our then existing repurchase authorization. On February 22, 2023, our board of directors approved a repurchase authorization for an additional 75.0 million shares. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. \n\nIn 2021, New Omaha Holdings L.P. (&#8220;New Omaha&#8221;), a shareholder of ours, completed an underwritten secondary public offering of 23.0 million shares of our common stock (the &#8220;offering&#8221;). We repurchased from the underwriters 5.0 million shares of our common stock that were subject to the offering. The share repurchase totaled $588 million and was funded with cash on hand. The repurchased shares were cancelled and no longer outstanding following the completion of the share repurchase. \n\nAcquisitions and Dispositions \n\nAcquisitions \n\nWe acquired Yacar&#233; and Merchant One in December 2022, NexTable in September 2022 and City POS in June 2022. Additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in Finxact in April 2022, in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $994 million, net of $28 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $6 million. We funded these acquisitions in 2022 by utilizing a combination of available cash and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. \n\nWe acquired BentoBox in November 2021, AIP in October 2021, SpendLabs in June 2021, Pineapple Payments in May 2021, and Radius8 in March 2021. Additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in NetPay in November 2021 and a remaining ownership interest in Ondot in January 2021, in which we previously held noncontrolling equity interests. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $882 million, net of $43 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions at an aggregate fair value of $34 million. We funded these acquisitions in 2021 by utilizing a combination of available cash, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and existing availability under our revolving credit facility. \n\nThe results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition. \n\nDispositions \n\nWe sold Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and our SIS operations in October 2022 and our Korea operations in September 2022 for aggregate net cash proceeds of $77 million, along with a minority noncontrolling equity interest in the buyer of the Korea operations. Effective March 2022, we mutually agreed to terminate a merchant alliance joint venture with a minority partner. In conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain additional merchant contracts of the joint venture for cash proceeds of $175 million. The net proceeds from these dispositions were primarily used to pay down indebtedness and repurchase shares of our common stock. \n\nWe previously maintained a noncontrolling interest in Tegra118, LLC (&#8220;Tegra118&#8221;) which was accounted for under the equity method. In February 2021, Tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest in the combined new entity, Wealthtech Holdings, LLC, which was subsequently renamed as InvestCloud. In connection with the transaction, we made an additional capital contribution, funded under our revolving credit facility, of $200 million into the combined entity and, in June 2021, we sold our entire ownership interest in InvestCloud for $466 million. The net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our term loan facility. \n\nIndebtedness \n\nOur debt consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Short-term and current maturities of long-term debt: Foreign lines of credit $ 198 $ 240 Finance lease and other financing obligations 270 268 Total short-term and current maturities of long-term debt $ 468 $ 508 Long-term debt: 3.500% senior notes due October 2022 $ &#8212; $ 700 0.375% senior notes due July 2023 (Euro-denominated) 531 566 3.800% senior notes due October 2023 1,000 1,000 2.750% senior notes due July 2024 2,000 2,000 3.850% senior notes due June 2025 900 900 2.250% senior notes due July 2025 (British Pound-denominated) 632 705 3.200% senior notes due July 2026 2,000 2,000 2.250% senior notes due June 2027 1,000 1,000 1.125% senior notes due July 2027 (Euro-denominated) 531 566 4.200% senior notes due October 2028 1,000 1,000 3.500% senior notes due July 2029 3,000 3,000 2.650% senior notes due June 2030 1,000 1,000 1.625% senior notes due July 2030 (Euro-denominated) 531 566 3.000% senior notes due July 2031 (British Pound-denominated) 632 705 4.400% senior notes due July 2049 2,000 2,000 U.S. dollar commercial paper notes 2,329 916 Euro commercial paper notes 1,210 905 Revolving credit facility 35 97 Receivable securitized loan &#8212; 500 Term loan facility 200 200 Unamortized discount and deferred financing costs (120) (125) Finance lease and other financing obligations 539 528 Total long-term debt $ 20,950 $ 20,729 ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our debt consisted primarily of $16.8 billion of fixed-rate senior notes and $3.5 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs. Interest on our U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our Euro and British Pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. Interest on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper notes is generally paid weekly, or more frequently on occasion, and interest on our term loan is paid monthly. Outstanding borrowings under our 0.375% Euro-denominated senior notes due in July 2023, 3.800% senior notes due in October 2023, and U.S dollar and Euro commercial paper programs are classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we also have the ability to refinance such borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as further discussed below. \n\nIn July 2022, we redeemed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 3.500% senior notes due in October 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We financed the redemption of these notes using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper. We also repaid $485 million, representing all amounts outstanding on our receivable securitized loan, in July 2022, using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper and terminated the underlying receivables financing agreement. \n\nIn June 2022, we entered into a new senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility with substantially the same syndicate of banks that were lenders under our prior amended and restated revolving credit facility, which we voluntarily terminated and replaced. The new credit agreement matures in June 2027 and provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount of availability of $6.0 billion. \n\nVariable Rate Debt \n\nOur variable rate debt consisted of the following at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Maturity Weighted-Average Interest Rate Outstanding Borrowings Foreign lines of credit n/a 30.58% $ 198 U.S. dollar commercial paper notes various 4.82% 2,329 Euro commercial paper notes various 1.92% 1,210 Revolving credit facility June 2027 5.44% 35 Term loan facility July 2024 5.64% 200 Total variable rate debt 5.27% $ 3,972 ##TABLE_END\n\nWe maintain certain short-term lines of credit with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund settlement activity associated with international operations in Latin America. We maintain U.S. dollar and Euro unsecured commercial paper programs with various maturities generally ranging from one day to four months. Outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs bear interest based on the prevailing rates at the time of issuance. In August 2022, we increased our U.S. commercial paper program borrowing capacity to $6.0 billion to align with the maximum amount of availability under our revolving credit facility. \n\nAs discussed above, we maintain a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments available for $6.0 billion of total capacity. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) or a base rate in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. We are required to pay a facility fee based on the aggregate commitments in effect under the credit agreement from time to time. \n\nWe maintain a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. Outstanding borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on one-month LIBOR or a base rate, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. \n\nDebt Covenants and Compliance \n\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable maturity date. \n\nThe new revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.75 times our consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions. \n\nThe term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.5 times our EBITDA during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) maintain EBITDA of at least 3.0 times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. Our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. We expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants. \n\nDebt Guarantees \n\nWe maintain noncontrolling ownership interests in Sagent M&#38;C, LLC and defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC (collectively, the &#8220;Lending Joint Ventures&#8221;). The Lending Joint Ventures maintain, as amended in April 2022, variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $437 million in senior unsecured debt at December 31, 2022 and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $83 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in April 2027. There were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2022. We have guaranteed the debt of the Lending Joint Ventures and do not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. We maintained a liability of $40 million at December 31, 2022 for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements. Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term of the debt. In addition, we maintained a contingent liability of $21 million at December 31, 2022, representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. This contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so. \n\nOther \n\nAccess to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance maturing debt and fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) on our senior unsecured debt securities. As of December 31, 2022, we had a commercial paper credit rating of P-2 from Moody&#8217;s and A-2 from S&#38;P. \n\nThe interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes, term loan and commercial paper notes programs are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody&#8217;s or S&#38;P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody&#8217;s or S&#38;P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates on certain senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nInvestments, exclusive of settlement assets, with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents as reflected within our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held $902 million and $835 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. \n\nThe table below details the cash and cash equivalents at December 31: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 (In millions) Domestic International Total Domestic International Total Available $ 135 $ 153 $ 288 $ 180 $ 221 $ 401 \n\nUnavailable (1) \n\n436 \n\n614 138 296 434 Total $ 313 $ 589 $ 902 $ 318 $ 517 $ 835 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents cash held by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors of the relevant entity declares a dividend, as well as cash held by other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements. \n\nEmployee Termination Costs \n\nWe recorded $187 million and $95 million of employee termination costs related to cash severance and other separation costs for terminated employees during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Employee termination costs include those charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of First Data Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2021. The employee severance and other separation costs accrued balance of $23 million at December 31, 2022 is expected to be paid within the next twelve months. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. Our senior management actively monitors certain market risks to which we are exposed, primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to limit our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative instruments with creditworthy institutions to hedge against changing interest rates and foreign currency rate fluctuations. We currently utilize forward exchange contracts, fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swap contracts and other non-derivative hedging instruments to manage risk. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nIn addition to existing cash and cash equivalents balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use a combination of fixed- and variable-rate debt instruments to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. We had fixed- and variable-rate debt, excluding finance leases and other financing obligations, with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $16.8 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. Our fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of fixed-rate senior notes with a fair value of $15.2 billion, based on matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs of comparable securities. The potential change in fair value of our fixed-rate senior notes from a hypothetical 1% change in market interest rates would not alone impact any decisions to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate debt instruments before their maturity. Our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of outstanding U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper and borrowings on our variable rate term loan and foreign lines of credit. Based on our outstanding debt balances and interest rates at December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 1% increase in market interest rates related to our variable-rate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately $40 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes the outstanding debt balances at December 31, 2022 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year. \n\nIn connection with processing electronic payments transactions, funds received from subscribers are invested into short-term, highly liquid investments from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. Fluctuations in market interest rates affect the interest-related income that we earn on these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the amount of such interest-related income was not material and, therefore, a hypothetical 1% decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on such income. This sensitivity analysis assumes the subscriber fund balances at December 31, 2022 and the change in market interest rates is applicable for an entire year. \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\nWe conduct business globally and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar-denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions. We manage the exposure to these risks through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swap contracts and non-derivative net investment hedges. Translation gains and losses from non-U.S. subsidiaries are generally reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders&#8217; equity on the consolidated balance sheets. For subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, the financial statements are remeasured into U.S. dollars, and the foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements of income, rather than in shareholders&#8217; equity. The remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities resulted in foreign currency exchange losses of $52 million and $5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to Argentina. \n\nOur exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arise from our non-U.S. operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Approximately 14% of our total revenue was generated outside the U.S in each of 2022 and 2021. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Indian Rupee. A strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which our revenue and profits are denominated by 10% would have resulted in a decrease or increase, respectively, in our reported pre-tax income as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START \n\n( In millions ) \n\n2022 2021 Argentine Peso $ 5 $ 4 Brazilian Real 5 6 British Pound 1 5 Canadian Dollar 5 4 Euro 7 16 Indian Rupee 5 3 Other &#8212; 1 Total increase or decrease $ 28 $ 39 ##TABLE_END\n\nWe maintain foreign currency forward exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure to the Indian Rupee. At December 31, 2022, the notional amount of these derivatives was $346 million, with a fair value of $(8) million. In addition, we maintain fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Euro. At December 31, 2022, aggregate notional cross-currency rate swaps of 400 million Euro were designated as net investment hedges. We also designated our Euro- and British Pound-denominated senior notes and Euro commercial paper notes as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Euro and British Pound. \n\n"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nDescription of the Business \n\nFiserv, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) provide payments and financial services technology solutions to clients worldwide. The Company provides account processing and digital banking solutions; card issuer processing and network services; payments; e-commerce; merchant acquiring and processing; and the Clover &#174; cloud-based point-of-sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) and business management platform. The Company serves clients around the globe, including merchants, banks, credit unions, other financial institutions and corporate clients. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments are Merchant Acceptance (&#8220;Acceptance&#8221;), Financial Technology (&#8220;Fintech&#8221;) and Payments and Network (&#8220;Payments&#8221;). \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fiserv, Inc. and its subsidiaries in which the Company holds a majority controlling financial interest. All intercompany transactions and balances between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Control is typically established when ownership and voting interests in an entity are greater than 50%. Investments in which the Company has significant influence but not control are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, for which the Company&#8217;s share of net income or loss is reported within income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and the related tax expense or benefit is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Significant influence over an affiliate&#8217;s operations generally coincides with an ownership interest of between 20% and 50%; however, for partnerships and limited liability companies, an ownership interest of between 3% and 50% or board of director representation may also constitute significant influence. \n\nThe Company maintains a majority controlling financial interest in certain entities, mostly related to consolidated merchant alliances (see Note 19). Noncontrolling interests represent the minority shareholders&#8217; share of the net income or loss and equity in consolidated subsidiaries. The Company&#8217;s noncontrolling interests presented in the consolidated statements of income include net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests are presented as a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the Company&#8217;s control are presented outside of equity and are carried at their estimated redemption value if it exceeds the initial carrying value of the redeemable interest (see Note 12). \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. \n\nSince the onset of the coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic in early 2020, global economic and market conditions have been negatively impacted, including levels of consumer and business spending. The Company&#8217;s operating performance, primarily within its merchant acquiring and payment-related businesses, which earn transaction-based fees, was adversely affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has determined, however, that there have been no material changes to the estimates and assumptions within its consolidated financial statements to date as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company will continue to monitor any future developments. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company generates revenue from the delivery of processing, service and product solutions. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer which may be at a point in time or over time. Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s revenue recognition policies is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of 90 days or less and are stated at cost in the consolidated balance sheets, which approximates market value. Cash and cash equivalents that were restricted from use due to regulatory or other requirements are included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash and cash \n\nequivalents held on behalf of merchants and other payees are included in settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The changes in settlement cash and cash equivalents are included in settlement activity, net within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of cash flows at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets \n\n$ 902 &#160; $ 835 &#160; $ 906 &#160; Cash and cash equivalents included in settlement assets (see Note 5) \n\n2,283 &#160; 2,361 &#160; 1,650 &#160; Other restricted cash 7 &#160; 9 &#160; 13 &#160; Total cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows \n\n$ 3,192 &#160; $ 3,205 &#160; $ 2,569 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nThe Company analyzes the collectability of trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, client creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in client payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 52 million and $ 55 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company maintains certain leasing receivables associated with its POS terminal leasing businesses. Leasing receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Interest income on the Company&#8217;s leasing receivables is recognized using the effective interest method, and is included within product revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Initial direct costs incurred to obtain operating leases and other sales-type leases, in which the fair value of the underlying asset is equal to its carrying amount at the lease commencement date, are deferred and recognized over the lease term. Initial direct costs to obtain a sales-type lease are expensed as incurred if the fair value of the underlying asset is different from its carrying amount at the lease commencement date. Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s lease policies is included in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets \n\nPrepaid expenses represent advance payments for goods and services to be consumed in the future, such as maintenance, postage and insurance, and totaled $ 431 million and $ 410 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Company offers merchants advance access to capital through its Clover Capital cash advance program. Under this program, merchants sell fixed amounts of their future credit card receivables to the Company in exchange for an up-front purchase price payment. Future credit card receivables purchased by the Company under the Clover Capital program were $ 164 million and $ 77 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company maintained a reserve of $ 7 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, based on an estimate of uncollectible amounts. \n\nSettlement Assets and Obligations \n\nSettlement assets and obligations result from timing differences between collection and fulfillment of payment transactions and collateral amounts held to manage merchant credit risk, primarily associated with the Company&#8217;s merchant acquiring services. Settlement assets represent cash received or amounts receivable from agents, payment networks, bank partners, merchants or direct consumers. Settlement obligations represent amounts payable to merchants and payees. Certain merchant settlement assets (included within settlement receivables) that relate to settlement obligations are held by partner banks to which the Company does not have legal ownership, but which the Company has the right to use, to satisfy the related settlement obligations. The Company records settlement obligations for amounts payable to merchants and for outstanding payment instruments issued to payees that have not yet been presented for settlement. Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s settlement assets and obligations is included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nAllowance for Merchant Credit Losses \n\nWith respect to the Company&#8217;s merchant acquiring business, the Company&#8217;s merchant customers have the legal obligation to refund any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. However, in the event the Company is not able to collect the refunded \n\namounts from the merchants, the Company may be liable for the reversed charges. The Company&#8217;s risk in this area primarily relates to situations where a cardholder has purchased goods or services to be delivered in the future. The Company requires cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants to mitigate this risk. Collateral held by the Company, or held by partner banks for the Company&#8217;s benefit, is classified within settlement assets and the obligation to repay the collateral is classified within settlement obligations in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also utilizes a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant credit risk. Despite these efforts, the Company experiences losses due to merchant defaults. \n\nThe aggregate merchant credit loss expense, recognized by the Company within cost of processing and services in the consolidated statements of income, was $ 62 million, $ 41 million and $ 113 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of collateral available to the Company was $ 1.5 billion and $ 2.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company maintains an allowance for merchant credit losses that are expected to exceed the amount of merchant collateral. The allowance includes estimated losses from anticipated chargebacks and fraud events that have been incurred on merchants&#8217; payment transactions that have been processed but not yet reported to the Company, which is recorded within accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as estimated losses on refunded amounts to cardholders that have not yet been collected from the merchants, which is recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance is based primarily on the Company&#8217;s historical experience of credit losses and other factors such as changes in economic conditions or increases in merchant fraud. The aggregate merchant credit loss allowance was $ 29 million and $ 42 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nProperty and Equipment \n\nProperty and equipment is reported at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the leasehold period, if applicable. Property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Estimated Useful Lives 2022 2021 Land &#8212; $ 47 &#160; $ 48 &#160; Data processing equipment 3 to 5 years \n\n3,025 &#160; 2,302 &#160; Buildings and leasehold improvements 5 to 40 years \n\n724 &#160; 512 &#160; Furniture and equipment 5 to 8 years \n\n370 &#160; 372 &#160; 4,166 &#160; 3,234 &#160; Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 2,208 ) ( 1,492 ) Total $ 1,958 &#160; $ 1,742 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nDepreciation expense for all property and equipment totaled $ 555 million, $ 498 million and $ 523 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively (see Note 16 for a description of accelerated depreciation under certain finance lease agreements). \n\nIntangible Assets \n\nCustomer related intangible assets represent customer contracts and relationships obtained as part of acquired businesses and are amortized using an accelerated amortization method which corresponds with the customer attrition rates used in the initial valuation of the intangibles over their estimated useful lives, generally ten to twenty years . Acquired software and technology represents software and technology intangible assets obtained as part of acquired businesses and is amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally four to ten years . Trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally eight to twenty years . Non-compete agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally four to five years . \n\nPurchased software represents software licenses purchased from third parties and is amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally five years . \n\nThe Company continually develops, maintains and enhances its products and systems. Product development expenditures represented approximately 7 %, 7 % and 6 % of the Company&#8217;s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Routine maintenance of software products, design costs and other development costs incurred prior to the \n\nestablishment of a product&#8217;s technological feasibility are also expensed as incurred. Costs are capitalized commencing when the technological feasibility of the software has been established. \n\nCapitalized software development costs represent the capitalization of certain costs incurred to develop new software or to enhance existing software which is marketed externally or utilized by the Company to process client transactions. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally five years . \n\nThe Company may, at its discretion, negotiate to pay an independent sales organization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) an agreed-upon up-front amount in exchange for the ISO&#8217;s surrender of its right to receive commission payments from the Company related to future transactions of merchants referred by the ISO (&#8220;residual buyout&#8221;). The amount that the Company pays for these residual buyouts is capitalized and subsequently amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the merchant portfolios, generally five to nine years . The Company may also obtain residual buyouts as part of acquired businesses. Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s identifiable intangible assets is included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company&#8217;s reportable segments. When assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company considers (i) the prior year&#8217;s amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, (ii) the period of time since a reporting unit&#8217;s last quantitative test, (iii) the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of the reporting units and (iv) other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, the Company assesses numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that the Company assesses include its share price, its financial performance, market and competitive factors in its industry and other events specific to its reporting units. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing reporting unit carrying values to estimated fair values. \n\nThe Company elected to perform a quantitative test for certain reporting units, including those that changed in composition or where the prior year&#8217;s amount of excess fair value over carrying value was of a lower magnitude, and tested the remainder of its reporting units using a qualitative approach. The Company&#8217;s most recent annual impairment assessment of its reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2022 determined that its goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying values. However, it is reasonably possible that future developments related to the interest or currency exchange rate environments; a shift in strategic initiatives; a deterioration in financial performance or in the success of merchant alliances and relationships within a particular reporting unit; or significant changes in the composition of, or assumptions used in, the quantitative test on certain of the Company&#8217;s reporting units (such as an increase in risk-adjusted discount rates) could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment. There is no accumulated goodwill impairment for the Company through December 31, 2022. Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s goodwill is included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nAsset Impairment \n\nThe Company reviews property and equipment, lease right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets, intangible assets and its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date. Recoverability of property and equipment, lease ROU assets, capitalized software development costs and other intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. The Company assesses lease ROU assets that are exited in advance of the non-cancellable lease terms by comparing the carrying values of the lease ROU assets to the discounted cash flows from estimated sublease payments. The Company&#8217;s investments in unconsolidated affiliates are assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the investments to their estimated fair values and are impaired if any decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Company applies fair value accounting for all assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value represents the amount that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company uses the hierarchy prescribed in Accounting \n\nStandards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 820, Fair Value Measurements (&#8220;ASC Topic 820&#8221;), and considers the principal or most advantageous market and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The three levels in the hierarchy are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible as of the measurement date. \n\n&#8226; Level 2 &#8211; Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly, including but not limited to quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates or yield curves. \n\n&#8226; Level 3 &#8211; Unobservable inputs reflecting management&#8217;s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. \n\nAdditional information regarding the Company&#8217;s fair value measurements is included in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses \n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Trade accounts payable $ 652 &#160; $ 593 &#160; Client deposits 871 &#160; 783 &#160; Accrued compensation and benefits 279 &#160; 392 &#160; Accrued taxes 432 &#160; 154 &#160; Accrued interest 216 &#160; 216 &#160; Other accrued expenses 1,433 &#160; 1,412 &#160; Total $ 3,883 &#160; $ 3,550 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nForeign Currency \n\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company&#8217;s U.S.-based businesses and certain foreign-based businesses. Where the functional currency differs from the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the reporting period. Gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income for the reporting period. \n\nFinancial statements of subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies outside of the U.S. are remeasured into U.S. dollars, and the foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements of income, rather than in shareholders&#8217; equity. The remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities resulted in foreign currency exchange losses of $ 52 million and $ 5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to Argentina. Foreign currency exchange losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities were no minal during the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\nTo reduce exposure to changes in the value of the Company&#8217;s net investments in certain of its foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swap contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt as economic hedges of its net investments in such foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries (see Note 13). Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the qualifying net investment hedge instruments are recorded as foreign currency translation, net of tax, within other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss within the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiaries. \n\nDerivatives \n\nDerivatives are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged item affects earnings. If the derivative is designated as a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative, net of tax, are recorded in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the sale or complete liquidation of the underlying net investment. If the derivative is \n\ndesignated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the same line item as the changes in the fair value of the hedged item and recognized in the consolidated statements of income. To the extent a derivative is not designated as a hedge, changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The Company&#8217;s policy is to enter into derivatives with creditworthy institutions and not to enter into such derivatives for speculative purposes. \n\nEmployee Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company maintains frozen defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in Europe and the U.S. The Company records actuarial gains/losses and prior service cost in the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes changes in these amounts during the year in which changes occur through other comprehensive income (loss). The Company uses various assumptions when computing amounts relating to its defined benefit pension plan obligations and their associated expenses (including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets). Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s employee benefit plans is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nCost of Processing, Services and Product \n\nCost of processing and services consists of costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; certain depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. \n\nCost of product consists of costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and postage; software development; hardware costs (primarily POS devices); personnel; infrastructure costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; third-party commissions; advertising and promotional costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. \n\nInterest Expense, Net \n\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense primarily associated with the Company&#8217;s outstanding borrowings and finance lease obligations, as well as interest income primarily associated with the Company&#8217;s investment securities. Interest expense, net consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense \n\n$ ( 746 ) $ ( 696 ) $ ( 716 ) Interest income \n\n13 &#160; 3 &#160; 7 &#160; Interest expense, net \n\n$ ( 733 ) $ ( 693 ) $ ( 709 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n\nLiabilities are established for unrecognized tax benefits, attributable to differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements. In establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. As additional information becomes available, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reevaluated and adjusted, as appropriate. Tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax. \n\nNet Income Per Share \n\nNet income per share attributable to Fiserv, Inc. in each year is calculated using actual, unrounded amounts. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock units and unvested restricted stock awards, and are computed using the treasury stock method. The Company excluded 1.7 million, 1.5 million and 1.3 million weighted-average shares from the calculations of common stock equivalents for anti-dilutive stock options in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The computation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Weighted-average common shares outstanding used for the calculation of net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share &#8211; basic 642.3 &#160; 662.6 &#160; 672.1 &#160; Common stock equivalents 5.6 &#160; 9.0 &#160; 11.3 &#160; Weighted-average common shares outstanding used for the calculation of net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share &#8211; diluted 647.9 &#160; 671.6 &#160; 683.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information ##TABLE_START (In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Interest paid $ 703 &#160; $ 648 &#160; $ 673 &#160; Income taxes paid 709 &#160; 666 &#160; 156 &#160; Treasury stock purchases settled after the balance sheet date 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nDistribution of nonmonetary assets (see Note 4) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 726 &#160; Software obtained under financing arrangements 104 &#160; 143 &#160; 308 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) (&#8220;ASU 2021-10&#8221;), which requires that an entity provide certain disclosures in its annual financial statements about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. ASU 2021-10 is effective for all business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to the transactions reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application. The Company adopted ASU 2021-10, with prospective application of the additional disclosures to the transactions reflected in its consolidated financial statements, for the year ending December 31, 2022. The adoption was not material and therefore did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statement disclosures. \n\nIn 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASU 2021-08&#8221;), which requires that an entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). Generally, this should result in recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities at carryover value consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquired company&#8217;s financial statements, providing consistent recognition and enhanced comparability with revenue contracts with customers not acquired in a business combination. Prior to adoption of ASU 2021-08, an acquirer generally recognized contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination at fair value on the acquisition date. For public entities, ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Entities are required to apply a prospective transition approach upon adoption, unless early adoption occurs in an interim period. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2022, with prospective application to business combinations occurring after adoption, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842): Lessors &#8211; Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments (&#8220;ASU 2021-05&#8221;), which amends the lease classification requirements for lessors with certain leases containing variable payments. A lessor is to classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate as an operating lease if the lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease and the lessor would have otherwise recognized a day-one loss. For public entities, ASU 2021-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Entities that have adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases (&#8220;ASC Topic 842&#8221;), prior to the issuance of ASU 2021-05 may apply this update either retrospectively to leases that commenced or were modified on or after the adoption of ASC Topic 842 or prospectively to leases that commence or are modified on or after the date the entity first applies ASU 2021-05. The Company adopted ASU 2021-05 effective January 1, 2022, with prospective application to leases commencing or modified thereafter, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) : Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (&#8220;ASU 2022-03&#8221;), which clarifies the guidance in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and introduces new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820. For public entities, ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The provisions within ASU 2022-03 are to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2022-03 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. \n\nIn 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (&#8220;ASU 2022-02&#8221;), which requires that entities disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. For public entities, the provisions within ASU 2022-02 are to be applied prospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt ASU 2022-02 and will include the additional disclosures, as applicable, for any write-offs reflected in its consolidated financial statements effective for the year ending December 31, 2023. \n\n3. Revenue Recognition \n\nSignificant Accounting Policy \n\nASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle, involving a five-step process, of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. \n\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling activities associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and recognized as revenue at the point in time at which control of the goods transfers to the customer. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. \n\nNature of Goods and Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are comprised of the Acceptance segment, the Fintech segment and the Payments segment (see Note 20). The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below. \n\nProcessing and Services \n\nProcessing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for merchant transaction processing and acquiring, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit/credit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support. \n\nThe Company recognizes processing and services revenue in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services in which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. The Company&#8217;s arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to its customers on a when and if needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. These services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. Fees for the Company&#8217;s processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis. \n\nProduct \n\nProduct revenue is generated from print and card production, software license, and hardware (primarily POS device) sales. \n\nFor software license agreements that are distinct, the Company recognizes software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. For arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. In certain instances, the Company may offer extended payment terms beyond one year. To the extent a significant financing component exists, it is calculated as the difference between the promised consideration and the present value of the software license fees utilizing a discount rate reflective of a separate financing transaction, and is recognized as interest income over the extended payment period. The cash selling price of the software license fee is recognized as revenue at the point in time when the software is transferred to the customer. \n\nThe Company sells or leases hardware (POS devices) and other peripherals as part of its contracts with customers. Hardware typically consists of POS terminals or Clover &#174; devices. The Company does not manufacture hardware; rather, it purchases hardware from third-party vendors and holds such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. The Company accounts for sales of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognizes the revenue at its standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware. \n\nSignificant Judgments in Application of the Guidance \n\nThe Company uses the following methods, inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize: \n\nIdentification of Performance Obligations \n\nTo identify its performance obligations, the Company considers all of the goods or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. For multi-element arrangements, the Company accounts for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. \n\nTechnology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with the Company&#8217;s applications or service offerings. Whether the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances, including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, to determine whether control of goods and services is obtained prior to their transfer to a customer. \n\nDetermination of Transaction Price \n\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. The Company includes any fixed charges within its contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, the Company includes an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and updates its assumptions over the duration of the contract. \n\nAssessment of Estimates of Variable Consideration \n\nMany of the Company&#8217;s contracts with customers contain some component of variable consideration; however, the constraint will generally not result in a reduction in the estimated transaction price for most forms of variable consideration. The Company may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which fees may be adjusted. \n\nAllocation of Transaction Price \n\nThe transaction price (including any discounts or rebates) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells each good or service. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount the Company expects to receive in exchange for the related good or service. \n\nContract Modifications \n\nContract modifications occur when the Company and its customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by the Company. When a contract modification occurs, it requires the Company to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of consideration to the remaining performance obligations and the period of revenue recognition for each identified performance obligation. \n\nDisaggregation of Revenue \n\nThe tables below present the Company&#8217;s revenue disaggregated by type of revenue, including a reconciliation with its reportable segments. The majority of the Company&#8217;s revenue is earned domestically, with revenue generated outside the U.S. comprising approximately 14 %, 14 % and 13 % of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ##TABLE_START (In millions) Reportable Segments \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 \n\nAcceptance Fintech Payments Corporate and Other Total Type of Revenue Processing $ 6,226 &#160; $ 1,608 &#160; $ 4,709 &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 12,565 &#160; \n\nHardware, print and card production \n\n918 &#160; 42 &#160; 1,036 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,996 &#160; \n\nProfessional services \n\n21 &#160; 484 &#160; 278 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 783 &#160; \n\nSoftware maintenance \n\n&#8212; &#160; 553 &#160; 24 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 577 &#160; \n\nLicense and termination fees \n\n69 &#160; 252 &#160; 114 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 435 &#160; \n\nOutput Solutions postage \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 989 &#160; 989 &#160; \n\nOther \n\n58 &#160; 231 &#160; 101 &#160; 2 &#160; 392 &#160; Total Revenue $ 7,292 &#160; $ 3,170 &#160; $ 6,262 &#160; $ 1,013 &#160; $ 17,737 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Reportable Segments \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nAcceptance Fintech Payments Corporate and Other Total \n\nType of Revenue \n\nProcessing \n\n$ 5,511 &#160; $ 1,544 &#160; $ 4,497 &#160; $ 32 &#160; $ 11,584 &#160; \n\nHardware, print and card production \n\n830 &#160; 44 &#160; 913 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,787 &#160; \n\nProfessional services \n\n43 &#160; 471 &#160; 265 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 779 &#160; \n\nSoftware maintenance \n\n&#8212; &#160; 557 &#160; 11 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 568 &#160; \n\nLicense and termination fees \n\n47 &#160; 186 &#160; 65 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 298 &#160; \n\nOutput Solutions postage \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 860 &#160; 860 &#160; Other 48 &#160; 220 &#160; 82 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 350 &#160; Total Revenue $ 6,479 &#160; $ 3,022 &#160; $ 5,833 &#160; $ 892 &#160; $ 16,226 &#160; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (In millions) Reportable Segments \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 \n\nAcceptance Fintech Payments Corporate and Other Total \n\nType of Revenue \n\nProcessing \n\n$ 4,696 &#160; $ 1,426 &#160; $ 4,348 &#160; $ 58 &#160; $ 10,528 &#160; \n\nHardware, print and card production \n\n714 &#160; 51 &#160; 771 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,536 &#160; \n\nProfessional services \n\n29 &#160; 465 &#160; 233 &#160; 1 &#160; 728 &#160; \n\nSoftware maintenance \n\n&#8212; &#160; 563 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; 568 &#160; \n\nLicense and termination fees \n\n28 &#160; 189 &#160; 68 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 285 &#160; \n\nOutput Solutions postage \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 864 &#160; 864 &#160; Other 55 &#160; 207 &#160; 81 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 343 &#160; Total Revenue $ 5,522 &#160; $ 2,901 &#160; $ 5,504 &#160; $ 925 &#160; $ 14,852 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nContract Balances \n\nThe following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Contract assets $ 551 &#160; $ 541 &#160; $ 433 &#160; Contract liabilities 860 &#160; 810 &#160; 733 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nContract assets, reported within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily result from revenue being recognized where payment is contingent upon the transfer of services to a customer over the contractual period. Contract liabilities primarily relate to advance consideration received from customers (deferred revenue) for which transfer of control occurs, and therefore revenue is recognized, as services are provided. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, contract assets and contract liabilities increased primarily due to customer discounts and deferred conversion revenue associated with long-term contracts obtained during the respective year. The Company recognized $ 585 million and $ 546 million of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the year. \n\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations \n\nThe following table includes estimated processing, services and product revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at December 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Year Ending December 31, 2023 $ 2,276 &#160; 2024 1,828 &#160; 2025 1,393 &#160; 2026 835 &#160; Thereafter 1,074 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company applies the optional exemption under ASC 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations for account- and transaction-based processing fees that qualify for recognition under the as-invoiced practical expedient. These multi-year contracts contain variable consideration for stand-ready performance obligations for which the exact quantity and mix of transactions to be processed are contingent upon the customer&#8217;s request. The Company also applies the optional exemptions under ASC 606 and does not disclose information for variable consideration that is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property or that is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service in a series. The amounts disclosed above as remaining performance obligations consist primarily of fixed or monthly minimum processing fees and maintenance fees under contracts with an original expected duration of greater than one year. \n\nContract Costs \n\nThe Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist of sales commissions incurred only if a contract is obtained, and customer conversion or implementation related costs. Capitalized sales commissions and conversion or implementation costs were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Capitalized sales commissions $ 485 &#160; $ 437 &#160; Capitalized conversion or implementation costs 420 &#160; 374 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCapitalized contract costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates. The amortization period also considers expected customer lives and whether the asset relates to goods or services transferred under a specific anticipated contract. The amortization of capitalized sales commissions is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of capitalized conversion or implementation costs within cost of processing and services. These costs totaled $ 173 million, $ 148 million and $ 124 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Impairment losses recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to capitalized contract costs were not significant. \n\n4. Acquisitions and Dispositions \n\nAcquisitions \n\nAcquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . Purchase price was allocated to the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values at the date of acquisitions. The results of operations for the following acquired and divested businesses are included in the consolidated results of the Company from the respective dates of acquisition and through the respective dates of disposition. Pro forma information for these acquired businesses is not provided because they did not have a material effect, individually or in aggregate, on the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations. \n\nAcquisition of Merchant One \n\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company acquired Merchant One, Inc. (&#8220;Merchant One&#8221;), an independent sales organization focused on acquiring merchants in the restaurant, retail and e-commerce industries using an innovative mix of direct and digital marketing strategies, for approximately $ 302 million, net of $ 1 million of acquired cash. Merchant One is included within the Acceptance segment, and enhances the Company&#8217;s merchant distribution and sales force channels. The preliminary allocation of purchase price resulted in the recognition of identifiable intangible assets consisting of approximately $ 178 million of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of 10 years, $ 118 million of goodwill and $ 6 million of other net assets. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and is subject to further adjustment, pending additional refinement and final completion of valuations. Goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributed to the anticipated value created by expanding the reach of the Clover &#174; cloud-based POS and business management platform, and select value-added services that enable the Company to deliver new and innovative capabilities to Merchant One&#8217;s clients. \n\nAcquisition of Finxact \n\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company acquired a remaining ownership interest in Finxact, Inc. (&#8220;Finxact&#8221;), a developer of cloud-native banking solutions powering digital transformation throughout the financial services sector, for $ 645 million, net of $ 27 million of acquired cash. The Company previously held a noncontrolling equity interest in Finxact, which was accounted for under the equity method. The remeasurement of the Company&#8217;s previously held equity interest to its acquisition-date fair value resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $ 110 million, included within income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2022. Finxact is included within the Fintech segment and advances the Company&#8217;s digital banking strategy, expanding its account processing, digital, and payments solutions. \n\nThe allocation of purchase price recorded for Finxact was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2022 as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Cash $ 27 &#160; Other net assets 1 &#160; Intangible assets 105 &#160; Goodwill 670 &#160; Total consideration $ 803 &#160; Less: Fair value of previously held equity interest ( 131 ) Total purchase price $ 672 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributed to the anticipated value created by the combined scale, core platform modernization, and accelerated delivery of enhanced digital banking solutions offered to financial institutions of all sizes. The amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Gross Carrying Amount Weighted-Average Useful Life Acquired software and technology $ 90 &#160; 6 years Trade name 9 &#160; 5 years Customer relationships 6 &#160; 8 years Total $ 105 &#160; 6 years ##TABLE_END \n\nAcquisition of BentoBox \n\nOn November 22, 2021, the Company acquired BentoBox CMS, Inc (&#8220;BentoBox&#8221;), a digital marketing and commerce platform that helps restaurants connect with their guests, for $ 317 million, net of $ 24 million of acquired cash. BentoBox is included within the Acceptance segment and expands the Company&#8217;s Clover &#174; dining solutions and commerce and business management capabilities. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified and recorded measurement period adjustments to the preliminary BentoBox purchase price allocation, including refinements to valuations of acquired intangible assets, which were the result of additional analysis performed and information identified based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. These measurement period adjustments resulted in an increase to goodwill of $ 62 million, with offsetting amounts to the change in goodwill attributable to a decrease in identifiable intangible assets, including acquired software and technology, of $ 84 million and deferred tax adjustments of $ 22 million. Such measurement period adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income. The allocation of purchase price was finalized in the second quarter of 2022 and resulted in the recognition of identifiable intangible assets of $ 52 million, goodwill of $ 266 million and other net assets of $ 23 million. Goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributed to the anticipated value created by the enhanced strength of the Company&#8217;s omnichannel platform to drive increased operational efficiencies for restaurants, enabling operators to deliver seamless and distinct hospitality experiences for their diners. \n\nThe amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Gross Carrying Amount Weighted-Average Useful Life Acquired software and technology $ 25 &#160; 6 years Customer relationships and other 27 &#160; 4 years Total $ 52 &#160; 5 years ##TABLE_END \n\nAcquisition of Pineapple Payments \n\nOn May 4, 2021, the Company acquired Pineapple Payments Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Pineapple Payments&#8221;), an independent sales organization that provides payment processing, proprietary technology, and payment acceptance solutions for merchants, for $ 207 million, net of $ 6 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $ 30 million (see Note 9). Pineapple Payments is included within the Acceptance segment and expands the reach of the Company&#8217;s payment solutions through its technology- and relationship-led distribution channels. \n\nThe allocation of purchase price was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2021 and resulted in the recognition of identifiable intangible assets of $ 127 million, goodwill of $ 79 million and other net assets of $ 7 million. Goodwill, of which $ 59 million is deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributed to the anticipated value created by the accelerated delivery of new and innovative capabilities to merchant clients. \n\nThe amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Gross Carrying Amount Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer relationships $ 90 &#160; 17 years Residual buyouts 20 &#160; 8 years Acquired software and technology 6 &#160; 7 years Non-compete agreements and other 11 &#160; 5 years Total $ 127 &#160; 14 years ##TABLE_END \n\nAcquisition of Ondot \n\nOn January 22, 2021, the Company acquired a remaining ownership interest in Ondot Systems, Inc. (&#8220;Ondot&#8221;), a digital experience platform provider for financial institutions, for $ 271 million, net of $ 13 million of acquired cash and cash equivalents. The Company previously held a noncontrolling equity interest in Ondot, which was accounted for at cost. The remeasurement of the Company&#8217;s previously held equity interest to its acquisition-date fair value resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $ 12 million, included within other (expense) income in the consolidated statements of income during the year ended December 31, 2021. Ondot is included within the Payments segment and expands the Company&#8217;s digital capabilities, enhancing its suite of integrated payments, banking and merchant solutions. \n\nThe allocation of purchase price recorded for Ondot was finalized in the third quarter of 2021 as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 13 &#160; Receivables and other assets 9 &#160; Intangible assets 142 &#160; Goodwill 173 &#160; Payables and other liabilities ( 31 ) Total consideration $ 306 &#160; Less: Fair value of previously held equity interest ( 22 ) Total purchase price $ 284 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributed to the anticipated value created by the combined scale of integrated digital solutions to consumers, merchants, acquirers, networks and card issuers. The amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Gross Carrying Amount Weighted-Average Useful Life Acquired software and technology $ 90 &#160; 6 years Customer relationships 35 &#160; 6 years Non-compete agreements and other 17 &#160; 4 years Total $ 142 &#160; 6 years ##TABLE_END \n\nOther Acquisitions \n\nOn December 29, 2022, the Company acquired OrangeData S.A. (&#8220;Yacar&#233;&#8221;), an Argentina-based payment service provider that enables customers to transact at merchant locations using QR codes. Yacar&#233; is included within the Acceptance segment and enhances the Company&#8217;s instant payment transaction capabilities. On September 1, 2022, the Company acquired NexTable, Inc. (&#8220;NexTable&#8221;), a provider of cloud-based reservation and table management solutions for restaurants. NexTable is included within the Acceptance segment and expands the Company&#8217;s end-to-end restaurant solutions. On June 1, 2022, the Company acquired The LR2 Group, LLC (&#8220;City POS&#8221;), an independent sales organization that promotes payment processing services and facilitates the sale of POS equipment for merchants. City POS is included within the Acceptance segment and expands the Company&#8217;s merchant services business. The Company acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $ 44 million, including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $ 6 million (see Note 9). The allocation of purchase price for these acquisitions resulted in the recognition of identifiable intangible assets of $ 23 million, goodwill of $ 22 million and other net assumed liabilities of $ 1 million. The purchase price allocations for the CityPOS and NexTable acquisitions were finalized in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. The allocation of the purchase price for Yacar&#233; is preliminary and is subject to further adjustment. Goodwill for these acquisitions, of which $ 17 million is deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributed to the value created by expanding the reach of the Company&#8217;s payment solutions and enhancing omnichannel capabilities. \n\nThe amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets for other acquisitions acquired in 2022 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Gross Carrying Amount Weighted-Average Useful Life Acquired software and technology $ 12 &#160; 7 years Customer relationships 11 &#160; 10 years Total $ 23 &#160; 9 years ##TABLE_END \n\nOn November 15, 2021, the Company acquired a remaining ownership interest in NetPay Solutions Group (&#8220;NetPay&#8221;), a multi-channel payment service provider offering a range of onboarding, customer lifecycle, risk management and settlement capabilities to businesses of all sizes. The Company previously held a noncontrolling equity interest in NetPay, which was accounted for under the equity method and approximated acquisition-date fair value. NetPay is included within the Acceptance segment and expands the Company&#8217;s merchant services business. On October 1, 2021, the Company acquired Integrity Payments, LLC (&#8220;AIP&#8221;), an independent sales organization that promotes payment processing services for merchants, which is included within the Acceptance segment. On June 14, 2021, the Company acquired Spend Labs Inc. (&#8220;SpendLabs&#8221;), a mobile-native, cloud-based software provider of commercial card payment solutions. SpendLabs is included within the Payments segment and expands the Company&#8217;s digital capabilities across mobile and desktop devices for small and mid-sized businesses. On March 1, 2021, the Company acquired Radius8, Inc. (&#8220;Radius8&#8221;), a provider of a platform that uses consumer location and other information to drive incremental merchant transactions. Radius8 is included within the Acceptance segment and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to help merchants increase sales, expand mobile application registration and improve one-to-one target marketing. The Company acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $ 87 million, net of the fair value of the Company&#8217;s previously held noncontrolling equity interest in NetPay of $ 14 million and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $ 4 million (see Note 9). The allocation of purchase price for these acquisitions resulted in the recognition of identifiable intangible assets of $ 47 million, goodwill of $ 61 million and net assumed liabilities of $ 7 million. The purchase price allocation for the Radius8 acquisition was finalized in the third quarter of 2021 and for SpendLabs in the fourth quarter of 2021. The purchase price allocations for the NetPay and AIP acquisitions were finalized in the first quarter of 2022. Measurement period adjustments did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. Goodwill for these acquisitions, of which $ 14 million is deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributed to synergies, the anticipated value created by advancing digital capabilities to the Company&#8217;s clients, and selling the Company&#8217;s products and services to the acquired businesses&#8217; existing client base. \n\nThe amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets for other acquisitions acquired in 2021 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Gross Carrying Amount Weighted-Average Useful Life Acquired software and technology $ 31 &#160; 6 years Customer relationships 9 &#160; 10 years Residual buyouts 7 &#160; 5 years Total $ 47 &#160; 7 years ##TABLE_END \n\nOn March 2, 2020, the Company acquired MerchantPro Express LLC (&#8220;MerchantPro&#8221;), an independent sales organization that provides processing services, POS equipment and merchant cash advances to businesses across the U.S. MerchantPro is included within the Acceptance segment and expands the Company&#8217;s merchant services business. On March 18, 2020, the Company acquired Bypass Mobile, LLC (&#8220;Bypass&#8221;), an independent software vendor and innovator in enterprise POS systems for sports and entertainment venues, food service management providers and national restaurant chains. Bypass is included within the Acceptance segment and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to help businesses deliver seamless physical and digital customer experiences. On May 11, 2020, the Company acquired Inlet, LLC (&#8220;Inlet&#8221;), a provider of secure digital delivery solutions for enterprise and middle-market biller invoices and statements. Inlet is included within the Payments segment and enhances the Company&#8217;s digital bill payment strategy. The Company acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $ 167 million, net of $ 2 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $ 45 million. The allocation of purchase price for these acquisitions resulted in the recognition of identifiable intangible assets of $ 81 million, goodwill of $ 90 million and net assumed liabilities of $ 4 million. The purchase price allocation for the MerchantPro acquisition was finalized in the third quarter of 2020, and for the Bypass and Inlet acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2020. Goodwill for these acquisitions, of which $ 36 million is deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributed to synergies and the anticipated value created by selling the Company&#8217;s products and services to existing clients of the acquired businesses. \n\nThe amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets for other acquisitions acquired in 2020 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Gross Carrying Amount Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer relationships $ 32 &#160; 14 years Residual buyouts 35 &#160; 9 years Acquired software and technology 14 &#160; 8 years Total $ 81 &#160; 11 years ##TABLE_END \n\nDispositions \n\nDisposition of Korea Operations \n\nOn September 30, 2022, the Company sold its Korea operations, which were reported within the Acceptance segment, for total consideration of $ 50 million, consisting of $ 43 million in net cash and an equity interest in the buyer of $ 7 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $ 127 million on the sale, recorded within net gain on sale of businesses and other assets in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The loss was comprised of the difference between the consideration received and the net carrying amount of the business, including $ 40 million of allocated goodwill, $ 48 million of customer relationship net intangible assets and $ 56 million of accumulated foreign currency translation losses, which were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\nDisposition of Fiserv Costa Rica and Systems Integration Services \n\nOn October 17, 2022, the Company sold Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and its Systems Integration Services (&#8220;SIS&#8221;) operations, which provides information technology engineering services in the U.S. and India, to a single buyer, for an aggregate sales price of $ 49 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 44 million on the sales, recorded within net gain on sale of businesses and other assets, with a related tax expense of $ 8 million recorded within the income tax provision, in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Fiserv Costa Rica, S.A. and SIS were reported primarily within the Fintech segment. \n\nDissolution of Banc of America Merchant Services Joint Venture \n\nEffective July 1, 2020, the Company and Bank of America (&#8220;BANA&#8221;) dissolved the Banc of America Merchant Services joint venture (&#8220;BAMS&#8221; or the &#8220;joint venture&#8221;), of which the Company maintained a 51 % controlling ownership interest. Upon dissolution of the joint venture&#8217;s operations, the joint venture transferred a proportionate share of value, primarily the client contracts, to each party via an agreed upon contractual separation. The remaining activities of the joint venture consisted primarily of an orderly wind down of remaining BAMS assets and liabilities. Pursuant to the separation agreement, the joint venture retains the responsibility for certain contingencies that may arise from pre-dissolution activities, including certain legal claims and contingencies. The Company may be obligated to fund a proportionate share of any such losses as incurred. \n\nThe transfer of value to BANA was accounted for at fair value as a non pro rata distribution of nonmonetary assets, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $ 36 million, with a related tax expense of $ 13 million. The pre-tax gain included the revaluation of client contracts allocated to BANA to a fair value of $ 700 million, as well as an estimated $ 24 million for certain additional consideration due from the Company to BANA in connection with the dissolution. The pre-tax net gain was recorded within net gain on sale of businesses and other assets and the tax expense was recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. Noncontrolling interests of the Company were reduced by $ 726 million and the Company&#8217;s additional paid-in capital was reduced by $ 36 million to account for the wind down of the joint venture and the transfer of a proportionate share of the joint venture&#8217;s fair value to BANA. The transfer of value to the Company was accounted for at carryover basis as the Company maintains control of such assets. The business transferred to the Company continues to be operated and managed within the Company&#8217;s Acceptance segment. \n\nThe fair value of the client contracts upon dissolution of the joint venture was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. The determination of the fair values required estimates about discount rates, growth and attrition rates, future expected cash flows and other future events that were judgmental in nature. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that were not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement of the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements . The significant assumptions used included the estimated annual net cash flows (including appropriate revenue and profit attributable to the asset, retention rate, applicable tax rate, and contributory asset charges, among other factors), the discount rate, reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flow stream, an assessment of the asset&#8217;s life cycle, and the tax amortization benefit, among other factors. \n\nDisposition of Investment Services Business \n\nOn February 18, 2020, the Company sold a 60 % controlling interest of its Investment Services business, subsequently renamed Tegra118, LLC (&#8220;Tegra118&#8221;). The Company received proceeds of $ 578 million, net of related expenses, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $ 428 million, with the related tax expense of $ 112 million recorded through the income tax provision, in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The pre-tax gain included $ 176 million related to the remeasurement of the Company&#8217;s 40 % retained interest based upon the enterprise value of the business. The revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Investment Services business were consolidated into the Company&#8217;s financial results through the date of the sale transaction, and are reported within Corporate and Other (see Note 20). In conjunction with the sale transaction, the Company also entered into transition services agreements to provide, at fair value, various administration, business process outsourcing, technical and data center related services for defined periods to Tegra118. \n\nOn February 2, 2021, Tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of the Company&#8217;s ownership interest in the combined new entity, Wealthtech Holdings, LLC, which was subsequently renamed as InvestCloud Holdings, LLC (&#8220;InvestCloud&#8221;). In connection with the transaction, the Company made an additional capital contribution of $ 200 million into the combined entity and recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 28 million within income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statement of income, with related tax expense of $ 6 million recorded through the income tax provision, during the year ended December 31, 2021. On June 30, 2021, the Company sold its entire ownership interest in InvestCloud for $ 466 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $ 33 million, recorded within income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statement of income, with related tax expense of $ 8 million recorded through the income tax provision, during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company continues to provide various technical and data center related services under the terms of a service agreement with InvestCloud. \n\n5. Settlement Assets and Obligations \n\nSettlement assets and obligations represent intermediary balances arising from the settlement process which involves the transferring of funds between card issuers, payment networks, merchants and consumers, and collateral amounts held to manage merchant credit risk. The Company records settlement assets and obligations upon processing a payment transaction. Settlement assets represent amounts receivable from agents, payment networks, bank partners, merchants or direct consumers for submitted merchant transactions, and funds received by the Company in advance of paying to merchants or payees. Settlement obligations represent the unpaid amounts that are due to merchants and payees for their payment transactions and collateral deposits. \n\nThe principal components of the Company&#8217;s settlement assets and obligations were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Settlement assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,283 &#160; $ 2,361 &#160; Receivables 19,199 &#160; 11,291 &#160; Total settlement assets $ 21,482 &#160; $ 13,652 &#160; Settlement obligations Payment instruments outstanding $ 650 &#160; $ 460 &#160; Card settlements and collateral deposits due to merchants 20,832 &#160; 13,192 &#160; Total settlement obligations $ 21,482 &#160; $ 13,652 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n6.

Goodwill \n\nThe following table presents changes in goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segments (In millions) Acceptance Fintech Payments Total Goodwill - December 31, 2020 $ 21,408 &#160; $ 2,108 &#160; $ 12,806 &#160; $ 36,322 &#160; Acquisitions and valuation adjustments 321 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 197 &#160; 518 &#160; \n\nTransfers (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 67 ) 67 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency translation ( 347 ) ( 2 ) ( 58 ) ( 407 ) Goodwill - December 31, 2021 21,382 &#160; 2,039 &#160; 13,012 &#160; 36,433 &#160; Acquisitions and valuation adjustments 202 &#160; 670 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 872 &#160; Dispositions ( 40 ) ( 5 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 45 ) Foreign currency translation ( 344 ) ( 2 ) ( 103 ) ( 449 ) Goodwill - December 31, 2022 $ 21,200 &#160; $ 2,702 &#160; $ 12,909 &#160; $ 36,811 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Relates to the migration of a line of business from the Fintech segment to the Payments segment. This migration did not have a material impact on the results of operations of the affected reportable segments. \n\n8. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates \n\nThe Company maintains investments in various affiliates that are accounted for as equity method investments, the most significant of which are related to the Company&#8217;s merchant alliances. The Company&#8217;s share of net income or loss from these investments is reported within income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and the related tax expense or benefit is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. \n\nMerchant Alliances \n\nThe Company maintains ownership interests in various merchant alliances. A merchant alliance is an agreement between the Company and a financial institution that combines the processing capabilities and management expertise of the Company with the visibility and distribution channel of the financial institution. A merchant alliance acquires credit and debit card transactions from merchants. The Company provides processing and other services to the alliance and charges fees to the alliance based on contractual pricing (see Note 19). The Company&#8217;s investment in its merchant alliances was $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is reported within investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nOther Equity Method Investments \n\nThe Company maintains noncontrolling ownership interests in Sagent M&#38;C, LLC (&#8220;Sagent&#8221;) and defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC (collectively, the &#8220;Lending Joint Ventures&#8221;), which are accounted for under the equity method. In 2022, Sagent completed a transaction with a third party for the contribution from and the sale by such third party to Sagent of certain intangible and tangible personal property rights, resulting in a dilution of the Company&#8217;s ownership interest in Sagent. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 80 million within income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, with related tax expense of $ 19 million recorded through the income tax provision, in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company&#8217;s remaining noncontrolling ownership interest in Sagent continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment. The Company&#8217;s net investment in the Lending Joint Ventures was $ 72 million and $ 25 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is reported within investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company maintains other strategic investments accounted for under the equity method. The Company's aggregate investment in such entities was $ 257 million and $ 266 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is reported within investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nThe Lending Joint Ventures maintain, as amended in 2022, variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $ 437 million in senior unsecured debt at December 31, 2022 and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $ 83 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in April 2027. There were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2022. The Company has guaranteed the debt of the Lending Joint Ventures and does not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. See Note 9 for additional information. \n\nThe Company classifies distributions from its investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statements of cash flows using the cumulative earnings approach. Under this approach, distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates are classified as cash flows from operating activities to the extent that the cumulative distributions do not exceed the cumulative earnings on the investment. To the extent the current period distribution exceeds the cumulative earnings on the investment, the distribution is considered a return of investment and is classified as cash flows from investing activities. The Company received cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates of $ 211 million, $ 149 million and $ 151 million, of which $ 138 million, $ 115 million and $ 109 million were recorded as cash flows from investing activities in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nOther Equity Investments \n\nThe Company also maintains investments, of which it does not have significant influence, in various equity securities without a readily determinable fair value. Such investments totaled $ 135 million and $ 113 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company reviews these investments each reporting period to determine whether an impairment or observable price change for the investment has occurred. To the extent such events or changes occur, the Company evaluates the fair value compared to its cost basis in the investment. Gains or losses from a sale of these investments or a change in fair value are included within other (expense) income in the consolidated statements of income for the period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company remeasured its equity interest in Ondot to fair value upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $ 12 million (see Note 4). Other adjustments made to the values recorded for certain equity securities and gains and losses from sales of equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not significant. \n\n9. Fair Value Measurements \n\nThe fair values of cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, settlement assets and obligations, accounts payable, and client deposits approximate their respective carrying values due to the short period of time to maturity. The Company maintains forward exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company also maintains cross-currency rate swap contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Euro. These derivative instruments are measured on a recurring basis based on foreign currency spot rates and forwards quoted by banks and foreign currency dealers and are marked to market each period (see Note 13). Contingent consideration related to certain of the Company&#8217;s acquisitions (see Note 4) is estimated using the present value of a probability-weighted assessment approach based on the likelihood of achieving the earn-out criteria. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s contingent liability for current expected credit losses associated with its debt guarantees, as further described below, is estimated based on assumptions of future risk of default and the corresponding level of credit losses at the time of default. \n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START Fair Value (In millions) Classification Fair Value Hierarchy 2022 2021 Assets Forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other current assets Level 2 $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6 &#160; Liabilities Forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges Accounts payable and accrued expenses Level 2 $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges Other long-term liabilities Level 2 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Cross-currency rate swap contracts designated as net investment hedges Other long-term liabilities Level 2 23 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration Accounts payable and accrued expenses Level 3 6 &#160; 2 &#160; Contingent consideration Other long-term liabilities Level 3 2 &#160; 32 &#160; Contingent debt guarantee Accounts payable and accrued expenses Level 3 &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Contingent debt guarantee Other long-term liabilities Level 3 21 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company&#8217;s senior notes are recorded at amortized cost but measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The estimated fair value of senior notes was based on matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs of comparable securities (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The carrying value of the Company&#8217;s foreign lines of credit, term loan credit agreement, commercial paper notes and revolving credit facility borrowings approximates fair value as these instruments have variable interest rates and the Company has not experienced any change to its credit ratings (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The estimated fair value of total debt, excluding finance leases and other financing obligations, was $ 19.2 billion and $ 21.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the carrying value was $ 20.6 billion and $ 20.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Company maintains liabilities for its obligations to perform over the term of its debt guarantee arrangements with the Lending Joint Ventures (see Note 8), which are reported within accounts payable and accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In April 2022, the Lending Joint Ventures amended their respective term loans and revolving credit facilities, increasing aggregate borrowing capacity by $ 75 million and extending the maturity to April 2027. The Company elected to guarantee this incremental indebtedness, resulting in aggregate guarantees of $ 520 million and a pre-tax expense of $ 48 million related to such debt guarantee obligations, recorded within other (expense) income in the consolidated statement of income and within other operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company is entitled to receive a defined fee in exchange for its incremental guarantee of this indebtedness. The Company has not made any payments under the guarantees, nor has it been called upon to do so, and does not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. \n\nThe non-contingent component of the Company&#8217;s debt guarantee arrangements is recorded at amortized cost, but measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The carrying value of the Company&#8217;s non-contingent liability of $ 40 million and $ 10 million approximates the fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term of the debt. The contingent component of the Company&#8217;s debt guarantee arrangements represents the current expected credit losses to which the Company is exposed. The amount of the liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. The Company recognized $ 12 million, $ 12 million and $ 13 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, within other (expense) income in its consolidated statements of income related to its release from risk under the non-contingent guarantees as well as a change in the provision of estimated credit losses associated with the indebtedness of the Lending Joint Ventures. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s non-financial assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including property and equipment, lease ROU assets, equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, goodwill and other intangible assets, and are subject to fair value adjustment in certain circumstances. Additional information about fair value adjustments recorded on a non-recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is included in Notes 8 and 16. \n\n10. Leases \n\nCompany as Lessee \n\nThe Company primarily leases office space, data centers and equipment from third parties. The Company determines if a contract is a lease at inception. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The lease term begins on the commencement date, which is the date the Company takes possession of the asset, and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Many of the Company&#8217;s leases contain renewal options for varying periods, which can be exercised at the Company&#8217;s sole discretion. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases based on factors such as the lease term, lease payments, and the economic life, fair value and estimated residual value of the asset. Certain leases include options to purchase the leased asset at the end of the lease term, which is assessed as a part of the Company&#8217;s lease classification determination. The Company&#8217;s leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one month to 21 years. \n\nThe Company uses the right-of-use model to account for its leases. ROU assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are based on the lease liability and are increased by prepaid lease payments and decreased by lease incentives received. For leases where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal option, such option periods have been included in the determination of the Company&#8217;s ROU assets and lease liabilities. Certain leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased asset. Such amounts are not included in the measurement of the ROU assets and lease liabilities to the extent they are variable in nature. These variable lease costs are recognized as variable lease expenses when incurred. As a practical expedient, lease agreements \n\nwith lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company estimates contingent lease incentives when it is probable that the Company is entitled to the incentive at lease commencement. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. Therefore, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets; instead, lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciable life of the ROU assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain of a transfer of title or purchase option. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount future lease payments in the calculation of the lease liability and ROU asset based on the information available on the commencement date for each lease. The Company&#8217;s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate requires judgment and is determined using the Company&#8217;s current unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors such as collateralization, currency and term to align with the terms of the lease. \n\nLease Balances ##TABLE_START (In millions) December 31, 2022 2021 Assets \n\nOperating lease assets (1) \n\n$ 586 &#160; $ 575 &#160; Finance lease assets (2) \n\n541 &#160; 487 &#160; Total lease assets $ 1,127 &#160; $ 1,062 &#160; Liabilities Current: \n\nOperating lease liabilities (1) \n\n$ 124 &#160; $ 122 &#160; Finance lease liabilities (2) \n\n156 &#160; 130 &#160; Noncurrent: \n\nOperating lease liabilities (1) \n\n628 &#160; 615 &#160; Finance lease liabilities (2) \n\n366 &#160; 313 &#160; Total lease liabilities $ 1,274 &#160; $ 1,180 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Operating lease assets are included within other long-term assets , and operating lease liabilities are included within accounts payable and accrued expenses (current portion) and other long-term liabilities (noncurrent portion) in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\n(2) Finance lease assets are included within property and equipment, net and finance lease liabilities are included within short-term and current maturities of long-term debt (current portion) and long-term debt (noncurrent portion) in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nComponents of Lease Cost ##TABLE_START (In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease cost (1) \n\n$ 186 &#160; $ 162 &#160; $ 198 &#160; Finance lease cost: (2) \n\nAmortization of right-of-use assets \n\n169 &#160; 122 &#160; 150 &#160; Interest on lease liabilities \n\n17 &#160; 23 &#160; 21 &#160; Total lease cost \n\n$ 372 &#160; $ 307 &#160; $ 369 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Operating lease expense is included within cost of processing and services, cost of product and selling, general and administrative expense, dependent upon the nature and use of the ROU asset, in the consolidated statements of income.

Finance leases that have been signed but not yet commenced are for equipment and will commence in 2023 with lease terms of up to 5 years. \n\nCompany as Lessor \n\nThe Company owns certain POS terminal equipment which it leases to merchants. Leases are classified as operating or sales-type leases based on factors such as the lease term, lease payments, and the economic life, fair value and estimated residual value of the asset. The terms of the leases typically range from one month to five years . For operating leases, the minimum lease payments received are recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and the leased asset is included in property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets and depreciated over its estimated useful life. For sales-type leases, selling profit is recognized at the commencement date of the lease to the extent the fair value of the underlying asset is different from its carrying amount. Selling profit is directly impacted by the Company&#8217;s estimate of the amount to be derived from the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease term. The residual value of the asset is computed using various assumptions, including the expected value of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. Unearned income is recognized as interest income over the lease term. For sales-type leases, the Company derecognizes the carrying amount of the underlying leased asset and recognizes a net investment in the leased asset in the consolidated balance sheets. The net investment in a leased asset is computed based on the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet received and the present value of the residual value of the asset. \n\nComponents of Lease Income ##TABLE_START (In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Sales-type leases: \n\nSelling profit (1) \n\n$ 55 &#160; $ 61 &#160; $ 48 &#160; Interest income (1) \n\n99 &#160; 85 &#160; 76 &#160; Operating lease income (2) \n\n279 &#160; 297 &#160; 257 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Selling profit includes $ 147 million, $ 141 million and $ 106 million recorded within product revenue with a corresponding charge of $ 92 million, $ 80 million and $ 58 million recorded within cost of product in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest income is included within product revenue in the consolidated statements of income. \n\n(2) Operating lease income includes a nominal amount of variable lease income and is included within product revenue in the consolidated statements of income for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nComponents of Net Investment in Sales-Type Leases ##TABLE_START (In millions) December 31, 2022 2021 Minimum lease payments \n\n$ 428 &#160; $ 395 &#160; Residual values \n\n20 &#160; 23 &#160; Less: Unearned interest income \n\n( 169 ) ( 157 ) Net investment in leases (1) \n\n$ 279 &#160; $ 261 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Net investments in leased assets are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other long-term assets (noncurrent portion) in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nMaturities of Future Minimum Lease Payment Receivables \n\nFuture minimum lease payments receivable on sales-type leases were as follows at December 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Year Ending December 31, Sales-Type Leases \n\n2023 $ 169 &#160; 2024 133 &#160; 2025 88 &#160; 2026 35 &#160; 2027 3 &#160; Thereafter &#8212; &#160; Total minimum lease payments $ 428 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nLease Payment Receivables Portfolio \n\nThe Company accounts for lease payment receivables in connection with POS terminal equipment as a single portfolio. The Company recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses on lease payment receivables at the commencement date of the lease by considering the term, geography and internal credit risk ratings of such lease. The internal credit risk ratings are established based on lessee specific risk factors, such as FICO score, number of years the lessee has been in business and the nature of the lessee&#8217;s industry, which are considered indicators of the likelihood a lessee may default in the future. The allowance for estimated credit losses on lease payment receivables was $ 60 million and $ 56 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Company determines delinquency status on lease payment receivables based on the number of calendar days past due. The Company considers lease payments that are 90 days or less past due as performing. Lease payments that are greater than 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual status in which interest income is no longer recognized. Lease payment receivables are fully written off in the period they become delinquent greater than 180 days past due. The amortized cost balance of net investment in leases at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 279 million and $ 261 million, respectively. Lease payment receivables that were determined to be on non-accrual status were nominal at each of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n11.

The indentures governing the Company&#8217;s senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) the Company&#8217;s ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to, another person, (ii) the Company&#8217;s and certain of its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) the Company&#8217;s and certain of its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. The Company may, at its option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or, from time to time, in part, at any time prior to the applicable maturity date. Interest on the Company&#8217;s U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on its Euro- and British Pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. The interest rate applicable to certain of the senior notes is subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that the credit rating assigned to such notes is downgraded below investment grade. \n\nIn July 2022, the Company redeemed $ 700 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 3.500 % senior notes due in October 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company financed the redemption of these notes using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper. At December 31, 2021, the 3.500 % senior notes due in October 2022 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as the Company had the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so. At December 31, 2022, the 0.375 % Euro-denominated senior notes due in July 2023 and 3.800 % senior notes due in October 2023 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as the Company has the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under its revolving credit facility. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2021 issuance of commercial paper notes, as described below, to repay the outstanding principal balance of $ 400 million under its 4.750 % senior notes that matured in June 2021. \n\nCommercial Paper \n\nThe Company maintains unsecured U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs. From time to time, the Company may issue under these programs U.S. dollar commercial paper with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance and Euro commercial paper with maturities of up to 183 days from the date of issuance. Outstanding borrowings under the U.S. dollar program were $ 2.3 billion and $ 916 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.818 % and 0.295 %, respectively. Outstanding borrowings under the Euro program were $ 1.2 billion and $ 905 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.918 % and ( 0.420 )%, respectively. The Company intends to maintain available capacity under its revolving credit facility, as described below, in an amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding borrowings under its commercial paper programs. Outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper programs are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as long-term as the Company has the intent to refinance this commercial paper on a long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper upon maturity, and the Company also has the ability to refinance such commercial paper under its revolving credit facility. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company used the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility; to redeem its 3.500 % senior notes due in October 2022; to repay its 4.750 % senior notes that matured in June 2021; to pay down outstanding borrowings on its term loan facility; to repay amounts outstanding on its receivable securitized loan; and to fund acquisitions. \n\nRevolving Credit Facility \n\nIn June 2022, the Company entered into a new senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility with substantially the same syndicate of banks that were lenders under its prior amended and restated revolving credit facility, which the Company voluntarily terminated and replaced. The new credit agreement matures in June 2027 and provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount of availability of $ 6.0 billion. Borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;), or a base rate in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, in each case, plus a specified margin based on the Company&#8217;s long-term debt rating in effect from time to time ( 5.44 % at December 31, 2022). The credit facility also requires the Company to pay a facility fee based on the aggregate commitments in effect under the agreement from time to time. The new credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require the Company to, among other things, limit its consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.75 times the Company&#8217;s consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions. The Company was in compliance with all financial debt covenants during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nForeign Lines of Credit and Other Arrangements \n\nThe Company maintains certain short-term lines of credit with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund settlement activity associated with international operations in Latin America. The Company had amounts outstanding on these lines of credit totaling $ 198 million and $ 240 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 30.58 % and 21.01 % at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nReceivable Securitized Loan \n\nThe Company maintains a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary, First Data Receivables, LLC (&#8220;FDR&#8221;). FDR was a party to certain receivables financing arrangements, including an agreement (&#8220;Receivables Financing Agreement&#8221;) through July 2022, with certain financial institutions and other persons from time to time party thereto as lenders and group agents, pursuant to which certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company had agreed to transfer and contribute receivables to FDR, and FDR in turn could obtain borrowings from the financial institutions and other lender parties to the Receivables Financing Agreement secured by liens on those receivables. FDR&#8217;s assets were not available to satisfy the obligations of any other entities or affiliates of the Company, and FDR&#8217;s creditors were entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of FDR&#8217;s assets prior to any assets or value in FDR becoming available to the Company. In July 2022, the Company repaid $ 485 million, representing all amounts outstanding on its receivable securitized loan. The Company used proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper to repay and terminate the Receivables Financing Agreement. \n\nFDR held $ 1.0 billion in receivables as part of the securitization program at December 31, 2021, which were recorded within trade accounts receivable, net in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. FDR utilized the receivables as collateral in borrowings of $ 500 million as of December 31, 2021, at an average interest rate of 0.95 %. Outstanding borrowings bore interest at a variable rate based on one-month LIBOR plus a specified margin. At December 31, 2021, outstanding borrowings under the receivable securitized loan facility were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as the Company had the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so. \n\nTerm Loan Facility \n\nThe Company maintains a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, of which the aggregate principal amount outstanding under such agreement was $ 200 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at a variable rate based on one-month LIBOR or on a base rate, plus, in each case, a specified margin based on the Company&#8217;s long-term debt rating in effect from time to time, and mature in July 2024. The variable interest rate on the term loan facility borrowings was 5.64 % and 1.35 % at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The term loan credit facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default, that are substantially the same as those set forth in the Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility, as described above. \n\nDeferred Financing Costs \n\nDeferred financing costs are amortized as a component of interest expense, net over the term of the underlying debt using the effective interest method. Deferred financing costs primarily related to the Company&#8217;s senior notes totaled $ 76 million and $ 92 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported as a direct reduction of the related debt instrument in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred financing costs related to the Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility are reported in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 10 million and $ 3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n12. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests \n\nThe minority partner in one of the Company&#8217;s existing merchant alliance joint ventures maintains a redeemable noncontrolling interest which is presented outside of equity and carried at its estimated redemption value. The minority partner owns 1 % of the equity in the joint venture; in addition, the minority partner is entitled to a contractually determined share of the entity&#8217;s income. The agreement contains redemption features whereby the interest held by the minority partner is redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the Company&#8217;s control. The joint venture may be terminated by either party for convenience any time after December 31, 2024. In the event of termination for cause, as a result of a change in control, or for convenience after the predetermined date, the Company may be required to purchase the minority partner membership interest at a price equal to the fair market value of the minority interest through a distribution in the form of cash, certain merchant contracts of the joint venture, or a combination thereof to the minority partner. In conjunction with the termination of the joint venture, the minority partner may also exercise an option to purchase certain additional merchant contracts at fair market value. \n\nIn 2021, the Company and a joint venture minority partner mutually agreed to terminate one of the Company&#8217;s merchant alliance joint ventures effective March 2022. The redeemable noncontrolling interest was adjusted to reflect the estimated redemption value, with such adjustment recorded within additional paid-in capital in the consolidated statement of equity for the year ended December 31, 2021. In conjunction with the termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain additional merchant contracts of the joint venture. The Company received proceeds of $ 175 million from the sale of such merchant contracts of the joint venture, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $ 137 million within net gain on sale of businesses and other assets, with related tax expense of $ 7 million recorded through the income tax provision, in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of the redeemable noncontrolling interests activity during the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ 278 &#160; $ 259 &#160; Distributions paid to redeemable noncontrolling interests ( 34 ) ( 43 ) Share of income 28 &#160; 44 &#160; Adjustment to estimated redemption value &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; Derecognition of redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 111 ) &#8212; &#160; Balance at end of year $ 161 &#160; $ 278 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n13.

The notional amount of these derivatives was $ 346 million and $ 341 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2022, \n\nthe Company estimates that it will recognize losses of approximately $ 7 million in cost of processing and services during the next twelve months as foreign exchange forward contracts settle. \n\nThe Company previously entered into treasury lock agreements (&#8220;Treasury Locks&#8221;), designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate debt in connection with the acquisition and refinancing of certain indebtedness of First Data Corporation (&#8220;First Data&#8221;) and its subsidiaries. In 2019, concurrent with the issuance of U.S dollar-denominated senior notes, the Treasury Locks were settled resulting in a loss, net of income taxes, and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized to earnings over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments. The unamortized balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Treasury Locks was $ 130 million and $ 145 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2022, the Company estimates that it will recognize approximately $ 15 million in net interest expense during the next twelve months related to settled interest rate hedge contracts. \n\nNet Investment Hedges \n\nTo reduce exposure to changes in the value of the Company&#8217;s net investments in certain of its foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses its fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swap contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt as economic hedges of its net investments in such foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, aggregate notional cross-currency rate swaps of 400 million Euro were designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of the Company&#8217;s net investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. The Company has designated its Euro- and British Pound-denominated senior notes and Euro commercial paper notes as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Euro and the British Pound. \n\nThe following table outlines the terms of the Company&#8217;s cross-currency rate swap contracts at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Effective Date of Contract Maturity Date of Contract Notional Amount (EUR) Fixed Rate Paid (EUR) Fixed Rate Received (USD) September 1, 2022 June 1, 2025 80 &#160; million 2.096 &#160; % 3.85 &#160; % September 15, 2022 July 1, 2026 80 &#160; million 1.635 &#160; % 3.20 &#160; % October 6, 2022 June 1, 2025 80 &#160; million 1.922 &#160; % 3.85 &#160; % October 27, 2022 July 1, 2026 80 &#160; million 1.458 &#160; % 3.20 &#160; % November 10, 2022 June 1, 2025 80 &#160; million 1.816 &#160; % 3.85 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nForeign currency transaction gains or losses on the qualifying net investment hedge instruments are recorded as foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiaries. \n\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses) related to net investment hedges that were recorded in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cross-currency rate swap contracts \n\n$ ( 17 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency-denominated debt \n\n236 &#160; 110 &#160; ( 151 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company recorded income tax impacts of $( 73 ) million and $ 36 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss) from the translation of foreign currency-denominated senior notes, commercial paper notes and cross-currency rate swap contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a prior period adjustment which resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $ 71 million to reclassify prior year deferred tax benefits on such foreign currency translation losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss that were not previously recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Management believes this prior period adjustment was not material to the consolidated financial statements. \n\n14. Employee Benefit Plans \n\nDefined Contribution Plans \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries maintain defined contribution savings plans covering the majority of their employees. Under the plans, eligible participants may elect to contribute a specified percentage of their salaries and the Company makes matching contributions, each subject to certain limitations. The plans provide tax-deferred amounts for each participant, consisting of employee elective contributions, company matching and discretionary company contributions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily suspended company matching contributions during most of 2020 and re-established such contributions effective January 1, 2021, to equal 100 % on the first 1 % contributed and 25 % on the next 4 % contributed for eligible participants. Effective January 1, 2022, Company matching contributions were increased to 100 % on the first 1 % contributed and 50 % on the next 4 % contributed for eligible participants. Expenses for company contributions under these plans totaled $ 79 million, $ 58 million, and $ 38 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nDefined Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (collectively, the &#8220;Plans&#8221;) covering certain of its employees in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), the U.S., Germany and Austria. All of these plans are frozen and provide benefits to eligible employees based on an employee&#8217;s average final compensation and years of service. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and the funded status of the Plans as of and for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START U.K. Plan U.S. and Other Plans \n\n( In millions ) \n\n2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in projected benefit obligations: Balance at beginning of year $ ( 736 ) $ ( 777 ) $ ( 221 ) $ ( 238 ) Interest cost ( 12 ) ( 11 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Settlements &#8212; &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Actuarial gain 230 &#160; 15 &#160; 41 &#160; 9 &#160; Benefits paid 28 &#160; 21 14 &#160; 12 &#160; Foreign currency translation 72 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; 1 &#160; Balance at end of year $ ( 418 ) $ ( 736 ) $ ( 169 ) $ ( 221 ) Change in fair value of plan assets: Balance at beginning of year $ 983 &#160; $ 974 &#160; $ 183 &#160; $ 181 &#160; Actual return on plan assets \n\n( 290 ) 47 &#160; ( 39 ) 14 &#160; Settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 16 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Benefits paid ( 28 ) ( 21 ) ( 14 ) ( 12 ) Foreign currency translation ( 95 ) ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Balance at end of year $ 570 &#160; $ 983 &#160; $ 130 &#160; $ 183 &#160; Funded status of the plans $ 152 &#160; $ 247 &#160; $ ( 39 ) $ ( 38 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nThe funded status of the Plans is recognized as an asset or a liability within other long-term assets or within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nProjected Benefit Obligations \n\nThe Company records amounts relating to Plan obligations and their associated expenses based on calculations which include actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at least annually and modifies the assumptions based on current rates and trends, as appropriate. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately within the consolidated balance sheets, and are generally amortized to operating income over future periods, with the deferred amount \n\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within the consolidated balance sheets. The Company&#8217;s funding policy is to contribute quarterly an amount as recommended by the Plans&#8217; independent actuaries. Company contributions under the Plans were no minal in both 2022 and 2021, with future contributions not expected to be significant. The Company employs a building block approach in determining the expected long-term rate of return for plan assets with proper consideration of diversification and re-balancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed-income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness. \n\nThe weighted-average rate assumptions used in the measurement of the Company&#8217;s projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit expense as of and for the years ended December 31 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Projected Benefit Obligations Net Periodic Benefit Expense 2022 2021 2022 2021 Discount rate 5.01 &#160; % 1.97 &#160; % 1.97 &#160; % 1.56 &#160; % Expected long-term return on plan assets n/a n/a 2.19 &#160; % 2.25 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe estimated future benefit payments are expected to be as follows: ##TABLE_START (In millions) Year Ending December 31, 2023 $ 34 &#160; 2024 34 &#160; 2025 35 &#160; 2026 36 &#160; 2027 37 &#160; 2028-2032 196 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nPlan Assets \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investment strategy for the U.K. plan is to allocate the assets into two pools: (i) liability-hedging assets whereby the focus is risk management, protection and insurance relative to the liability target invested in, but not limited to, money market funds, debt, U.K. government bonds and U.K. government index-linked bonds; and (ii) return-seeking assets whereby the focus is on return generation and taking risk in a controlled manner. Such assets may include equities, government bonds, high-yield bonds, property, commodities or hedge funds. The Company&#8217;s target allocation for the U.K. plan based on the investment policy at December 31, 2022 was 80 % liability-hedging assets and 20 % return-seeking assets. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies. The Company&#8217;s investment strategy for the U.S. plan employs a total return investment approach whereby a diversified blend of equities and fixed-income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The Company sets an allocation mix necessary to support the underlying plan liabilities as influenced significantly by the demographics of the participants and the frozen nature of the plan. The Company&#8217;s target allocation for the U.S. plan based on the investment policy at December 31, 2022 was 61 % liability-hedging assets and 39 % return-seeking assets. \n\nThe following table sets forth assets carried and measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the Plans at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 \n\nCash and cash equivalents (1) \n\n$ 43 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Equity securities (2) \n\n1 &#160; 40 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nFixed income securities (3) \n\n137 &#160; 86 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nOther investments (4) \n\n301 &#160; ( 26 ) &#8212; &#160; Total investments at fair value $ 482 &#160; $ 100 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 \n\nCash and cash equivalents (1) \n\n$ 230 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Equity securities (2) \n\n10 &#160; 93 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nFixed income securities (3) \n\n202 &#160; 105 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nOther investments (4) \n\n361 &#160; 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total investments at fair value $ 803 &#160; $ 205 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments in money market funds. \n\n(2) Equity securities primarily consist of domestic, international and global equity pooled funds. \n\n(3) Fixed income securities primarily consist of debt securities issued by U.S. and foreign government agencies and debt obligations issued by a variety of private and public corporations. \n\n(4) Other investments primarily consist of index-linked government bonds, derivatives and other investments. \n\nIn addition to the investments presented within the fair value hierarchy table above, the Plans&#8217; assets include investments in various collective trusts that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. Such investments totaled $ 118 million and $ 158 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost \n\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost (income) were as follows for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest cost $ 17 &#160; $ 16 &#160; $ 20 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 18 ) ( 23 ) ( 24 ) Net periodic benefit income $ ( 1 ) $ ( 7 ) $ ( 4 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company commenced actions necessary to terminate the plans in the U.S. and U.K. Termination is subject to certain considerations, including regulatory review, interest rates and annuity pricing. Upon termination, the Company expects to recognize a non-cash pension settlement charge, which includes the recognition of remaining actuarial gains (losses) recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss, and derecognition of the net assets of such plans. The amount of accrued vested benefits to be received by participants will not be impacted. \n\n15. Share-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company recognizes the fair value of share-based compensation awards granted to employees in cost of processing and services, cost of product, and selling, general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of income. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s share-based compensation awards are typically granted in the first quarter of the year; however, grants may also occur throughout the year in conjunction with acquisitions of businesses, and primarily consist of the following: \n\nRestricted Stock Units and Awards &#8211; The Company grants restricted stock units and awards to employees and non-employee directors. Time-based restricted stock units and award grants generally vest over a three - or four-year period. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest over a three - to five-year period based upon the achievement of defined performance goals including revenue growth, achievement of integration milestones, and completion of strategic initiatives. The Company recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock units and awards based on the market price of its common stock on the grant date over the period during which the units and awards vest. \n\nPerformance Share Units &#8211; The Company grants performance share units to employees. The number of shares issued at the end of the performance period is determined by the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, including earnings, revenue growth, synergy and integration attainment, and shareholder return. The Company recognizes compensation expense on performance share units ratably over the requisite performance period of the award, generally two to five years , to the extent management views the performance goals as probable of attainment. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the shareholder return component over the requisite service period of the award. \n\nStock Options &#8211; The Company grants stock options to employees and non-employee directors at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company&#8217;s stock on the dates of grant. Stock option grants generally vest over a three - or four-year period. All stock options expire ten years from the date of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the stock options over the requisite service period of the stock option award. \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan &#8211; The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock each quarter through payroll deductions at a discount of the closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the last business day of each calendar quarter. Effective April 9, 2020, the Company temporarily suspended the employee discount of 10 % under the employee stock purchase plan to help manage discretionary costs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective January 1, 2021, the discount under the employee stock purchase plan was re-established at 5 %, which is considered noncompensatory and therefore does not give rise to recognizable compensation cost. \n\nThe Company recognized $ 323 million, $ 239 million and $ 369 million of share-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock units and awards, performance share units, and unvested stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, of $ 495 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, stock options to purchase 3.7 million, 4.4 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, were exercised. \n\nShare-Based Compensation Activity \n\nNo stock option awards were granted during the year ended December 31, 2022. The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 33.35 and $ 35.02 per share, respectively. The fair values of stock options granted were estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions: ##TABLE_START 2021 2020 Expected life (in years) 6.5 6.4 Average risk-free interest rate 0.6 &#160; % 1.8 &#160; % Expected volatility 29.3 &#160; % 28.3 &#160; % Expected dividend yield 0 &#160; % 0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company determined the expected life of stock options using historical data. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. Expected volatility was determined using weighted-average implied market volatility combined with historical volatility. The Company believes that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility. \n\nA summary of stock option activity is as follows: ##TABLE_START Shares (In thousands) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In millions) \n\nStock options outstanding - December 31, 2021 \n\n10,229 &#160; $ 56.36 &#160; Granted &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Forfeited ( 204 ) 111.39 &#160; Exercised ( 3,689 ) 42.06 &#160; Stock options outstanding - December 31, 2022 6,336 &#160; $ 62.91 &#160; 3.92 $ 256 &#160; Stock options exercisable - December 31, 2022 5,696 &#160; $ 57.36 &#160; 3.52 $ 256 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nA summary of restricted stock unit, restricted stock award and performance share unit activity is as follows: ##TABLE_START Restricted Stock Units and Awards Performance Share Units Shares (In thousands) Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Shares (In thousands) Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Units and awards - December 31, 2021 5,074 &#160; $ 101.09 &#160; 1,392 &#160; $ 96.32 &#160; Granted 3,473 &#160; 93.54 &#160; 3,050 &#160; 100.78 &#160; Forfeited ( 759 ) 100.21 &#160; ( 122 ) 97.00 &#160; Vested ( 2,258 ) 99.70 &#160; ( 1,077 ) 103.13 &#160; Units and awards - December 31, 2022 5,530 &#160; $ 96.88 &#160; 3,243 &#160; $ 100.93 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nIn conjunction with certain acquisitions, the Company granted restricted stock units with performance vesting provisions to be measured over two and five years , which are presented as performance share units within the table above. \n\nThe table below presents additional information related to stock option and restricted stock unit activity: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 226 &#160; $ 339 &#160; $ 194 &#160; Fair value of restricted stock units vested 335 &#160; 332 &#160; 454 &#160; Income tax benefit from stock options exercised and restricted stock units vested \n\n109 &#160; 142 &#160; 156 &#160; Cash received from stock options exercised 105 &#160; 91 &#160; 83 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAt December 31, 2022, 22.0 million share-based awards were available for grant under the Amended and Restated Fiserv, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Under its employee stock purchase plan, the Company issued 0.5 million shares during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2022, there were 23.3 million shares available for issuance under the employee stock purchase plan. \n\n16. Restructuring and Other Charges \n\nIn connection with the acquisition of First Data in 2019, the Company implemented integration plans focused on reducing the Company&#8217;s overall cost structure, including reducing vendor spend and eliminating duplicate costs. The Company recorded restructuring charges related to certain of these integration activities of $ 118 million and $ 303 million, primarily reported in cost of processing and service and selling, general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of income, based upon committed actions during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nEmployee Termination Costs \n\nThe Company recorded $ 187 million, $ 95 million and $ 131 million of employee termination costs related to cash severance and other separation costs for terminated employees during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Employee termination costs include those charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of First Data during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the reserve related to the Company&#8217;s employee severance and other separation costs during the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ 36 &#160; $ 27 &#160; Severance and other separation costs 187 &#160; 95 &#160; Cash payments ( 200 ) ( 86 ) Balance at end of year $ 23 &#160; $ 36 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe employee severance and other separation costs accrual balance of $ 23 million at December 31, 2022 is expected to be paid within the next twelve months. In addition, the Company recorded $ 22 million, $ 8 million and $ 48 million of share-based compensation costs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the accelerated vesting of equity awards for terminated employees. \n\nFacility Exit Costs \n\nThe Company permanently vacated certain leased facilities in advance of the non-cancellable lease terms as part of the Company&#8217;s efforts to reduce facility costs in connection with the First Data acquisition during 2021 and 2020, and in connection with a strategic consolidation of facilities during 2022. In conjunction with the exit of these leased facilities, the Company assessed the respective operating lease ROU assets for impairment by comparing the carrying values of the ROU assets to the discounted cash flows from estimated sublease payments (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). In addition, the Company assessed certain property and equipment associated with owned and leased facilities for impairment. As a result, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $ 14 million, $ 15 million and $ 124 million reported in selling, general and administrative expense within the consolidated statements of income during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, associated with the early exit of these facilities. The Company continues to evaluate its facility locations and therefore may incur additional exit costs in future periods. \n\nOther Costs \n\nDuring 2020, in connection with initiatives to reduce the Company&#8217;s overall cost structure following the acquisition of First Data, the Company terminated certain of its existing lease agreements to upgrade and consolidate its computing infrastructure. The Company upgraded or replaced certain leased hardware under separate, new lease agreements, resulting in the early termination and disposal of existing hardware under the current lease agreements. As such, the Company adjusted the amortization period for these existing lease agreements to coincide with the modified remaining term. Finance lease expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $ 62 million of accelerated amortization associated with the termination of these vendor contracts. In addition, the Company executed similar terminations to certain of its existing software financing agreements.

Income Taxes \n\nSubstantially all of the Company&#8217;s pre-tax earnings are derived from domestic operations in all years presented. The income tax provision was as follows for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Components of income tax provision (benefit): Current: Federal $ 802 &#160; $ 378 &#160; $ ( 25 ) State 175 &#160; 138 &#160; 71 &#160; Foreign 132 &#160; 109 &#160; 79 &#160; 1,109 &#160; 625 &#160; 125 &#160; Deferred: Federal ( 339 ) ( 186 ) 189 &#160; State ( 84 ) ( 106 ) ( 34 ) Foreign ( 135 ) 30 &#160; ( 84 ) ( 558 ) ( 262 ) 71 &#160; Income tax provision $ 551 &#160; $ 363 &#160; $ 196 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate is as follows for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % State income taxes, net of federal effect 2.5 &#160; % 1.6 &#160; % 2.0 &#160; % Foreign tax law changes &#8212; &#160; % 8.0 &#160; % 2.8 &#160; % Foreign derived intangibles income deduction ( 0.9 ) % ( 3.1 ) % ( 3.2 ) % Excess tax benefit from share-based awards ( 0.8 ) % ( 2.2 ) % ( 3.9 ) % Sale of businesses and subsidiary restructuring ( 2.2 ) % ( 2.1 ) % 0.7 &#160; % Unrecognized tax benefits ( 0.5 ) % ( 2.7 ) % ( 1.0 ) % Nondeductible executive compensation 0.4 &#160; % 0.7 &#160; % 2.0 &#160; % Valuation allowance ( 0.5 ) % ( 1.3 ) % ( 1.7 ) % Other, net ( 0.1 ) % 1.9 &#160; % ( 2.0 ) % Effective income tax rate 18.9 &#160; % 21.8 &#160; % 16.7 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nForeign tax law changes included $ 134 million and $ 32 million of income tax expense attributed to the revaluation of certain net deferred tax liabilities in connection with enacted corporate income tax rate changes in foreign countries during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, the enacted tax rate in the United Kingdom increased from 19% to 25% starting in 2023, and the tax rate in Argentina increased from 25% to 35%. In 2020, the tax rate in the United Kingdom increased from 17% to 19%. \n\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Accrued expenses $ 170 &#160; $ 171 &#160; Share-based compensation 116 &#160; 134 &#160; Net operating loss and credit carry-forwards 805 &#160; 804 &#160; Leasing liabilities 170 &#160; 194 &#160; Other 163 &#160; 194 &#160; Subtotal 1,424 &#160; 1,497 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 620 ) ( 697 ) Total deferred tax assets 804 &#160; 800 &#160; Capitalized software development costs ( 481 ) ( 633 ) Intangible assets ( 2,319 ) ( 2,676 ) Property and equipment ( 308 ) ( 280 ) Capitalized commissions ( 106 ) ( 95 ) Investments in joint ventures ( 597 ) ( 630 ) Leasing right-of-use assets ( 134 ) ( 142 ) Other ( 405 ) ( 474 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 4,350 ) ( 4,930 ) Total $ ( 3,546 ) $ ( 4,130 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company maintained a valuation allowance of $ 620 million and $ 697 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, against its deferred tax assets. Substantially all of the valuation allowance relates to certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards. \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Noncurrent assets $ 56 &#160; $ 42 &#160; Noncurrent liabilities ( 3,602 ) ( 4,172 ) Total $ ( 3,546 ) $ ( 4,130 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nNoncurrent deferred tax assets are included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nThe following table presents the amounts of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and general business credit carryforwards at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 \n\nNet operating loss carryforwards: (1) \n\nFederal $ 214 &#160; $ 178 &#160; State 2,810 &#160; 3,763 &#160; Foreign 2,373 &#160; 2,580 &#160; \n\nGeneral business credit carryforwards (2) \n\n17 &#160; 12 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) At December 31, 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 214 million, most of which do not expire, state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 2.8 billion, most of which expire in 2023 through 2042, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 2.4 billion, of which $ 276 million expire in 2023 through 2041, and the remainder of which do not expire. \n\n(2) Substantially all of the general business credit carryforwards relate to foreign tax credits. \n\nThe Company asserts that its investment in its foreign subsidiaries is intended to be indefinitely reinvested. Undistributed historical and future earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Should these earnings be distributed in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to foreign or U.S. taxes. The Company has the ability and intent to limit distributions so as to not make a distribution in excess of its investment in those \n\nsubsidiaries. The Company will continue to monitor its global cash requirements and the need to recognize a deferred tax liability. \n\nUnrecognized tax benefits were as follows at December 31: ##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Unrecognized tax benefits - Beginning of year $ 124 &#160; $ 171 &#160; $ 145 &#160; Increases for tax positions taken during the current year 3 &#160; 16 &#160; 9 &#160; Increases for tax positions taken in prior years &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 53 &#160; Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years ( 18 ) ( 41 ) ( 23 ) Decreases for settlements ( 2 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Lapse of the statute of limitations ( 11 ) ( 26 ) ( 11 ) Unrecognized tax benefits - End of year $ 96 &#160; $ 124 &#160; $ 171 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAt December 31, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits of $ 58 million, net of federal and state benefits, would affect the effective income tax rate if recognized. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $ 10 million over the next twelve months as a result of possible closure of federal tax audits, potential settlements with certain states and foreign countries, and the lapse of the statute of limitations in various state and foreign jurisdictions. \n\nThe Company classifies interest expense and penalties related to income taxes as components of its income tax provision. The income tax provision included interest expense (benefits) and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of less than $ 1 million in 2022, $( 6 ) million in 2021 and $ 3 million in 2020. Accrued interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled $ 13 million and $ 15 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2021 and 2022, and tax returns in certain states and foreign jurisdictions for 2015 through 2022, remain subject to examination by taxing authorities. \n\n18. Commitments and Contingencies \n\nLitigation \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in lawsuits in which claims are asserted against the Company. In 2021, the Company resolved a matter, for which the Company previously had accrued, with a class of merchants related to alleged violations by an independent sales organization resulting in a payment of $ 28 million. In 2020, the Company resolved a matter with the Federal Trade Commission related to a U.S.-based wholesale independent sales organization resulting in a payment of $ 40 million, for which the Company previously had accrued. The Company maintained accruals of $ 21 million and $ 32 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to its various legal proceedings, primarily associated with the Company&#8217;s merchant acquiring business and certain tax matters. The Company&#8217;s estimate of the possible range of exposure for various litigation matters in excess of amounts accrued is $ 0 million to approximately $ 60 million. In the opinion of management, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from such legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. \n\nElectronic Payments Transactions \n\nIn connection with the Company&#8217;s processing of electronic payments transactions, which are separate and distinct from the settlement payment transactions described in Note 5, funds received from subscribers are invested from the time the Company collects the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients. These subscriber funds are invested in short-term, highly liquid investments. Subscriber funds, which are not included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets, can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity and totaled approximately $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nIndemnifications and Warranties \n\nThe Company may indemnify its clients from certain costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright or trademark infringement associated with its clients&#8217; use of the Company&#8217;s products or services. The Company may also warrant to clients that its products and services will operate substantially in accordance with identified specifications. From time to time, in connection with sales of businesses, the Company agrees to indemnify the buyers of such businesses for liabilities associated with the businesses that are sold. Payments, net of recoveries, under such indemnification or warranty provisions were not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. \n\n19. Related Party Transactions \n\nMerchant Alliances \n\nA portion of the Company&#8217;s business is conducted through merchant alliances between the Company and financial institutions (see Note 8). To the extent the Company maintains a controlling financial interest in an alliance, the alliance&#8217;s financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company and the related processing fees are treated as an intercompany transaction and eliminated in consolidation. To the extent the Company has significant influence in, but not control of, an alliance, the Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in the alliance. As a result, the processing and other service fees charged to merchant alliances accounted for under the equity method are recognized in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income primarily as processing and services revenue. Such fees totaled $ 187 million, $ 171 million and $ 183 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No directors or officers of the Company have ownership interests in any of the alliances. The formation of each of these alliances generally involves the Company and the financial institution contributing contracts with merchants to the alliance and a cash payment from one owner to the other to achieve the desired ownership percentage for each. The Company and the financial institution enter into a long-term processing service agreement, which governs the Company&#8217;s provision of transaction processing services to the alliance. The Company had approximately $ 43 million and $ 36 million of amounts due from unconsolidated merchant alliances included within trade accounts receivable, net in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nEffective July 1, 2020, the Company and Bank of America dissolved their BAMS joint venture, of which the Company had a 51 % controlling ownership interest. Upon dissolution of the joint venture&#8217;s operations, the joint venture transferred a proportionate share of value, primarily the client contracts, to each party via an agreed upon contractual separation. The revenues and expenses of the BAMS joint venture were consolidated into the Company&#8217;s financial results through the date of dissolution. See Note 4 for additional information. \n\nJoint Venture Transition Services Agreements \n\nPursuant to certain transition services agreements, the Company provides, at fair value, various administration, business process outsourcing, and technical and data center related services for defined periods to certain joint ventures accounted for under the equity method. Amounts transacted through these agreements, including with InvestCloud through June 30, 2021, totaled $ 18 million, $ 37 million and $ 58 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were primarily recognized as processing and services revenue in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nOn May 3, 2021, New Omaha Holdings L.P. (&#8220;New Omaha&#8221;), a shareholder of the Company, completed an underwritten secondary public offering of 23.0 million shares of Fiserv, Inc. common stock (the &#8220;2021 offering&#8221;). The Company did not sell any shares in, nor did it receive any proceeds from, the 2021 offering. New Omaha received all of the net proceeds from the 2021 offering. In connection with the 2021 offering, the Company repurchased from the underwriters 5.0 million shares of its common stock that were subject to the 2021 offering, at a price equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters to New Omaha in the 2021 offering (the &#8220;2021 share repurchase&#8221;). The 2021 share repurchase totaled $ 588 million and was funded with cash on hand. The repurchased shares were cancelled and no longer outstanding following the completion of the 2021 share repurchase. Prior to the 2021 offering, New Omaha owned approximately 13 % of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock, and immediately following the 2021 offering, New Omaha owned approximately 9 % of such outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2022, New Omaha did no t own any of the outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. \n\nOn December 14, 2020, New Omaha completed an underwritten secondary public offering of 20.1 million shares of Fiserv, Inc. common stock (the &#8220;2020 offering&#8221;). The Company did not sell any shares in, nor did it receive any proceeds from, the 2020 offering. New Omaha received all of the net proceeds from the 2020 offering. In connection with the 2020 offering, the Company repurchased from the underwriters 1.8 million shares of its common stock that were subject to the 2020 offering, at a price equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters to New Omaha in the 2020 offering (the &#8220;2020 share repurchase&#8221;). The 2020 share repurchase totaled $ 200 million and was funded with cash on hand. The repurchased shares were cancelled and no longer outstanding following the completion of the 2020 share repurchase. Prior to the 2020 offering, New Omaha owned approximately 16 % of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock, and immediately following the 2020 offering, New Omaha owned approximately 13 % of such outstanding shares. \n\n20.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nRevenue &#8211; Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company generates revenue from the delivery of processing, service and product solutions. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer, which may be at a point in time or over time. The Company&#8217;s revenue consists of a significant volume of transactions sourced from multiple systems and applications. The processing of such transactions and recording of the majority of revenue is system-driven and based on contractual terms with customers. In addition, contract modifications occur when the Company and its customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract. Contract modifications also occur when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by the Company, which may result in the customer paying a termination fee to the Company based upon the terms in the initial contract. When a contract modification occurs, it requires the Company to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as: (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, \n\nincluding the allocation of consideration to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation. \n\nWe identified the complexity of revenue processing and revenue recognition, including customer contract modifications, as a critical audit matter because of the increased extent of effort and involvement of professionals in our firm having expertise in information technology (IT) to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems and automated controls and the management judgments necessary to determine the appropriate accounting. This required an increased extent of effort and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether revenue transactions were recognized appropriately. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to revenue recognition included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We evaluated management&#8217;s significant accounting policies. \n\n&#8226; We tested internal controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various reports extracted from the IT systems to the Company&#8217;s general ledger and those related to the Company&#8217;s accounting for contract modifications. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in IT, we: \n\n&#9702; Identified the relevant systems used to process revenue transactions and tested the general IT controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management controls, and IT operations controls. \n\n&#9702; Tested system interface controls and automated controls within the relevant revenue streams, as well as the controls designed to assess the accuracy and completeness of revenue. \n\n&#8226; We developed expectations of revenue at a disaggregated level based on historical transaction prices and current year volumes. We compared those estimates to revenue recognized by the Company. \n\n&#8226; For a sample of revenue transactions, we tested selected transactions by agreeing the amounts of revenue recognized to source documents and testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue. \n\n&#8226; We selected a sample of significant customer contract modifications and performed the following procedures: \n\n&#9702; Obtained and read the customer contracts. \n\n&#9702; Evaluated whether the contract represented a new contract or a contract modification and, if applicable, assessed the treatment of any change in scope or price. \n\n&#9702; Tested management&#8217;s identification of remaining performance obligations. \n\n&#9702; Recalculated the transaction price and assessed the appropriateness of the allocation of consideration to each performance obligation. \n\n&#9702; Assessed the pattern of delivery for each distinct performance obligation. \n\nGoodwill &#8212; Certain Reporting Units &#8212; Refer to Note 1 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company&#8217;s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using both a discounted cash flow model and a market approach. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions related to revenue growth rates, margin growth rates and discount rates. The goodwill balance was $36,811 million as of December 31, 2022. For all reporting units, the fair values exceeded the carrying values and therefore, no impairment was recognized. \n\nThe four reporting units we identified as a critical audit matter have goodwill balances of $1,602 million, $813 million, $7,280 million, and $1,194 million, respectively, and their fair values exceeded their carrying values as of the annual assessment, ranging between 7% and 18%. Revenue growth rates, margin growth rates, and discounts rates for these four reporting units are sensitive to significant and long-term deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, industry or market conditions. \n\nWe identified goodwill for these four reporting units as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to estimate the fair value of these reporting units and the sensitivity of operations to changes in the macroeconomic environment, industry or market conditions. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an \n\nincreased extent of effort, including the need to involve professionals in our firm having expertise in valuation, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, margin growth rates, and selection of the discount rates. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the revenue growth rates, margin growth rates, and the selection of discount rates for the four reporting units included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of controls over management&#8217;s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of these reporting units, specifically controls related to management&#8217;s forecasts and selection of the discount rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated management&#8217;s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to management&#8217;s historical forecasts. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the reasonableness of management&#8217;s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results, (2) industry reports containing analyses of the Company&#8217;s and its competitors&#8217; products and (3) forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in valuation, we evaluated the discount rates including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1985. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures \n\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\n(b) Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nManagement&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions. \n\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on management&#8217;s assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. \n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has issued their attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report is included below under the heading &#8220;Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.&#8221; \n\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere was no change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n(d) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and has issued their report as set forth below. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Fiserv, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fiserv, Inc. and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\n"
