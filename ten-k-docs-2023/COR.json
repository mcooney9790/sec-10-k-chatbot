      "text": " ITEM 1. BUSINESS \n\nAs used herein, the terms \"Company,\" \"AmerisourceBergen,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\" refer to AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a Delaware corporation. \n\nAmerisourceBergen is one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. More specifically, we distribute a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name, and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers located in the United States and select global markets, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, physician practices, medical and dialysis clinics, veterinarians, and other customers. Additionally, we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services, including data analytics, outcomes research, reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services, niche premium logistics services, inventory management, pharmacy automation, pharmacy management, and packaging solutions. \n\nIndustry Overview \n\nPharmaceutical sales in the United States, as recently estimated by IQVIA, an independent third-party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4.5% from 2021 through 2026, and the growth rate is dependent, in part, on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases. In addition to general economic conditions, factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the United States and other industry trends include: \n\nAging Population. The number of individuals aged 65 and over in the United States is expected to exceed 66 million by 2026 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population. This age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the United States. \n\nIntroduction of New Pharmaceuticals. Traditional research and development, as well as the advent of new research, production, and delivery methods, such as biotechnology and gene therapy, continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases. We believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry. In particular, we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business. \n\nIncreased Use of Generic and Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals. A number of patents for widely used brand-name pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years. In addition, increased emphasis by managed care and other third-party payors on utilization of generics and biosimilars has accelerated their growth. We consider the increase in generic and biosimilar usage a favorable trend because generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand-name products, although their lower prices reduce revenue growth. Generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90% of the prescription volume in the United States. \n\nIncreased Use of Drug Therapies. In response to rising healthcare costs, governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases. While national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs, we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays. Pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10% of overall healthcare costs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers' continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of cost-effective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies. \n\nLegislative Developments. In 2010, the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance, which increased the number of people in the United States who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs. The health reform law provides for sweeping changes to Medicare and Medicaid policies (including drug reimbursement policies), expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry, enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse, and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. Subsequent legislation and rules promulgated by government agencies have made additional changes to federal drug payment policies. These policies and other legislative developments (including potential revisions to or \n\nTable of Contents \n\nrepeal of any portions of the health reform legislation) may affect our businesses directly and/or indirectly (see Government Regulation a nd the risk factor titled Legal, regulatory, and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement, pricing, and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including through declining reimbursement rates for further details). \n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") declared a global pandemic attributable to the outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19. In connection with the mitigation and containment procedures recommended by the WHO and imposed by federal, state, and local governmental authorities, we implemented measures designed to keep our employees safe and address business continuity issues at our distribution centers and other locations. We continue to evaluate and plan for the potential effects of any disruption and the related impacts on our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. These items include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers and the realization of accounts receivable, changes in availability and demand for our products and services, changes in operating costs, and delays related to current and future projects. While our operational and financial performance may be significantly impacted by COVID-19, it is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the outbreak and whether it could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows (see Risk Factor - We face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, and the ongoing spread of COVID-19 has had adverse effects on our business). \n\nOther economic conditions and certain risk factors could adversely affect our business and prospects (see Item 1A. Risk Factors). \n\nThe Company \n\nWe serve our customers (healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers) through a geographically diverse network of distribution service centers and other operations in the United States and select global markets. In our pharmaceutical distribution businesses, we are typically the primary supplier of pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare provider customers. We offer a broad range of services to our customers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations, which allow them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel. \n\nStrategy \n\nOur business strategy is focused on the global pharmaceutical supply channel where we provide distribution and value-added services to healthcare providers (primarily pharmacies, health systems, medical and dialysis clinics, physicians, and veterinarians) and pharmaceutical manufacturers to improve channel efficiencies and patient outcomes. Our strategy is one of driving executional excellence in our core distributions solutions business in the U.S. and Internationally, while also investing in higher margin, high growth adjacencies where we provide solutions to pharmaceutical manufacturers to support the clinical development and commercialization of their therapies and support providers in driving efficiency and effectiveness of their operations. Implementing this disciplined and focused strategy in a seamless and unified way has allowed us to significantly expand our business. We are well positioned to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy: \n\n&#8226; Optimize and Grow U.S. Healthcare Solutions Businesses. We are well positioned in size and market breadth to continue to grow our U.S. Healthcare Solutions businesses as we invest to improve our operating and capital efficiencies. Our U.S. human health distribution businesses, including specialty pharmaceuticals, anchors our growth and position in the pharmaceutical supply channel as we provide superior distribution services and deliver value-added solutions, which improve the efficiency and competitiveness of both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers, thus allowing the pharmaceutical supply channel to better deliver healthcare to patients. \n\nWe are a leader in distribution and services to community oncologists and have leading positions in other physician-administered products. We distribute plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty products. We are well positioned to service and support biotechnology therapies, including biosimilars, expected to be coming to market in the near future. \n\nWe have introduced strategies to enhance our position in the generic marketplace, including our generic product private label program based in Ireland. We source generics globally, offer a value-added generic formulary program to our healthcare provider customers, and monitor our customers' compliance with our generics program. We also provide data and other valuable services to our manufacturer customers. \n\nWe offer value-added services and solutions to assist healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers to improve their efficiency and their patient outcomes. Services for manufacturers include: assistance with rapid new \n\nTable of Contents \n\nproduct launches, promotional and marketing services to accelerate product sales, product data reporting, market access and health economics consulting, patient support programs, and logistical support. \n\nOur provider solutions include: our Good Neighbor Pharmacy&#174; program, which enables independent community pharmacies to compete more effectively through pharmaceutical benefit and merchandising programs; Elevate Provider Network&#174;, our managed care network, which connects our retail pharmacy customers to payor plans throughout the country and is one of the largest in the United States; generic product purchasing and private label services; hospital pharmacy consulting designed to improve operational efficiencies; and packaging solutions for institutional and retail healthcare providers. We also offer services that optimize patient access and provide purchasing power to providers. \n\nWe believe we have one of the lowest operating cost structures among all pharmaceutical distributors. Our robust distribution facility network includes a national distribution center in Columbus, OH, which offers pharmaceutical manufacturers a single shipping destination. We continue to seek opportunities to achieve increased productivity and operating income gains as we invest in and continue to implement warehouse automation technology, adopt \"best practices\" in warehousing activities, and increase operating leverage by increasing volume per full-service distribution facility. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our offerings in our human health distribution businesses. \n\nOur animal health business sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. It also offers its customers a variety of value-added services, including its e-commerce platform, technology management systems, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory management system, equipment procurement consultation, special order fulfillment, and educational seminars, which we believe closely integrate the animal health business with its customers' day-to-day operations and provide them with meaningful incentives to remain customers. \n\nOur consulting service businesses help global pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers commercialize their products. We believe we are one of the largest providers of reimbursement services that assist pharmaceutical companies in supporting access to branded drugs. We also provide outcomes research, contract field staffing, patient assistance and copay assistance programs, adherence programs, risk mitigation services, and other market access programs to pharmaceutical companies. \n\n&#8226; Optimize and Grow Our International Healthcare Solutions Businesses. We are well positioned in size and market breadth to continue to grow our International Healthcare Solutions businesses as we invest to improve our operating and capital efficiencies. The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment consists of businesses that focus on international pharmaceutical wholesale and related service operations and global commercialization services. The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes pharmaceuticals, other healthcare products, and related services to healthcare providers, including pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals primarily in Europe. It also is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. The Canada business drives innovative partnerships with manufacturers, providers, and pharmacies to improve product access and efficiency throughout the healthcare supply chain. \n\n&#8226; Acquisitions. In order to grow our core strategic offerings and to enter related markets, we have acquired and invested in businesses and will continue to consider additional acquisitions and investments. \n\nIn September 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire PharmaLex Holding GmbH (&#8220;PharmaLex&#8221;), a leading provider of specialized services for the life sciences industry, for &#8364;1.28 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments. PharmaLex's services include regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance, and quality management and compliance. The acquisition will advance our role as a partner of choice for biopharmaceutical manufacturers by enhancing our global portfolio of solutions to support manufacturer partners across the pharmaceutical development and commercialization journey. PharmaLex will be a component of our International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment. The acquisition is expected to close by March 2023 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. \n\n&#8226; Divestitures. In order to allow us to concentrate on our strategic focus areas, we have divested certain non-core businesses and may, from time to time, consider additional divestitures. \n\nWe completed the sales of non-core subsidiaries in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and received total proceeds $272.6 million, subject to final working capital adjustments. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOperations \n\nOperating Structure. We are organized geographically based upon the products and services we provide to our customers. Our operations are comprised of two reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions. U.S. Healthcare Solutions consists of the legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment (excluding Profarma), MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group, and ICS 3PL. International Healthcare Solutions consists of Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, Innomar, Profarma, and Profarma Specialty (until it was divested in June 2022). Profarma had previously been included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment. \n\nU.S. Healthcare Solutions Segment \n\nThe U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. It also provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that ranges from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. Additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. Through its animal health business, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. Our animal health business also offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers. \n\nInternational Healthcare Solutions \n\nThe International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment consists of businesses that focus on international pharmaceutical wholesale and related service operations and global commercialization services. The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes pharmaceuticals, other healthcare products, and related services to healthcare providers, including pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals primarily in Europe. It also is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. In Canada, the business drives innovative partnerships with manufacturers, providers, and pharmacies to improve product access and efficiency throughout the healthcare supply chain. \n\nSales and Marketing . The majority of U.S. Healthcare Solutions' sales force is led nationally, with geographic focus and specialized by either healthcare provider type or size. Customer service representatives are centralized in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner. U.S. Healthcare Solutions also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings. U.S. Healthcare Solutions' sales teams also serve national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensure that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs. Our International Healthcare Solutions' businesses each have independent sales forces that specialize in their respective product and service offerings. In addition, we have an enterprise-wide marketing team that coordinates branding and all other marketing activities across the Company. \n\nCustomers. We have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers. Institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals, health systems, mail order pharmacies, long-term care and other alternate care pharmacies, and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities, physicians, and physician group practices. Retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains, independent community pharmacies, pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers, and veterinarians. We are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers. Our manufacturer customers include branded, generic, and biotechnology manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals, as well as over-the-counter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers. In addition, we offer a broad range of value-added solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers, thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers. \n\nOur two largest customers, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (\"WBA\") and Express Scripts, Inc. (\"Express Scripts\"), accounted for approximately 27% a nd approximately 13% , respectively, of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Our top 10 customers, including governmental agencies and group purchasing organizations (\"GPO\"), represented \n\nTable of Contents \n\napproximately 66% of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The loss of any major customer or GPO relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. If those contracts are not renewed, or are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nSuppliers. We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are strong. The 10 largest suppliers in fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 accounted for approximately 46% of our purchases. \n\nInformation Systems . The U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating segment&#8217;s distribution facilities in the United States primarily operate under a single enterprise resource planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) system. U.S. Healthcare Solutions&#8217; ERP system provides for, among other things, electronic order entry by customers, invoice preparation and purchasing, and inventory tracking. Our International Healthcare Solutions operating segment operates the majority of its businesses on their own operating systems. We continue to make investments to enhance and upgrade the operating systems utilized by our International Healthcare Solutions operating segments, including, but not limited to, Alliance Healthcare. We also continue to invest in cybersecurity capabilities as a key priority. \n\nAdditionally, we are improving our entity-wide infrastructure environment to drive efficiency, capabilities, and speed to market. \n\nWe will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology. For example, in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements (see Risk Factor - Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability) , we expect to continue to make significant investments in our secure supply chain information systems. \n\nU.S. Healthcare Solutions has made significant investments in its electronic ordering systems. U.S. Healthcare Solutions&#8217; systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by helping customers to reduce operating costs, and by providing them a platform for a number of basic and value-added services, including product demand data, inventory replenishment, single-source billing, third-party claims processing, real-time price and incentive updates, and price labels. \n\nU.S. Healthcare Solutions processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders, invoices, and payments electronically, and it continues to make substantial investments to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers. U.S. Healthcare Solutions has warehouse operating systems, which are used to manage the majority of its transactional volume. The warehouse operating systems have improved U.S. Healthcare Solutions&#8217; productivity and operating leverage. \n\nCompetition \n\nWe face a highly competitive global environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services. Our largest competitors are McKesson Corporation (\"McKesson\"), Cardinal Health, Inc. (\"Cardinal\"), and UPS Logistics, among others. Our U.S. human health distribution businesses compete with both McKesson and Cardinal, as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution. In addition, we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers, chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing, specialty distributors, and packaging and healthcare technology companies. Our consulting businesses, World Courier, MWI, and Alliance Healthcare also face competition from a variety of businesses. In all areas, competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nWe use a number of trademarks and service marks. All of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the United States and, in some cases, in foreign jurisdictions, or are the subject of pending applications for registration. \n\nWe have developed or acquired various proprietary products, processes, software, and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers. We generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret, patent and copyright laws, and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections. \n\nWe hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products, particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, our medication and supply dispensing equipment, certain warehousing equipment, and some \n\nTable of Contents \n\nof our proprietary packaging solutions. We seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate. \n\nAlthough we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties, third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time. \n\nHuman Capital Resources \n\nOur ability to succeed in the global marketplace directly depends on attracting and retaining a talented and skilled workforce. We aspire to accelerate business results by fostering a diverse and an inclusive workplace, where all members of our global talent are supported and inspired to perform at their full potential and contribute to our success as their authentic selves. \n\nWorkforce \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 44,000 employees, of which approximately 39,000 were full-time employees and approximately 39% were U.S.-based employees. \n\nApproximately 28% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, nearly all of whom are employees located outside of the United States. \n\nWe encourage and embrace different cultures and backgrounds, as we recognize the value of employing a workforce of unique and varying viewpoints and experiences. Individuals who self-identify as female make up the majority of AmerisourceBergen&#8217;s global workforce and Executive Management Committee, at 51% and 57%, respectively. Additionally, 50% of our U.S. workforce are individuals who self-identify as ethnically and/or racially diverse. We currently have two directors who self-identify as ethnically and/or racially diverse, and we currently have three directors who self-identify as female. In addition, the Company announced the election of a new female director, effective January 1, 2023. \n\nTalent Development \n\nWe consider employee development to be a strategic priority. We support employee growth and advancement by offering a variety of benefits to eligible full-time employees including, among others: \n\n&#8226; Leadership and professional development programs and resources; \n\n&#8226; Leadership and executive coaching; \n\n&#8226; Tuition reimbursement; \n\n&#8226; Opportunities to volunteer and participate in mentorship and support programs such as our Employee Resource Groups (&#8220;ERGs&#8221;); \n\n&#8226; Recognition for excellence, such as our annual Pursuit of Purpose awards and True Blue associate recognition program; and \n\n&#8226; Personalized learning and skill-building programs offered through our global learning experience platform. \n\nImportantly, we continue to make meaningful investments in supporting and building our talent and enhancing our culture. In fiscal 2022, we conducted an Employee Experience survey across the Company as a means to gauge employee satisfaction and identify areas in which we can enhance and improve employee experience. This survey also included a Global Inclusion Index that was comprised of questions designed to measure inclusion across the organization. The Employee Experience Survey is the foundation for our new employee listening strategy to ensure employee voices are heard and valued in shaping our Company&#8217;s culture. \n\nWe introduced our leadership model, which emphasizes people, collaboration, innovation, and purpose, to our team members in fiscal 2021 through a series of experiential learning programs. In fiscal year 2022, we continued to embed the Leadership Competency Model into our enterprise learning programs, talent processes, succession planning and leadership development. The ultimate goal of our leadership competency model is to help us unlock the full potential of our people and build the new skills and behaviors we need to achieve our enterprise strategy. \n\nOur overarching goal is to provide our team members with clear pathways for career development, access to programs and benefits that allow them to live fuller, healthier lives, and opportunities to participate in their communities in ways that are meaningful to them and inspire and celebrate their individuality. Our talent development programs are designed to help provide a supportive and engaging work environment where team members can excel, while remaining authentic and empowered to share their unique perspectives and experiences. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;) \n\nAt AmerisourceBergen, we are committed to fostering a global workplace that values diversity, equity, and inclusion by creating pathways for every team member to thrive, making a positive impact on our communities, and continuously enhancing our transparency and accountability. \n\nOur long-term DEI strategy is focused on four critical dimensions&#8212;people, culture, progress, and community&#8212;and is grounded in deep organizational insights, our people data, and industry research and benchmarks. In pursuit of this strategy, in 2022, we: \n\n&#8226; Refreshed the membership and mission of AmerisourceBergen&#8217;s DEI Global Council (the &#8220;DEI Council&#8221;) by expanding the membership of the DEI Council to include the Chair of each ERG and revising the DEI Council&#8217;s mission to specifically include identifying and amplifying areas of opportunity to advance our global diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy. \n\n&#8226; Published a dedicated DEI Summary Report on the Company&#8217;s website that highlights content from our Environmental, Social and Governance report, as a means to underscore our commitment to DEI, build trust and accountability through enhanced transparency, and monitor progress on our DEI goals. \n\n&#8226; Conducted the first Employee Experience Survey to, among other things, measure inclusion in our global culture. \n\n&#8226; Launched a Global Inclusion campaign, which includes a robust communication plan and action-oriented learning assets to empower our team members and inform inclusive leadership. \n\nIn addition to the foregoing, we offered a number of DEI programs and initiatives in fiscal 2022, including celebrating global inclusion in partnership with our ERGs by holding two global events: International Women&#8217;s Day in March and Pride Month in June. \n\nWe are proud that our DEI efforts continue to be recognized. The Human Rights Campaign awarded the Company a perfect score of 100% on its Corporate Equality Index for the fifth consecutive year and also listed us as one of the &#8220;Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.&#8221; \n\nCompetitive Compensation and Benefits \n\nWe are committed to ensuring equal opportunity and pay equity. We have implemented processes that are designed to drive equitable pay decisions and eliminate unexplained pay inequities. To further support this, AmerisourceBergen has a cross-functional team of leaders from the Global Compensation, Legal, and Human Resource departments that is responsible for researching best practices, reviewing pay practices, working with external resources to analyze current pay equity, and working with senior leaders to implement changes. As a result of these efforts, we have: \n\n&#8226; Modified promotional salary increase guidelines to help eliminate pay gaps; \n\n&#8226; Removed questions about pay history in the recruiting and interviewing processes of external candidates; \n\n&#8226; Adopted the practices of administering annual merit increases based on both performance and base pay within the pay range and making promotional salary increases based on market competitiveness and internal equity; and \n\n&#8226; Implemented annual assessments that identify potential pay gaps, with the goal of developing a plan to correct any identified pay gaps that are inexplicable. \n\nOur comprehensive benefit and compensation package offers the following to all eligible full-time team members: \n\n&#8226; Medical, dental, and vision care, life insurance and other income protection, a retirement plan with Company match, and a discounted employee stock purchase program; \n\n&#8226; An employee assistance program with free counseling sessions and unlimited digital mental health support, tuition assistance (including scholarships for dependents), medical coverage for same and opposite gender domestic partners, and holidays and paid time off; \n\n&#8226; Infertility coverage and family building counseling services, as well as reimbursement for adoption expenses; \n\n&#8226; Counseling and education guidance benefits to support the needs of team members and dependents with developmental and cognitive challenges; and \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; Effective January 1, 2023, a minimum of twelve weeks of paid parental leave following birth, adoption, or surrogacy for both parents. \n\nWe offer postpartum support and return-to-work assistance, including on-site lactation rooms and flexible work arrangements, such as flex hours. For nursing moms who travel for work, we offer a service to ship breast milk back to their homes. We also offer back-up child and elder care, plus discounts on services, such as childcare, saving for college, and tutoring. Beginning in 2023, we will offer two weeks of paid caregiver leave to care for a family member who has a serious health condition. \n\nWe also believe it is important to invest in the health and wellness of our team members. Our myWellbeing program focuses on the physical, emotional, financial, and social aspects of wellness. Team members can earn points towards a reduction in health insurance premium costs by completing activities, such as monthly challenges, financial training, and getting preventive exams and screenings. We also offer diabetes, weight management, and musculoskeletal programs for team members and their dependents. To help team members navigate the often-confusing healthcare system, we provide a navigation and advocacy service to assist in finding the right care, obtaining a medical second opinion, and understanding confusing medical bills. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, when we initiated our return-to-office protocol, we adopted WorkSmart, a principled work-from-home flexibility program for those team members whose work does not require them to be at one of our physical locations. WorkSmart is based our philosophy and approach to employee satisfaction and provides team members flexibility in how and where work is completed. \n\nSafety and COVID-19 \n\nWe are committed to the safety and wellbeing of our team members. In addition to utilizing a peer-to-peer safety program, we regularly convene our company leaders to review and evaluate safety data and issue operational excellence scorecards. Distribution center team members receive training on proper safety procedures and incentive opportunities, with safety performance tracked and shared across the organization. \n\nIn connection with prioritizing safety, we continue to follow clinical and regulatory guidance as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continuously monitor guidance on COVID-19 safety and look for ways to enhance our safety protocols. \n\nTo further support our team members during the COVID-19 pandemic, we enhanced our benefit offerings (which are discussed above) to provide greater access to mental health telemedicine, additional paid time off for those needing to self-quarantine or care for a family member, and access to mindfulness videos and other wellness resources. Additionally, team members whose household income was impacted, such as by a spouse experiencing job loss, were offered financial support through the AmerisourceBergen Associate Assistance Fund. \n\nGovernment Regulation \n\nWe are subject to extensive oversight by United States, United Kingdom and European Union governmental entities and we are subject to, and affected by, a variety of laws, regulations, and policies. \n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), the U.S. Department of Justice, and various other federal and state authorities regulate the purchase, storage, and/or distribution of pharmaceutical products, including controlled substances. Wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid DEA licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, and distribution of controlled substances. \n\nWe and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act. The anti-kickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing, leasing, or ordering, induce a referral to purchase, lease, or order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting, or causing the submission, of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government and authorizes treble damages and substantial civil penalties in the case of violations. The fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation. \n\nIn recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated, or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. At the federal level, the supply chain security legislation known as the Drug Quality and Security Act (&#8220;DQSA&#8221;) became law in 2013. Title II of the DQSA, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (&#8220;DSCSA&#8221;), establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot \n\nTable of Contents \n\nlevel, preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and requires all supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system. The DSCSA also establishes requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed third-party logistics providers. The FDA, and eventually all comparable state agencies, will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and third-party logistics providers. There can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with DQSA requirements, or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements, and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our operations into compliance. These and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations. \n\nThe regulation of public and private health insurance and benefit programs can also affect our business, and scrutiny of the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems in the United States, including those related to the importation and reimportation of certain drugs from foreign markets, can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels. This process may result in additional legislation and/or regulation governing the production, delivery, or pricing of pharmaceutical products and other healthcare services. In addition, changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate certain of our distribution centers, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nAny future reductions in Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us. We cannot predict what additional initiatives, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. \n\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices. \n\nThe costs, burdens, and/or impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nSee &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of additional legal and regulatory developments, as well as enforcement actions or other litigation that may arise out of our failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nHealth Information and Privacy Practices \n\nThe Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) and its implementing regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of protected health information, as defined under the HIPAA regulations. Some of our businesses collect, maintain, and/or access protected health information and are subject to the HIPAA regulations. Our operations, depending on their location, may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided. Significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of HIPAA standards and other such laws. We have a HIPAA compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the HIPAA regulations. \n\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH Act&#8221;) strengthened federal privacy and security provisions governing protected health information. Among other things, the HITECH Act expanded certain aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security rules, imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches, broadened the rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) to enforce HIPAA, and directed HHS to publish more specific security standards. In January 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of HHS published the HIPAA omnibus final rule (&#8220;HIPAA Final Rule&#8221;), which amended certain aspects of the HIPAA privacy, security, and enforcement rules pursuant to the HITECH Act, extending certain HIPAA obligations to business associates and their subcontractors. Certain components of our business act as &#8220;business associates&#8221; within the meaning of HIPAA and are subject to these additional obligations under the HIPAA Final Rule. \n\nSome of our businesses collect, maintain, and/or access other personal information (including sensitive personal information) that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information, in addition to the requirements of HIPAA, the HITECH Act, and the implementing regulations. Personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate and many of these laws place restrictions on the transfer of personal information to other jurisdictions. As such regulations continue to evolve, we must comply with applicable privacy and security requirements of these countries, including but not limited to those in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Most notably certain aspects of our business are subject to the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) which became effective on May 25, 2018, the UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act of 2018, the California Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which became effective on January 1, 2020, and Brazil&#8217;s General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote&#231;&#227;o de Dados Pessoais) &#8211; Law No. 13,709/208 (&#8220;LGPD&#8221;) which became effective in August 2020. On November 3, 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act of \n\nTable of Contents \n\n2020 (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which amends the CCPA and adds new privacy protections that will become effective on January 1, 2023, was enacted through a ballot initiative. Similarly, Virginia (the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, effective on January 1, 2023), Colorado (the Colorado Privacy Act, effective on July 1, 2023), Connecticut (the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, effective on July 1, 2023), and Utah (the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, effective December 31, 2023) have also enacted similarly situated data protection laws. Other states and countries continue to enact similar legislation. We have implemented a privacy and information security compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the applicable privacy laws and regulations. There can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements will not impose new costs on our business. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nFor more information about us, visit our website at www.amerisourcebergen.com .

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nThe following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects. These risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. The reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. \n\nBusiness and Operational Risks \n\nOur revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss, or renewal at less favorable terms, of a significant customer or group purchasing organization. \n\nWBA accounted for approximately 27% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Express Scripts accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Our top ten customers, including governmental agencies, represented approximately 66% of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. We have distributor relationships with GPOs in multiple distribution segments. We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or GPO prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. A number of our contracts with significant customers or GPOs are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or GPO relationships if we are unable to extend, renew, renegotiate or replace the contracts. The loss of any significant customer or GPO relationship could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be renewed or modified prior to their expiration date in furtherance of our strategic objectives. If those contracts are renewed or modified at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nThe anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with WBA may not be realized. \n\nIn June 2021, we extended to 2029 our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to Walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH (&#8220;WBAD&#8221;) provides a variety of services, including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf. This reflected our continued expectation that partnering strategically with WBA will result in various benefits including continued cost savings and initiatives designed to create incremental growth and efficiencies in sourcing, logistics and distribution. We also entered into a distribution agreement pursuant to which we will supply branded and generic pharmaceutical products to WBA&#8217;s Boots UK Ltd. subsidiary through 2031. The processes needed to achieve and maintain these initiatives and benefits are complex, costly, and time-consuming. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangements on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including: the potential inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with WBAD, including improved generic drug pricing and terms, improved service fees from generic manufacturers, cost savings, innovations, or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected; the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the extension of the duration of our distribution agreement for Walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services agreement with WBAD and the respective terms thereunder, including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational, strategic or financial flexibility; potential changes in supplier relationships and terms; unexpected or unforeseen costs, fees, expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship; changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to Walgreens pharmacies in the United States or to pharmacies operated by Boots UK Ltd. in the United Kingdom, including changes necessitated by changing market conditions or other unforeseen developments that may arise during the term of either distribution agreement, to the extent that any such changes are not offset by other financial benefits that we are able to obtain through collaboration in other aspects of our strategic relationship with WBA; and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with WBA in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship. \n\nIn addition, WBA has the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated March 18, 2013 and the Amended and Restated AmerisourceBergen Shareholders Agreement dated June 1, 2021, as further amended on August 2, 2022 (the &#8220;Shareholders Agreement&#8221;), to make certain additional investments in our common stock. WBA also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as WBA has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the Shareholders Agreement, subject to certain restrictions on the number of shares that may be sold at any given time. For example, in November 2022, WBA sold 13.2 million shares of our common stock. Any sales of common stock by WBA could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances, or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with WBA. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncosts, decreased revenue, decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve any of our objectives, the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nA disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with WBA could adversely affect our business and financial results. \n\nWe are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for WBA in the United States and the United Kingdom. If our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason deemed within our control, we may have an obligation to pay or credit WBA for failure to supply products. In addition, upon the expiration or termination of our distribution agreement for Walgreens pharmacies, our distribution agreement with Boots UK Ltd. or our generics purchasing services arrangement with WBAD, there can be no assurance that we or WBA will be willing to renew, on terms favorable to us or at all. \n\nOur generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with WBAD. If the operations of WBA are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether by the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory or governmental action, or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability. Moreover, if the economic benefits we are able to obtain through the generics purchasing services arrangement with WBA decline due to changes in market conditions or other changes impacting the fees and rebates that generic manufacturers make available through the arrangement, our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, our business may be adversely affected by any operational, financial, or regulatory difficulties that WBA experiences, including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the DEA and/or state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies. \n\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of or investments in businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate. \n\nAs part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of and investments in other companies. At any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion, and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments, not all of which will be consummated. We make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations. On June 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare from WBA for $5,596.7 million in net cash, $229.1 million of the our common stock, and $6.1 million of other equity consideration (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). On September 12, 2022, we announced our intent to acquire PharmaLex Holding GmbH (&#8220;PharmaLex&#8221;) for &#8364;1,280 million in cash, subject to certain customary adjustments. The PharmaLex transaction is expected to close by March 2023 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. Alliance Healthcare and PharmaLex operate in the United Kingdom, Germany, a number of other countries in the European Union, and in select other markets. We may find that our ability to integrate and control Alliance Healthcare and PharmaLex is more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected, especially in certain countries where our investment is not wholly-owned, such as our 50%-owned Alliance Healthcare Egypt subsidiary. Each of Alliance Healthcare and PharmaLex may fail to achieve its expected future financial and operating performance and results and the acquisitions may have the effect of disrupting relationships with employees, suppliers, and other business partners. \n\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses or in regions in which we lack operational or market experience. Acquired companies may have business practices that we are not accustomed to or have unique terms and conditions with their business partners. As a result of the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and other future acquisitions, including PharmaLex, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: regulatory or compliance issues that could arise; changes in regulations and laws; the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities, including litigation risks; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated; the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions. Our businesses operate in a number of jurisdictions, including Egypt and other locations, that have a higher business, operating and regulatory risk profile than the United States and European Union jurisdictions. Such risks may include risks of violation of United States, United Kingdom and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and international trade laws. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are not able to effectively put in place effective financial controls and compliance policies to safeguard against such risks as part of our integration of businesses, including Alliance Healthcare. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures. \n\nWe regularly evaluate our portfolio to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. Further, divestitures may be delayed due to failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or may become more difficult to execute due to conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction. The impact of a divestiture on our results of operations could also be greater than anticipated. \n\nOur results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations. \n\nWe conduct operations in over 50 countries, which subjects us to various risks inherent in global operations. We may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future, which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above. At any particular time, our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws, regulations, and political and economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility, and competition, as well as business and operational decisions made by joint venture partners. For example, during fiscal 2022, Turkey became a &#8220;highly inflationary economy,&#8221; as defined under U.S. GAAP, which impacted our consolidated financial statements. \n\nFurthermore, geopolitical dynamics caused by political, economic, social or other conditions in foreign countries and regions may impact our business and results of operations. During fiscal 2022, we have experienced increased costs, including for fuel, and it is possible that we could experience supply disruptions or shortages if tariffs or other protective measures are enacted. Significantly higher and sustained rates of inflation, with subsequent increases in operational costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or any other current or future acts of terrorism, war (such as the ongoing Russia and Ukraine war), and other events (such as economic sanctions and trade restrictions, including those related to the on-going Russia and Ukraine war) may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or could otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. \n\nChanges or uncertainty in U.S. policies or policies in other countries and regions in which we do business, including any changes or uncertainty with respect to U.S. or international trade policies or tariffs, also can disrupt our global operations, as well as our customers and suppliers, in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations. \n\nWe might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nWe conduct our business in various currencies, including the U.S. Dollar, the Euro, the U.K. Pound Sterling, the Turkish Lira, the Egyptian Pound, the Brazilian Real, and the Canadian Dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollars. We may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts, foreign currency borrowings or other techniques intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. These hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place. Any of these risks might have an adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nWe might be adversely impacted by the January 2020 withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. \n\nWe have continued to expand our operations in the United Kingdom and the European Union and face risks associated with the uncertainty and potential disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;). We continue to believe Brexit could adversely affect political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. For example, we might experience volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and changes in laws regulating our United Kingdom operations as well as sourcing disruptions and associated pricing volatility. Customers might reduce purchases due to the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. Similar future trade disruptions or disputes could have a negative impact on our operations in the United Kingdom and European Union and other parts of the world. \n\nWe are subject to operational and logistical risks that might not be covered by insurance. \n\nWe have distribution centers and facilities located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and throughout the world. Our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and the provision \n\nTable of Contents \n\nof related services, including cold chain storage and shipping. The volume of cold chain storage and shipping has increased in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the requirements for distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and certain treatments. We expect this trend to continue. Although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage, coverage on acceptable terms might be unavailable, coverage might not cover our losses, coverage might be significantly more costly or may require large deductibles. \n\nAdditionally, we seek to maintain coverage for risks associated with cybersecurity, but such insurance has become increasingly difficult to secure and, in some cases, policies may not provide adequate coverage for possible losses. Uninsured losses or operational losses that result from large deductible payments under commercial insurance coverage might have an adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. \n\nWe might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees. \n\nOur ability to attract, engage, develop and retain qualified and experienced employees, including key executives and other talent, is essential for us to meet our objectives. We compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees. Competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries, benefits or other employee-related costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain employees. We may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes, such as illness, and must adequately plan for succession of key management roles. Employees might not successfully transition into new roles. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. \n\nAdditionally, approximately 28% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, nearly all of whom are employees located outside of the United States. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good but if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements, such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nIndustry and Economic Risks \n\nOur results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes. \n\nOur contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products in the United States generally use wholesale acquisition cost (&#8220;WAC&#8221;) as the reference price. We sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using WAC as the reference price and to other customers based on their negotiated contract price. If manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to WAC or if prices charged by manufacturers do not align with prices negotiated to be paid by our customers, and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, there are a number of U.S. government policy initiatives being considered which, if enacted, could directly or indirectly regulate or impact WAC prices. If such initiatives are passed or finalized and we are unable to negotiate equitable changes with our suppliers and/or customers, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. \n\nThe pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation. Additionally, certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them. As a result, our gross profit from brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases, which we do not control. If the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows, whether due to regulatory mandates, the implementation of legislative proposals, policy initiatives or voluntary manufacturer actions, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation. If the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater. \n\nCompetition and industry consolidation may erode our profit. \n\nAs described in greater detail in the &#8220;Competition&#8221; section, the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. In addition, the healthcare industry continues to experience increasing consolidation, including through the formation of strategic alliances among pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies, healthcare providers and health insurers, which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business. Continued consolidation within the healthcare industry could adversely affect our results of operations, to the extent we experience reduced negotiating power or possible customer losses. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOur revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant customer. \n\nMost of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit. Credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness. Although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure, we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured. Volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes, including changes in reimbursement, may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility of the capital and credit markets and has led to a general worsening of economic conditions, which has put financial pressure on many of our customers and may threaten certain customers&#8217; ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to repay their obligations to us as they become due. The bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations. As of September 30, 2022, our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 38% and 7% of accounts receivable, net. \n\nOur results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant supplier. \n\nOur relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers, including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods, chargebacks, and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers. Volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, pending litigation, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers. The bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier could have an adverse effect on the supply or availability of products which may cause supply chain disruptions and increases in the price of substitutes or alternatives. \n\nOur stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption or a downgrade in our credit ratings. \n\nIf the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future, there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access credit. Although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs, there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing, impair our liquidity, or adversely impact our business. \n\nAdditionally, rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to us and our outstanding debt securities. To maintain our ratings, we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios. Liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlements, an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, could limit our access to public debt markets, limit the institutions willing to provide credit to us, result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt, and would likely increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings. \n\nDeclining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOur operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the United States and other countries or regions where we do business. Deterioration in general economic conditions, whether due to COVID-19 or otherwise, could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. Negative trends in the general economy, including interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility, or credit market disruptions, may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flows from operations. Bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. Declining economic conditions or increases in inflation may also increase our costs. If the economic conditions in the United States or in the countries or regions where we do business deteriorate, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks \n\nIncreasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability. \n\nThe healthcare industry in the United States, as well as in the other countries and regions in which we do business, is highly regulated at many levels of government. There have been increasing efforts in the United States by Congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy, departments of health, the FDA, DEA, and TSA, and by similar regulators in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other countries, to regulate the pharmaceutical supply chain. Regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, as well as provide assurance over the integrity of products traversing the supply chain. Consequently, we are subject to the risk of changes in various laws, which include operating, record keeping, and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies. In recent years, some governments have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution. \n\nAt the federal level, in the United States, the DSCSA establishes national traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the bottle level, preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and requires all supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system by November 2023. The DSCSA also establishes requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed third-party logistics providers. The FDA, and eventually all comparable state agencies, will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and third-party logistics providers. Most recently, on February 4, 2022, the FDA issued a proposed rule, which, when finalized, will establish the national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistics providers. \n\nFailure to comply with the DQSA requirements or with additional similar governmental regulatory and licensing requirements may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance. Our international operations may also be subject to local regulations containing record-keeping and other obligations related to our distribution operations in those locations. For example, in 2019, the safety features of the Falsified Medicines Directive became operational in EU member states, which consists of placing a unique identifier (a two-dimensional barcode) and an anti-tampering device on the outer packaging of medicines. Pedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs and could have an adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. \n\nAs discussed in the risk factor below about public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, certain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the United States. In addition to conducting investigations and participating in litigation related to the misuse of prescription opioid medications, federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are considering legislation and regulatory measures to limit opioid prescriptions and more closely monitor product distribution, prescribing, and dispensing of these drugs. \n\nComplying with the DQSA requirements, including the DSCSA requirements, and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution requirements, including follow-on actions related to current public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nLegal, regulatory, and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement, pricing, and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including through declining reimbursement rates. \n\nBoth our business and our customers' businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined, or regulating pricing, contracting, and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services. Additionally, on occasion, price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of governmental inquiries, national, federal and state investigations and private litigation. Any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement, such as pricing controls or indexing models at a national, federal or state level, could adversely affect our operations. \n\nIn the European Union, many governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs. In most EU member states, for example, the government regulates pricing of a new pharmaceutical product at launch often through direct price controls, international price comparisons, controlling profits and/or reference pricing. Some European governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending such as volume discounts, cost caps, cost sharing for increases in excess of prior year costs for individual products or aggregated market level spending, outcome-based pricing schemes and free products for a portion of the expected therapy period. All of these measures exert pressure on the \n\nTable of Contents \n\npricing and reimbursement levels for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices. \n\nIn the United States, federal insurance and healthcare reform legislation known as the Affordable Care Act (&#8220;ACA&#8221;) became law in March 2010, and included numerous reforms broadening healthcare access and affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, pricing, and contracting for prescription drugs, including changes to the Medicaid rebate statute. We cannot predict the impact that any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the ACA may have on the ACA or other healthcare legislation and regulation. \n\nSubsequent legislation has made additional changes to federal drug payment policies, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which increased the Medicaid rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs. The federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact Medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs. Any reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multiple source pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in Medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business. Unless we are able to successfully advocate to prevent or mitigate the impact of these legislative and regulatory changes, these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nMore recently, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (&#8220;IRA&#8221;), an omnibus budget law which contains significant reforms affecting prescription drug pricing and reimbursement. These reforms include: (i) manufacturer inflation rebates on drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D, to the extent such products&#8217; prices increase faster than the rate of consumer price inflation, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 for Part D drugs and the first quarter of 2023 for Part B drugs; (ii) limits on Medicare Part B and Part D patients&#8217; cost sharing for insulin, beginning in 2023; (iii) Medicare Part D benefit redesign beginning in 2024, including replacement of the &#8220;coverage gap discounts&#8221; that pharmaceutical manufacturers currently pay with new mandatory manufacturer discounts applicable during all phases of the Part D benefit after satisfaction of the deductible, beginning in 2025; and (iv) federal price negotiation of &#8220;maximum fair prices&#8221; for certain &#8220;selected&#8221; high-expenditure drugs under Medicare Parts D and B, applicable beginning in 2026 for Part D drugs and 2028 for Part B drugs, under which maximum fair prices must be made available to pharmacies, physicians, and other entities dispensing or providing drugs covered under Medicare Parts D and B. Although the primary effects of the IRA reforms will be felt by manufacturers, these changes may impact our customer pricing structures, our manufacturer distribution relationships and revenue, our customers' billing processes and reimbursement amounts, and drug prices more generally (including outside of the Medicare context). Among other issues, the mechanisms by which maximum fair prices will be made available to pharmacies, physicians and other purchasers of selected drugs, and our associated role and responsibilities, remain to be determined. More broadly, the law contains reimbursement and pricing incentives designed to promote biosimilar introduction and competition which may affect our customers&#8217; selection of products. Each of these considerations, as well as other issues that may arise in connection with the implementation of the IRA, may adversely affect our operations and profitability. \n\nOur businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians, hospitals, community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under Part B of the Medicare program. The Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) published a final rule in November 2017 that reduces Medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs (other than vaccines) purchased through the 340B drug discount program from average sales price (&#8220;ASP&#8221;) plus 6% to ASP minus 22.5% (with certain exceptions), effective January 2018. Subsequently, CMS issued proposed rules for later years containing similar reductions in hospital outpatient payments for 340B drugs. In June 2022, the United States Supreme Court ruled in American Hospital Association v. Becerra that CMS&#8217;s final rule was inconsistent with the Medicare statute and was therefore invalid. Following the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision, CMS published a proposed rule for the calendar year 2023 hospital outpatient payment system, which did not propose a specific &#8220;refund&#8221; mechanism to implement reimbursement provisions consistent with the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision but advised the public that the final rule is likely to include such a mechanism and solicited comments on particular approaches. While the Court&#8217;s decision (if fully implemented by CMS) removes the reimbursement restrictions for 340B products affecting our customers and indirectly the company, there can be no assurance that recent or future rules established by CMS will not have an adverse impact on our business. \n\nFurther, even where a government does not affirmatively change drug price regulation standards, other parties in the drug manufacturing and distribution system may change their interpretation or approach to implementing or complying with those standards, in a manner that may adversely affect our business. For example, the 340B drug discount program requires manufacturers to provide discounts on outpatient drugs to &#8220;covered entity&#8221; safety net providers, and previous Health Resources and Services Administration (&#8220;HRSA&#8221;) guidance has allowed covered entities to dispense 340B discounted drugs through arrangements with multiple &#8220;contract pharmacies.&#8221; Recently, several manufacturers have announced initiatives that may inhibit or limit covered entities&#8217; ability to use any, or multiple, contract pharmacies, may place conditions on the use of contract \n\nTable of Contents \n\npharmacies, or direct us not to honor 340B discounted pricing requests on orders to be shipped to contract pharmacies (or may not honor chargebacks where such discounts are extended to contract pharmacies). Since these manufacturer policies were first announced, both manufacturers and covered entities have filed lawsuits against HRSA regarding the contract pharmacy policy, which are currently pending, in several federal district and appellate courts, and HRSA has also advised certain manufacturers that it was referring their policies to the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services for potential civil money penalty enforcement proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. Our customers include covered entities and organizations with significant participation as contract pharmacies, and the unavailability of 340B discounts through contract pharmacy arrangements may adversely affect such customers and, therefore, could adversely affect our business. \n\nThe federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. Any future reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates or modifications to Medicare drug pricing regulations such as ASP calculations, or the extension of IRA pricing reforms to commercial health plans, could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us, or could indirectly affect the structure of our relationships with manufacturers and our customers. At this time, we can provide no assurances that future Medicare, Medicaid or other insurance payment or policy changes, if adopted, would not have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nFinally, federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which may adversely affect our business. For example, several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases, while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multi-payer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. On July 31, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a &#8220;Safe Importation Action Plan&#8221; that outlines two potential pathways to allow importation of certain drugs from foreign markets. Following this framework, the FDA proposed a draft rule in December 2019 that would allow importation of certain lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada, and in September 2020 the rulemaking was finalized by the FDA along with an industry guidance document. Under the rule, states or certain other non-federal governmental entities would be able to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization of two-year programs (with the opportunity to extend for two more years). The new rule became effective on November 30, 2020, although its implementation has been delayed and its impact is uncertain, in part because lawsuits have been filed challenging the government&#8217;s authority to promulgate it. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. Despite the ongoing litigation, on July 9, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order pertaining to drug pricing that directs the Commissioner of the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes to facilitate the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. In March 2022, FDA met with representatives from Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico and Vermont to provide assistance in developing importation proposals. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect our business. The regulatory and market implications of the final rule and guidance are unknown at this time. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for products and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability. \n\nThere can be no assurances that future changes to drug reimbursement policies, drug pricing and contracting practices outside of federal healthcare programs, or to government drug price regulation programs such as the Medicaid rebate, ASP, or 340B program will not have an adverse impact on our business. \n\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. \n\nWe are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The U.S. federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, (i) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid programs. Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse, and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the ACA. Many states have enacted similar statutes which are not necessarily limited to items and services for which payment is made by federal healthcare programs. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to certain \n\nTable of Contents \n\nincentives offered in connection with sales of pharmaceutical products and related services, are vague or indefinite, and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal, state, or governmental healthcare programs. \n\nOur business, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings. \n\nDue to the nature of our operations, which we conduct through a variety of businesses, including the distribution of pharmaceuticals, the dispensing of healthcare products, and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry, each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in government investigations, legal disputes or proceedings. These investigations, disputes or proceedings have involved or may involve healthcare fraud and abuse, the False Claims Act, antitrust, class action, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, public disclosures and various other claims, including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the risk factor below. \n\nLitigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Litigation is costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to ordinary business operations. The defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Violations of various laws, including with respect to the marketing, sale, purchase, and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry, can result in criminal, civil, and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages, criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs. Any settlement, judgment or fine could materially adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nStatutory and/or regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints. The qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil False Claims Acts authorize a private person, known as a relator, to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments. Under False Claims Acts, the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action. Such cases may involve allegations around the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of brand and/or generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry. Such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims, if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters, and/or if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters. \n\nIn fiscal 2018, we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into, among other things, a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Corporate Integrity Agreement has a five-year term. Failure to comply with obligations under the Corporate Integrity Agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties. \n\nOpioid-related legal proceedings and the comprehensive settlement agreement that we have entered into could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations. \n\nOn July 21, 2021, we announced that AmerisourceBergen and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement that would result in the resolution of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;). On April 2, 2022, the Settlement Agreement became effective, and as of September 30, 2022, it included 48 of 49 eligible states (the &#8220;Settling States&#8221;), as well as 99% by population of the eligible political subdivisions in the Settling States. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and related agreements with Settling States, we will pay up to approximately $6.4 billion over 18 years and comply with other requirements, including establishment of a clearinghouse that will consolidate data from all three national distributors. The Settlement Agreement does not contemplate participation by any non-governmental or non-political entities or individuals. Our estimated liability related to the State of Alabama (with whom we have not reached a settlement agreement), as well as other opioid-related litigation for which we have reached settlements agreements, is approximately $0.4 billion. \n\nNet of $0.8 billion of payments made through September 30, 2022,we have a $6.0 billion liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 for litigation relating to the Settlement Agreement, as well as other opioid-related litigation. We currently estimate that $528.7 million will be paid prior to September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining long-term liability of $5.5 billion is recorded in Accrued Litigation Liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. While we have accrued an estimated liability for opioid litigation, we are unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with the matters that are not included in the settlement accrual. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the \n\nTable of Contents \n\nassessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events, and the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued to date. Until such time as otherwise resolved, we will continue to litigate and prepare for trial and to vigorously defend ourself in all such matters. Since these matters are still developing, we are unable to predict the outcome, but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows and could result in a lower than historical level of capital available for deployment, including a lower level of capital returned to stockholders. Further details on the Settlement Agreement and opioid litigation are provided in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPublic concern over the abuse of opioid medications, including increased legal and regulatory action, could negatively affect our business. \n\nCertain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the United States. Federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the pharmaceutical supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, national retail pharmacy chains, independent pharmacies, prescribers, and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, regarding the manufacture, dispensing, and distribution of opioid medications. In addition, a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us, other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, and others in the pharmaceutical supply chain by state and local governmental entities and other plaintiffs for claims related to the Company&#8217;s distribution of opioid medications. The lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege, among other claims, that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances, acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances, and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations. Additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future, and lawsuits could be brought against the Company by other plaintiffs under other theories related to opioid abuse. We are deeply committed to diversion control efforts, have sophisticated systems to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious (including through the use of data analytics), and engage in due diligence and ongoing monitoring of customers. In addition to the claims brought by states and other local governmental entities, we are also being sued by private plaintiffs, such as unions, other health and welfare funds, hospital systems, third party payors, other healthcare providers and individuals alleging personal injury for the same activities, and continue to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits. \n\nIn April 2022, the Settlement Agreement described above, which settles the vast majority of opioid-related lawsuits filed against us by state and local governmental entities, became effective. The Settlement Agreement includes a cash component, pursuant to which we will pay up to approximately $6.4 billion, the majority of which we expect to be paid over 18 years. The Settlement Agreement also includes injunctive relief terms relating to distributors&#8217; controlled substance anti-diversion programs, including with respect to: (i) governance; (ii) independence and training of the personnel operating controlled substances monitoring programs; (iii) due diligence for new and existing customers; (iv) ordering limits for certain products; and (v) suspicious order monitoring. A monitor will oversee compliance with these provisions for a period of five years. In addition, the distributors will engage a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which the distributors will fund for ten years. It is possible that the implementation and maintenance of the required changes to distributors&#8217; controlled substance anti-diversion programs may result in unforeseen costs or operational challenges which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or performance. \n\nLegislative, regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict. Certain jurisdictions have enacted, and others are considering, legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states. If additional state or local jurisdictions enact legislation that taxes or assesses the sale or distribution of opioid medications and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted, such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. \n\nOngoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications, as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits, investigations, regulations and legislative actions, and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations. \n\nTax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, and various foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. In August 2022, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. This law, among other \n\nTable of Contents \n\nthings, provides for a corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income and an excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. We are continuing to evaluate the impact this new law may have on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, there are several proposed changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax legislation, which if enacted, could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate. Foreign governments may enact tax laws that could result in further changes to global taxation that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results. \n\nAn increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices, that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in material tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. \n\nThere can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives both within the United States and other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. While we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. \n\nDue to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof, the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our business and intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share, as well as our cash flows. \n\nViolations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and/or international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;), U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. We may also have substantial liability if a third party acting on our behalf or on the behalf of our subsidiaries (including our joint venture partners) is in violation of these laws. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses. We have business operations in many countries worldwide, including business operations in Egypt (through our 50%-owned Alliance Healthcare Egypt subsidiary) as well as Brazil and Turkey, and other countries that are considered to have business environments with higher risk of conduct that could give rise to potential violations and liabilities. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations. \n\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. \n\nGiven the nature of our business, we, together with third parties acting on our behalf, receive, collect, process, use, and retain sensitive and confidential customer and employee data, in addition to proprietary business information. Some of our third-party service providers, such as identity verification and payment processing providers, also regularly have access to customer data. Additionally, we maintain other confidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business and from third parties. \n\nGlobal privacy, cybersecurity and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly. The interpretation and application of these laws in some \n\nTable of Contents \n\ninstances is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the United States and beyond that regulate the collection, use, security, processing, and transfer of personal data, including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries. Many of these regulations also grant rights to individuals. Many foreign data privacy regulations (including, without limitation, GDPR in the European Union, UK GDPR, Brazil&#8217;s General Data Protection Law, LGPD, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada) and certain state laws and regulations (including California&#8217;s CCPA and recently enacted consumer privacy laws in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia) impose requirements beyond those enacted under United States federal law including, in some instances, private rights of action. For example, the EU GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements, including a broader scope of protected data, restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal data and more onerous breach reporting requirements, and the EU GDPR imposes greater penalties for non-compliance than the federal data protection laws in the United States. Other states and countries continue to enact similar legislation. We are also required to comply with expanding and increasingly complex cybersecurity regulations in the United States and abroad with respect to reporting adverse events and additional requirements for avoiding or responding to an adverse event. We may also face audits or investigations by domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties. We also have contractual obligations to our customers related to the protection of personal data and compliance with privacy laws. The foregoing or other circumstances related to our collection, use, and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market and/or adversely affect our business and financial position. \n\nOther Risks \n\nThe loss or disruption of information systems could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nOur businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; to receive, process, and ship orders on a timely basis; to account for other product and service transactions with customers; to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. We continue to make substantial investments in data centers and information systems, including, but not limited to, those relating to our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. To the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail, or to the extent there are data center interruptions or outages, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a third-party service provider does not perform satisfactorily, or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events, including due to the actions of third parties. \n\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of cloud-based infrastructure and other services, new technologies, and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. Security incidents such as ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, as well as increasingly difficult to detect. These risks have increased with the growth of our business, including as we integrate the information systems of acquired businesses, such as Alliance Healthcare, into our enterprise. \n\nIn addition, security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. We, and our third-party service providers, may experience cyberattacks aimed at disrupting services. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent actions by our employees, third-party service providers or their personnel or other parties. A failure, interruption, or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data, damage our reputation, cause loss of customers or revenue, increase our costs, result in litigation and/or regulatory action, and/or cause other losses, any of which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures, controls and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. \n\nOur failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. \n\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation is critical to our ability to expand and retain our customer base, strategic partnerships and other key relationships. Any negative publicity about us or the industry in which we operate we offer may adversely impact our business and operations. Furthermore, failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting, or environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various \n\nTable of Contents \n\nadverse actions, including litigation. Negative claims or publicity, including those made on social media, also could adversely affect our reputation and business, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. \n\nOur reputation may also depend on the success of our environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) initiatives, inclusive of sustainability, social impact and corporate responsibility, which require company-wide coordination and alignment. Risks associated with these initiatives include increased focus on ESG targets, goals and disclosure, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, increased costs associated with sustainability efforts, and compliance with laws and regulations. All of the foregoing could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. Any ESG or sustainability metrics that we currently or may in the future disclose, whether based on the standards we set for ourselves or those set by others, may influence our reputation and the value of our brands. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders, on ESG matters, including the use of materials, climate change, waste generation, supply chain, human capital, health equity and worker safety. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not, or are perceived to not, act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. \n\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse effects on our business. \n\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, including risks related to any responses thereto by the federal, state or foreign governments as well as customers and suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations, supply chains and distribution network, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in supply and demand for certain of our products and services. Further, it is possible that the manufacturers that produce the products that we distribute may experience delays or shutdowns due to COVID-19, such as from disruptions in their supply chains or in a suspension of production at their own facilities. Accordingly, we expect the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to adversely affect the supply of products and/or potentially disrupt our ability to deliver products to customers. The implementation of any government-mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees. Any extended disruption in our ability to service our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nOur management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. This may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. In addition, issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us. We also face risks related to a downturn in our customers&#8217; respective businesses, including the operations of retail pharmacy and health systems customers due to COVID-19. An economic slowdown or recession related to COVID-19 may affect our customers&#8217; ability to obtain credit to finance their business on acceptable terms, which could, in turn, result in reduced spending. \n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the resurgence of COVID-19 and its variants in regions recovering from the impacts of the pandemic, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the speed at which populations are vaccinated around the globe, the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity and regulatory actions taken to contain the impact of COVID-19 on public health and the global economy. We have implemented measures designed to keep our employees safe and have protocols in place to address business continuity issues at our distribution centers and other locations, but a widespread or sustained outbreak of COVID-19 at one or more locations could disrupt our ability to service our customers or attract and retain the necessary workforce. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section, any of which could have a material effect on us. \n\nOur goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets may become impaired, which may require us to record a further significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) require us to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends, including rising interest rates, or a significant decline in our stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. In addition, we periodically review our intangible and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value. The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and judgments by management. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nFor example, as a result of a prolonged decline in Profarma&#8217;s stock price, we performed an impairment assessment over our Profarma reporting unit as of June 30, 2022. As a result of the June 30, 2022 interim test, we recorded a $75.9 million impairment to goodwill in fiscal 2022. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets is determined. Any such charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. \n\nNatural disasters or other unexpected events, including those related to climate change, may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be covered by insurance. \n\nWe continue to focus on strategies and systems, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and packaging waste, to address climate change. However, we face climate and environmental risks and the occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, drought, storms, sea level rise, floods, and other severe hazards or accidents in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union or in other countries or regions in which we operate could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of distribution centers or outsourcing facilities, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products, delay in the delivery of products to our distribution centers, and/or disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers. Current or future insurance arrangements may not provide protection for costs that may arise from such events, particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination. Further, the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical distribution industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses. Any long-term disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more distribution centers or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOverview \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained herein. \n\nWe are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. \n\nWe are organized geographically based upon the products and services we provide to our customers. At the beginning of fiscal 2022, we re-aligned our reporting structure under two reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions. U.S. Healthcare Solutions consists of the legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment (excluding Profarma Distribuidora de Produtos Farmac&#234;uticos S.A.(\"Profarma\")), MWI Animal Health (\"MWI\"), Xcenda, Lash Group, and ICS 3PL. International Healthcare Solutions consists of Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, Innomar, Profarma, and Profarma Specialty (until it was divested in June 2022). Profarma had previously been included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment. Our previously reported segment results have been revised to conform to our re-aligned reporting structure. \n\nU.S. Healthcare Solutions Segment \n\nThe U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. It also provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that ranges from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. Additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. Through its animal health business, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. It also offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers. \n\nInternational Healthcare Solutions Segment \n\nThe International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment consists of businesses that focus on international pharmaceutical wholesale and related service operations and global commercialization services. The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes pharmaceuticals, other healthcare products, and related services to healthcare providers, including pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals primarily in Europe. It also is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. In Canada, the business drives innovative partnerships with manufacturers, providers, and pharmacies to improve product access and efficiency throughout the healthcare supply chain. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRecent Development \n\nPharmaLex Acquisition \n\nIn September 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire PharmaLex Holding GmbH (\"PharmaLex\"), a leading provider of specialized services for the life sciences industry, for &#8364;1.28 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments. PharmaLex's services include regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance, and quality management and compliance. The acquisition will advance our role as a partner of choice for biopharmaceutical manufacturers by enhancing our global portfolio of solutions to support manufacturer partners across the pharmaceutical development and commercialization journey. PharmaLex will be a component of our International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment. The acquisition is expected to close by March 2023 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. \n\nExecutive Summary \n\nThis executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follow: \n\n&#8226; Revenue increased by $24.6 billion, or 11.5%, from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to our June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and revenue growth in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Revenue in International Healthcare Solutions increased by $15.0 billion, or 129.8%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment grew its revenue $9.6 billion, or 4.8%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to overall market growth principally driven by unit volume growth and increased sales to specialty physician practices, offset in part by a decline in sales of COVID-19 treatments (primarily commercial treatments); \n\n&#8226; Total gross profit increased by $1,353.1 million, or 19.5%, from the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in International Healthcare Solutions of $1,404.7 million, or 91.1%, and U.S. Healthcare Solutions of $425.8 million, or 8.5%, from the prior fiscal year. Gross profit in International Healthcare Solutions increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. U.S. Healthcare Solutions' gross profit increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to overall revenue growth and fees earned relating to the distribution of government-owned COVID-19 treatments. These increases were offset in part by last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") expense in comparison to a LIFO credit in the prior year, decreases in gains from antitrust litigation settlements, and the Turkey highly inflationary economy's unfavorable impact on the current fiscal year; \n\n&#8226; Total operating expenses increased by $1,341.0 million, or 29.2%, from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of increases in distribution, selling, and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, as well as a $75.9 million goodwill impairment of our Profarma reporting unit, offset in part by lower expense accruals related to opioid litigation settlements in the current fiscal year; \n\n&#8226; Total segment operating income increased by $515.2 million, or 19.5%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and 8.8% operating income growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment; and \n\n&#8226; Our effective tax rates were 23.7% and 30.5% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to U.S. state income taxes, offset in part by the benefit of non-U.S. income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was higher than the current year tax rate primarily due to UK and Swiss tax reforms (see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nTable of Contents \n\nResults of Operations \n\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 \n\nRevenue \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change U.S. Healthcare Solutions Human Health 207,284,444 197,777,128 4.8% Animal Health 4,815,758 4,684,417 2.8% Total U.S. Healthcare Solutions 212,100,202 202,461,545 4.8% International Healthcare Solutions Alliance Healthcare 21,890,402 7,373,365 196.9% Other Healthcare Solutions 4,601,271 4,156,264 10.7% Total International Solutions 26,491,673 11,529,629 129.8% Intersegment eliminations (4,869) (2,331) Revenue $ 238,587,006 $ 213,988,843 11.5% ##TABLE_END\n\nOur future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new, innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs and biosimilars that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs and biosimilars, price inflation and price deflation, general economic conditions in the United States and Europe, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third-party reimbursement rates to our customers, changes in government rules and regulations, foreign currency conversion rates, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nRevenue increased by 11.5% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to our June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the revenue growth of our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. \n\nThe U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment grew its revenue by $9.6 billion, or 4.8%, from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to overall market growth principally driven by unit volume growth and increased sales to specialty physician practices, offset in part by a decline in sales of COVID-19 treatments (primarily commercial treatments). \n\nMore specifically, the increase in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was largely attributable to the following (in billions): \n\n##TABLE_START Increased sales to specialty physician practices $2.9 Decreased sales of COVID-19 treatments ($2.0) Increased sales to other customers $8.7 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe continued decline of sales relating to COVID-19 treatments and fees earned from the distribution of government-owned COVID-19 treatments could adversely impact our results of operations. \n\nRevenue in International Healthcare Solutions increased by $15.0 billion, or 129.8%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. \n\nA number of our contracts with customers, including group purchasing organizations, are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a significant customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, no significant contracts expired. In January 2022, we extended our agreement with Express Scripts through September 2026. Over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. If those contracts are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nGross Profit \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change U.S. Healthcare Solutions $ 5,454,735 $ 5,028,950 8.5% International Healthcare Solutions 2,947,190 1,542,456 91.1% Intersegment eliminations (189) &#8212; Gains from antitrust litigation settlements 1,835 168,794 &#160; LIFO (expense) credit (67,171) 203,028 &#160; Turkey highly inflationary impact (40,033) &#8212; Gross profit $ 8,296,367 $ 6,943,228 19.5% ##TABLE_END\n\nGross profit increased by $1,353.1 million, or 19.5%, from the prior fiscal year. Gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in International Healthcare Solutions and U.S. Healthcare Solutions.

As a percentage of revenue, U.S. Healthcare Solutions gross profit margin of 2.57% in the current fiscal year increased 9 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to fees earned from the distribution of government-owned COVID-19 treatments. \n\nGross profit in International Healthcare Solutions increased $1,404.7 million, or 91.1%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. \n\nWe recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $1.8 million and $168.8 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gains were recorded as reductions to Cost of Goods Sold (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nOur cost of goods sold includes a LIFO provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision. The LIFO expense in the current fiscal year was primarily due to lower generic pharmaceutical deflation and inventory product mix. \n\nWe recognized an expense of $40.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 in Cost of Goods Sold related to the impact of Turkey highly inflationary accounting (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Distribution, selling, and administrative $ 4,848,962 $ 3,594,251 34.9% Depreciation and amortization 693,895 505,172 37.4% Litigation and opioid-related expenses 123,191 272,623 &#160; Acquisition, integration, and restructuring expenses 183,059 199,288 Goodwill impairment 75,936 6,373 Impairment of assets 4,946 11,324 Total operating expenses $ 5,929,989 $ 4,589,031 29.2% ##TABLE_END\n\nDistribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased by $1,254.7 million, or 34.9%, from the prior fiscal year.

As a percentage of revenue, U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income margin was 1.16% and represented an increase of 4 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase from the prior year fiscal year was primarily due to fees earned from the distribution of government-owned COVID-19 treatments. \n\nOperating income in International Healthcare Solutions increased by $316.2 million, or 81.0%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. \n\nOther Income, Net \n\nWe recognized a gain of $56.2 million from the sale of non-core businesses, a $14.4 million foreign currency loss on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets relating to Swiss tax reform, an $11.9 million expense related to the impact of Turkey highly inflationary accounting, and a $4.8 million gain on the remeasurement of an equity investment in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. \n\nWe recorded a $64.7 million gain on the remeasurement of an equity investment, a $14.0 million impairment of a non-customer note receivable related to a start-up venture, and a $3.4 million foreign currency loss on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets relating to Swiss tax reform in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nInterest Expense, Net \n\nInterest expense, net and the respective weighted average interest rates were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended September 30, &#160; 2022 2021 (dollars in thousands) Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Interest expense $ 231,982 2.69% $ 182,544 2.62% Interest income (21,309) 1.08% (8,470) 0.28% Interest expense, net $ 210,673 &#160; $ 174,074 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest expense, net increased $36.6 million, or 21.0%, from the prior fiscal year due to the issuance of our $1,525 million of 0.737% senior notes, $1,000 million of 2.700% senior notes in March 2021, and the $500 million variable-rate term loan that was issued in June 2021, all of which were used to finance a portion of the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, and the incremental interest expense associated with Alliance Healthcare's debt in certain countries, offset in part by the increase in interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher investment interest rates, offset in part by lower average invested cash balances. The increase in interest expense as a result of the above-mentioned debt issuances was offset in part by repayments of $250 million in September 2021 and again in March 2022 on the above-mentioned $500 million variable-rate term loan, and payments of $500 million in June 2022 and $350 million in September 2022 on the above-mentioned $1,525 million of 0.737% senior notes. \n\nOur interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings, interest rates, amendments to our current borrowing facilities, and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nOur effective tax rates were 23.7% and 30.5% in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate due to our operating loss, the tax benefits associated with our decision to permanently exit the PharMEDium compounding business, Swiss Tax Reform, the CARES Act, and other discrete items and offset in part by the tax impact of the portion of the opioid legal accrual that is not expected to be tax deductible. \n\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Diluted Earnings Per Share \n\nNet income attributable to AmerisourceBergen and diluted earnings per share were significantly lower in fiscal 2020 due to the legal accrual recognized in connection with opioid lawsuits. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nCritical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. For a complete list of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAllowances for Returns and Credit Losses \n\nTrade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for credit losses. Our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. We record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends. The allowance for returns as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $1,532.1 million and $1,271.6 million, respectively. \n\nWe evaluate our receivables for risk of loss by grouping our receivables with similar risk characteristics. Expected losses are determined based on a combination of historical loss trends, current economic conditions, and forward-looking risk factors. Changes in these factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for credit losses. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by management as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. Each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains reserves for expected credit losses and specific credit problems when they arise. We write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. Each business unit performs formal, documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly, and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for credit losses, net of write-offs, recoveries, and other adjustments. \n\nBad debt expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $26.1 million, $12.1 million, and $11.9 million respectively. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2022 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $18.5 million. The allowance for credit losses was $94.7 million and $85.1 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nSchedule II of this Form 10-K sets forth a rollforward of allowances for returns and credit losses. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. We identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure, beginning with our operating segments. We aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics, which include the similarity of long-term gross margins, the nature of the components' products, services, and production processes, the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers, and the components' regulatory environment. We announced a strategic reorganization of our business and began reporting externally under the new structure as of October 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, our reporting units include Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, U.S. Consulting Services, MWI, Alliance Healthcare, Innomar, World Courier, and Profarma. \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of these impairment tests, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Such qualitative factors can include, among others, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude based on its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, it performs a quantitative analysis. We elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2022. We elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2021, with the exception of our testing of goodwill in the AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (the sum of U.S. Consulting Services and Innomar reporting units, under our prior reporting structure) and Profarma reporting units. We elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2020, with the exception of our testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in the MWI and Profarma reporting units. \n\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \n\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment assessment, we utilize an income-based approach to value our reporting units, with the exception of the Profarma reporting unit, the fair value of which is based upon its publicly-traded stock price, plus an estimated control premium. The income-based approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. We generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-range plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. While we use the best available information to prepare our forecasted cash flows and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. \n\nThe quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of \n\nTable of Contents \n\nthe impairment testing date. We estimate the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. We believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use. \n\nWe completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. We recorded goodwill impairments of $75.9 million and $6.4 million in our Profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2022 and 2021 impairment tests, respectively (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). No goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, and no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We perform a recoverability assessment of our long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present. \n\nWe recorded impairments of intangible and tangible assets totaling $361.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 in connection with the permanent shutdown of our compounding business. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect management's assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. \n\nWe have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above. \n\nWe prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. Significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position. \n\nWe believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. However, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. \n\nThe significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $21.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. \n\nFor a complete discussion of the tax impact of UK Tax Reform, Swiss Tax Reform, the legal accrual related to opioid litigation, the CARES Act, and the PharMEDium worthless stock deduction, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 66% of our inventories as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 has been determined using the LIFO method. If we had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $1,383.4 million and $1,316.2 million higher than the amounts reported as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recorded LIFO expense of $67.2 million and $7.4 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2020, respectively. We recorded a LIFO credit of $203.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The annual LIFO provision is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory \n\nTable of Contents \n\nquantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision. \n\nLoss Contingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we become involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, stockholder demands, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. Significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. We record a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency and whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can made in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Among the loss contingencies we considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nOur operating results have generated cash flows, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and purchases of shares of our common stock. \n\nOur primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund the payment of dividends, fund purchases of our common stock, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including the opioid litigation payments that will be made over 18 years (see below). \n\nCash Flows \n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $688.4 million and $725.4 million, respectively. We have the ability to repatriate the majority of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring significant additional taxes upon repatriation. \n\nWe have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the December and March quarters that, depending on our cash balance, may require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. Our cash balances in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs. The largest amount of intra-period borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $590.0 million and $637.7 million, respectively. We had $4,435.9 million, $4,730.5 million, and $117.4 million of cumulative intra-period borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, our operating activities provided cash of $2,703.1 million and $2,666.6 million, respectively. Cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was principally the result of the following: \n\n&#8226; An increase in accounts payable of $3,320.7 million primarily due to the increase in our inventory balances and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers; \n\n&#8226; Net income of $1,666.5 million; \n\n&#8226; Positive non-cash items of $1,176.2 million, which is primarily comprised of depreciation expense of $390.6 million, amortization expense of $319.2 million, and the provision for deferred income taxes of $196.2 million, offset in part by: \n\n&#9702; An increase in accounts receivable of $1,659.5 million primarily due to an increase in sales and the timing of scheduled payments from our customers; \n\n&#9702; An increase in inventories of $665.4 million to support the increase in business volume; \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#9702; A decrease in long-term accrued litigation liability of $500.2 million due to opioid litigation settlement payments; \n\n&#9702; A decrease in accrued expenses of $457.2 million; and \n\n&#9702; A decrease in income taxes payable and other liabilities of $330.1 million. \n\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, our operating activities provided cash of $2,666.6 million and $2,207.0 million, respectively. Cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was principally the result of the following: \n\n&#8226; An increase in accounts payable of $2,049.2 million primarily driven by the increase in inventories and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers; \n\n&#8226; Net income of $1,544.6 million; \n\n&#8226; Net positive non-cash items totaling $754.7 million, which is primarily comprised of the provision for deferred income taxes of $334.9 million, depreciation expense of $326.7 million, amortization expense of $188.1 million, and a LIFO credit of $203.0 million, offset in part by: \n\n&#9702; An increase in inventories of $1,116.3 million to support the increase in business volume; and \n\n&#9702; An increase in accounts receivable of $930.1 million primarily due to our revenue growth and the timing of payments from our customers. \n\nWe use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The below financial metrics are calculated based upon a quarterly average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Days sales outstanding 27.7 26.2 24.7 Days inventory on hand 28.3 28.6 28.7 Days payable outstanding 60.0 58.3 57.6 ##TABLE_END\n\nOur cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period-end working capital account balances. Additionally, any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations. The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare increased our days sales outstanding and days payable outstanding as it has longer payment terms with customers and manufacturers. Operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 included $219.8 million of interest payments and $244.4 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 included $170.9 million of interest payments and $93.5 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 included $150.7 million of interest payments and $139.4 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. \n\nCapital expenditures in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $496.3 million, $438.2 million, and $369.7 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 included investments in various technology initiatives, including technology initiatives at Alliance Healthcare. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 and 2020 included costs associated with facility expansions, and various technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our primary information technology operating systems. \n\nWe currently expect to spend approximately $500 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2023. Larger 2023 capital expenditures will include investments relating to various technology initiatives, including technology investments at Alliance Healthcare and those required to comply with new regulatory requirements. \n\nIn addition to capital expenditures, net cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 included $133.8 million of cash to acquire companies, including $60.0 million that was paid to settle accrued consideration related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and was offset in part by $272.6 million in proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses. \n\nIn addition to capital expenditures, net cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended 2021 included $5,563.0 million of cash to acquire companies, which principally related to the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, net of cash acquired, and $162.6 million for equity investments. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 principally resulted from an $850 million repayment of our 0.737% senior notes that mature in 2023, the repayment of our $250 million term loan, $391.7 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock, and $483.7 million in purchases of our common stock. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 principally resulted from the issuance of senior notes and the February 2021 Term Loan (see above) and $198.8 million of exercises of stock options, offset in part by $650 million of repayments of our term loans, $366.6 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock, and $82.2 million in purchases of our common stock. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 principally related to $420.4 million in purchases of our common stock and $343.6 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock. \n\nDebt and Credit Facility Availability \n\nThe following illustrates our debt structure as of September 30, 2022, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility, the revolving credit note, the money market facility, Alliance Healthcare debt, and the overdraft facility: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) Outstanding Balance Additional Availability Fixed-Rate Debt: &#160; &#160; 0.737% senior notes due 2023 $ 672,736 $ &#8212; $500,000, 3.400% senior notes due 2024 499,195 &#8212; $500,000, 3.250% senior notes due 2025 498,347 &#8212; $750,000, 3.450% senior notes due 2027 745,622 &#8212; $500,000, 2.800% senior notes due 2030 495,348 &#8212; $1,000,000, 2.700% senior notes due 2031 990,480 &#8212; $500,000, 4.250% senior notes due 2045 495,162 &#8212; $500,000, 4.300% senior notes due 2047 493,288 &#8212; Nonrecourse debt 66,539 &#8212; Total fixed-rate debt 4,956,717 &#8212; Variable-Rate Debt: &#160; &#160; Revolving credit note &#8212; 75,000 Money market facility &#8212; 100,000 Receivables securitization facility due 2025 350,000 1,100,000 Overdraft facility due 2024 (&#163;10,000) &#8212; 11,169 Multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2027 &#8212; 2,400,000 Alliance Healthcare debt 336,886 109,624 Nonrecourse debt 59,230 &#8212; Total variable-rate debt 746,116 3,795,793 Total debt $ 5,702,833 $ 3,795,793 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn May 2020, we issued $500 million of 2.80% senior notes due May 15, 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\"). The 2030 Notes were sold at 99.71% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 2.81%. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears and commenced on November 15, 2020. \n\nWe used the proceeds from the 2030 Notes to finance the early retirement of the $500 million of 3.50% senior notes that were due in 2021 and made a $21.4 million prepayment premium in connection with this early retirement. \n\nIn March 2021, we issued $1,525 million of 0.737% senior notes due March 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\"). The 2023 Notes were sold at 100.00% of the principal amount. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on September 15, 2021. In March 2021, we issued $1,000 million of 2.700% senior notes due March 15, 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\"). The 2031 Notes were sold at 99.79% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 2.706%. Interest on the 2031 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears and commenced on September 15, 2021. The 2023 Notes and 2031 Notes rank pari passu to our other senior notes, the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Note, the Overdraft Facility, and the Money Market Facility. We used the proceeds from the 2023 Notes and 2031 Notes to finance a portion of the June 2021 Alliance Healthcare acquisition. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, we elected to repay $850 million of the 2023 Notes due in March 2023. \n\nIn addition to the 2023 Notes, the 2030 Notes, and the 2031 Notes, we have $500 million of 3.40% senior notes due May 15, 2024, $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due March 1, 2025, $750 million of 3.45% senior notes due December 15, 2027, $500 million of 4.25% senior notes due March 1, 2045, and $500 million of 4.300% senior notes due December 15, 2047 (collectively, the \"Notes\"). Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe have a $2.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility (\"Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility\"), which was scheduled to expire in November 2026, with a syndicate of lenders. In October 2022, we amended and restated the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility to extend the expiration to October 2027 and to make changes to effect a transition from the LIBOR interest rate benchmark to Term SOFR. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based upon our debt rating and ranges from 80.5 basis points to 122.5 basis points over SOFR/EURIBOR/CDOR/RFR, as applicable (101.5 basis points over CDOR/LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee as of September 30, 2022) and from 0 basis points to 22.5 basis points over the alternate base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based upon our debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 15 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (11 basis points as of September 30, 2022). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which we were compliant as of September 30, 2022. \n\nWe have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $2.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. \n\nWe have a $1,450 million receivables securitization facility (\"Receivables Securitization Facility\"), which was scheduled to expire in November 2024. In October 2022, we amended the Receivables Securitization Facility (\"Receivables Amendment\") to extend the expiration for an additional one year until October 2025. In addition, the Receivables Amendment made changes to (i) substitute Term SOFR for LIBOR as a benchmark and establish procedures to choose a new benchmark if Term SOFR becomes unavailable, (ii) provide for the return of erroneous payments, if any, by purchasers, (iii) update provisions regarding compliance with sanctions and anti-money laundering laws, and (iv) implement certain other technical amendments. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based upon prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or 30-day Term SOFR plus a program fee. We pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. \n\nIn connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation and a specialty distribution subsidiary sell on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. As sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. We use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. We securitize our trade accounts, which are generally non-interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which we were compliant as of September 30, 2022. \n\nWe have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note (\"Revolving Credit Note\"). The Revolving Credit Note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. We also have a &#163;10 million uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility (\"Overdraft Facility\"), which expires in February 2024, to fund short-term normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our MWI Animal Health business. We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a money market credit agreement (\"Money Market Facility\"). The Money Market Facility provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $100 million. The Money Market Facility may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. \n\nOur $400 million Term Loan matured and was repaid in October 2020. \n\nIn February 2021, we entered into a $1.0 billion variable-rate term loan (&#8220;February 2021 Term Loan&#8221;), which was available to be drawn on the closing date of the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. In April 2021, we reduced our commitment under the February 2021 Term Loan to $500 million. In June 2021, we borrowed $500 million under the February 2021 Term Loan to finance a portion of the June 2021 Alliance Healthcare acquisition. We elected to make principal payments of $250 million in September 2021 and again in March 2022 to repay the loan that was scheduled to mature in 2023. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAlliance Healthcare debt is comprised of uncommitted revolving credit facilities in various currencies with various rates. A majority of the outstanding borrowings were held in Egypt (which is 50% owned) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. These facilities are used to fund its working capital needs. \n\nNonrecourse debt is comprised of short-term and long-term debt belonging to the Brazil subsidiaries and is repaid solely from the Brazil subsidiaries' cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the Brazil subsidiaries. \n\nShare Purchase Programs and Dividends \n\nIn October 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we purchased $538.9 million of our common stock under this program, which included $14.8 million of September 2019 purchases that cash settled in October 2019. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we purchased $405.6 million of our common stock, which excluded $14.8 million of September 2019 purchases that cash settled in October 2019. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we purchased $55.5 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this program. \n\nIn May 2020, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we purchased $26.6 million of our common stock. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we purchased $473.4 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this program. \n\nIn May 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program allowing the Company to purchase up to $1.0 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we purchased $38.7 million of our common stock, which included $28.4 million of September 2022 purchases that cash settled in October 2022. As of September 30, 2022, we had $961.3 million of availability remaining under this program. In October 2022, under this program, we purchased 0.6 million shares of our common stock for $78.8 million. In November 2022, under this program, we purchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock from WBA for $500.0 million. \n\nOur board of directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases: \n\n##TABLE_START Dividend Increases &#160; Per Share &#160; Date New Rate Old Rate % Increase January 2020 $0.420 $0.400 5% November 2020 $0.440 $0.420 5% November 2021 $0.460 $0.440 5% November 2022 $0.485 $0.460 5% ##TABLE_END\n\nWe anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. \n\nCommitments and Obligations \n\nAs discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 21, 2021, it was announced that we and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a comprehensive opioid settlement agreement. The comprehensive settlement agreement became effective on April 2, 2022, and as of September 30, 2022, it included 48 of 49 eligible states (the &#8220;Settling States&#8221;) as well as 99% by population of the eligible political subdivisions in the Settling States. Pursuant to the comprehensive settlement agreement and related agreements with Settling States, we will pay up to approximately $6.4 billion over 18 years. Our estimated liability related to the State of Alabama (with whom we have not reached a settlement agreement), as well as other opioid-related litigation for which we have reached settlement agreements is approximately $0.4 billion. Net of $0.8 billion of payments made through September 30, 2022, we have a $6.0 billion liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 for litigation relating to our comprehensive opioid settlement as well as other opioid-related litigation. The payment of the aforementioned litigation liability has not and is not expected to have an impact on our ability to pay dividends. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancellable operating leases, and minimum payments on our other commitments as of September 30, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Debt, Including Interest Payments Operating Leases Other Commitments Total Within 1 year $ 1,245,995 $ 192,031 $ 123,771 $ 1,561,797 1-3 years 1,688,379 333,213 137,111 2,158,703 4-5 years 235,886 257,090 57,788 550,764 After 5 years 4,215,090 456,276 &#8212; 4,671,366 Total $ 7,385,350 $ 1,238,610 $ 318,670 $ 8,942,630 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe 2017 Tax Act required a one-time transition tax to be recognized on historical foreign earnings and profits. We expect to pay $157.1 million, net of overpayments and tax credits, related to this transition tax, as of September 30, 2022, which is payable in installments over a six-year period that commenced in January 2021. The transition tax commitment is included in \"Other Commitments\" in the above table. \n\nOur liability for uncertain tax positions was $553.2 million (including interest and penalties) as of September 30, 2022. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. Our liability for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2022 primarily includes an uncertain tax benefit related to the $6.8 billion legal accrual for litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications, as disclosed in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nMarket Risk \n\nWe have exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the U.K. Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Turkish Lira, the Egyptian Pound, the Brazilian Real, and the Canadian Dollar. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Turkey became a highly inflationary economy, as defined under U.S. GAAP (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Also, with the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, our foreign currency and exchange rate risk increased; therefore, we now use forward contracts to hedge against the foreign currency exchange rate impact on certain intercompany receivable and payable balances. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. Revenue from our foreign operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue. \n\nWe have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We had $746.1 million of variable-rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2022. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and/or on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect as of September 30, 2022. \n\nWe also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $3,388.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10-basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million. \n\nDeterioration of general economic conditions, among other factors, could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations. \n\nRecent elevated levels of inflation in the global and U.S. economies have not had a significant impact on our results of operations. If elevated levels of inflation persist or increase, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected, particularly in certain global markets. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe have risks from other geopolitical trends and events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war. Although the long-term implications of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in fiscal 2022 has not been material. \n\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 22, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLegal Matters and Contingencies - Opioid Lawsuits \n\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in a significant number of lawsuits with counties, municipalities, and other governmental entities in a majority of U.S. states and Puerto Rico, as well as numerous states and tribes relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications (&#8220;opioid litigation&#8221;). The Company recognizes a liability for those legal contingencies for which it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount is reasonably estimable. The Company has recognized a $6.0 billion liability related to the opioid litigation as of September 30, 2022 and has disclosed that it is unable to estimate the range of possible loss in excess of the amount accrued. In connection with this liability, the Company recognized a related income tax benefit, which reflects an unrecognized tax benefit resulting from uncertainty in the amount that is more likely than not to be deductible for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The Company used significant judgment in measuring the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be deductible for U.S. federal and state purposes. ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START Auditing management&#8217;s determination of the measurement of the opioid litigation liability and disclosures is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. For instance, auditing management&#8217;s judgments related to the opioid litigation is challenging due to the significant judgment applied in determining the magnitude of the liability and whether a range of possible loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably estimable, based upon the proposed or final settlement agreements. In addition, auditing management's estimate of the amount of income tax benefit related to the Company's uncertain tax position is challenging because the evaluation of the technical merits of income tax benefits that qualify for a deduction related to the opioid litigation requires significant judgment. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested the Company&#8217;s internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement related to the completeness, presentation and disclosure of the opioid litigation liability and related uncertain tax position. This included testing controls related to the Company&#8217;s process for identification, recognition, completeness and disclosure of the opioid litigation and testing controls related to the Company&#8217;s process to assess the technical merits of its tax position, including the Company&#8217;s assessment as to the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities. For example, we tested controls over management&#8217;s review of the assessment of the completeness of the opioid litigation liability and whether a range of possible loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably estimable to determine the accuracy of the opioid litigation liability and the related financial statement footnote disclosures. To test the Company&#8217;s opioid litigation liability, our substantive audit procedures included, among others, testing the measurement of the opioid litigation contingencies by inspecting the proposed or final settlement agreements and agreeing key terms to management&#8217;s reserve calculation and assumptions, as well as vouching payments made during the year. We inspected responses to inquiry letters sent to both internal and external legal counsel, held discussions with internal general counsel and external legal counsel to confirm our understanding of any settlement discussions, and obtained written representations from executives of the Company. In addition, we evaluated the adequacy of the Company&#8217;s financial statement disclosures. We involved our tax subject matter professionals in assessing the technical merits and measurement of the Company&#8217;s tax position related to the opioid litigation liability. We examined the Company&#8217;s analysis and evaluated the underlying facts upon which the tax position was based. We used our knowledge of historical settlement activity to evaluate the Company&#8217;s measurement of the uncertain tax position associated with the opioid litigation. This included evaluating third-party evidence obtained from the Company&#8217;s external income tax advisors. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company&#8217;s financial statement disclosures and obtained written representations from executives of the Company related to this income tax matter. ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START Other Legal Matters and Contingencies Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements, in addition to the opioid litigation addressed above, the Company is involved in government subpoenas, derivative actions, and other disputes. The Company recognizes a liability for those legal contingencies for which it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount is reasonably estimable. The Company also performs an assessment of the materiality of legal contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. If it is reasonably possible that such a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred and the effect on the consolidated financial statements is material, the Company discloses the nature of the loss contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Auditing management&#8217;s determination of whether a loss for a legal contingency is probable and reasonably estimable, reasonably possible or remote, and the related measurement and disclosures, is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. For instance, auditing management&#8217;s judgments was challenging due to the significant judgment applied in determining the likelihood of resolution of the matters through settlement or litigation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested the Company&#8217;s internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement related to the completeness, valuation, presentation and disclosure of legal contingencies. This included testing controls related to the Company&#8217;s process for identification, recognition, measurement and disclosure of legal contingencies. For example, we tested controls over management&#8217;s review of the assessment of the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable to determine the completeness and accuracy of legal contingencies and the related financial statement footnote disclosures. We also tested controls over management&#8217;s assessment of the likelihood of the resolution of the matters through settlement or litigation. To test the Company&#8217;s legal contingencies, our substantive audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness of the legal contingencies subject to evaluation by the Company and evaluating the Company&#8217;s analysis of its assessment of the probability of outcome for each material legal contingency, including the Company&#8217;s assessment as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable or if the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss, through inspection of responses to inquiry letters sent to both internal and external legal counsel, discussions with internal general counsel and external legal counsel to confirm our understanding of the allegations, and obtaining written representations from executives of the Company. In addition, we evaluated the adequacy of the Company&#8217;s financial statement disclosures. ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160;/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\n&#160;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nAmerisourceBergen Corporation and its subsidiaries, including less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in which AmerisourceBergen Corporation has a controlling financial interest (the \"Company\"), is one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. The Company delivers innovative programs and services designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. \n\nThe Company undertook a strategic evaluation of its reporting structure to reflect its expanded international presence as a result of the June 2021 acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. As a result, at the beginning of fiscal 2022, the Company re-aligned its reporting structure under two reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions. U.S. Healthcare Solutions consists of the legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment (excluding Profarma Distribuidora de Produtos Farmac&#234;uticos S.A. (\"Profarma\")), MWI Animal Health (\"MWI\"), Xcenda, Lash Group, and ICS 3PL. International Healthcare Solutions consists of Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, Innomar, Profarma, and Profarma Specialty (until it was divested in June 2022). Profarma had previously been included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment. The Company&#8217;s prior period segment disclosures have been revised to reflect this change in reportable segments. \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nThe accompanying financial statements present the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as of the dates and for the periods indicated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from these estimated amounts due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements for continued reasonableness . \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (\"ASU 2016-13\"). ASU 2016-13 requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amounts. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. ASU 2016-13 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and a modified retrospective approach was required, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance was effective. \n\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of October 1, 2020. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company recognized a $ 21.1 million, net of tax of $ 6.1 million, cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. \n\nFor the Company's credit loss policy, refer to the \"Concentrations of Credit Risk and Allowance for Credit Losses\" section of Note 1. \n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\" (\"ASU 2019-12\"). ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 740 in order to reduce the cost and complexity of its application. ASU 2019-12 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with certain amendments applied on a modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, and others prospectively. \n\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2019-12 as of October 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU No. 2019-12 had no impact on the Company's financial statements. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, there were no recently issued accounting standards that may have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows upon their adoption. \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed from an acquired business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of an acquired businesses are included in the Company's operating results from the date of acquisition. \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash \n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value. \n\nThe Company is required to maintain certain cash deposits with banks mainly consisting of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations, including opioid-related legal settlements. \n\nThe following represents a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: \n\n##TABLE_START September 30, (amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,388,189 &#160; $ 2,547,142 &#160; $ 4,597,746 &#160; Restricted cash (included in Prepaid Expenses and Other) 144,980 &#160; 462,986 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restricted cash (included in Other Assets) 60,370 &#160; 60,000 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 3,593,539 &#160; $ 3,070,128 &#160; $ 4,597,746 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Allowance for Credit Losses \n\n&#160; The Company sells its inventories to a large number of customers in the healthcare industry that include institutional and retail healthcare providers. Institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals, health systems, mail order pharmacies, long-term care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities, and physician offices. Retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains, independent community pharmacies, pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers, and veterinarians. The financial condition of the Company's customers can be affected by changes in government reimbursement policies as well as by other economic pressures in the healthcare industry. \n\nThe Company's trade accounts receivables are exposed to credit risk. Revenue from the various agreements and arrangements with the Company's largest customer in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (\"WBA\"), accounted for approximately 27 % of revenue and represented approximately 38 % of accounts receivable, net of incentives, as of September 30, 2022. Express Scripts, Inc., the Company's second largest customer in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, accounted for approximately 13 % of revenue and represented approximately 7 % of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2022. The Company generally does not require collateral for trade receivables. The Company evaluates its receivables for risk of loss by grouping its receivables with similar risk characteristics. Expected losses are determined based on a combination of historical loss trends, current economic conditions, and forward-looking risk factors. Changes in these factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in the Company's allowance for credit losses. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by Company management as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables. Each of the Company's business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains reserves for expected credit losses for specific credit problems when they arise. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. \n\nThe Company maintains cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. The Company seeks to mitigate such risks by monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties. The Company also seeks to mitigate risk by monitoring the investment strategy of money market accounts in which it is invested, which are classified as cash equivalents. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nContingencies \n\nLoss Contingencies: In the ordinary course of its business, the Company becomes involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, stockholder demands, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. Significant damages or penalties may be sought from the Company in some matters, and some matters may require years for the Company to resolve. The Company records a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company also performs an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, the Company provides disclosure of the loss contingency in the notes to its financial statements. The Company reviews all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Among the loss contingencies that the Company considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in Note 13 . \n\nGain Contingencies: The Company records gain contingencies when they are realized. Gains from antitrust litigation settlements are realized upon the receipt of cash and recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold because they represent a recovery of amounts historically paid to manufacturers to originally acquire the pharmaceuticals that were the subject of the antitrust litigation settlements (see Note 14). \n\nDerivative Financial Instruments \n\nThe Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency. The Company records all derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value and complies with established criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships. The Company's policy prohibits it from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. \n\nForeign Currency \n\nWhen the functional currency of the Company's foreign operations is the applicable local currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. The resulting asset and liability translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss within Stockholders' Equity. \n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Turkey became a highly inflationary economy, as defined under U.S. GAAP. As a result, effective April 1, 2022, and until such time as the applicable economy is no longer considered highly inflationary, Turkish Lira-denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured using the Company's reporting currency in accordance with ASC 830, \"Foreign Currency Matters.\" Turkish Lira denominated monetary assets and liabilities (primarily cash, accounts receivables, and accounts payables) are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the currency exchange rate then in effect, with currency remeasurement gains and losses recognized in Other Income in the Statement of Operations. Turkish Lira-denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities (primarily inventories, goodwill, and other intangible assets) are translated at the currency exchange rate in effect prior to highly inflation accounting commencement or at the exchange rate in effect at their date of acquisition if subsequent to April 1, 2022. As such, nonmonetary assets and liabilities retain a higher historical basis when currencies are devalued. This higher historical basis results in incremental expense being recognized when nonmonetary assets are consumed (i.e., sale of inventory). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded an incremental expense of $ 40.0 million in Cost of Goods Sold related to the consumption of inventory and an expense of $ 11.9 million within Other Income related to the currency remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. The Company identifies its reporting units based upon the Company's management reporting structure, beginning with its operating segments. The Company aggregates two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. The Company evaluates whether the components within its operating segments have similar economic characteristics, which include the similarity of long-term gross margins, the nature of the components' products, services, and production processes, the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers, and the components' regulatory environment. The Company announced a strategic reorganization of its business and began reporting externally under the new structure as of October 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, the Company&#8217;s reporting units include Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, U.S. Consulting Services, MWI, Alliance Healthcare, Innomar, World Courier, and Profarma. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of these impairment tests, the Company can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Such qualitative factors can include, among others, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. If the Company concludes based on its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, it performs a quantitative analysis. The Company elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2022. The Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2021, with the exception of its testing of goodwill in the AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (the sum of U.S. Consulting Service and Innomar reporting units, under the Company&#8217;s prior reporting structure) and Profarma reporting units. The Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2020, with the exception of its testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in the MWI and Profarma reporting units. \n\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test requires the Company to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \n\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment assessment, the Company utilizes an income-based approach to value its reporting units, with the exception of the Profarma reporting unit, the fair value of which is based upon its publicly-traded stock price, plus an estimated control premium. The income-based approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company generally believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the Company's reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Company's long-range plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its forecasted cash flows and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Company's overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. \n\nThe quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use. \n\nThe Company completed its required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The Company recorded goodwill impairments of $ 75.9 million and $ 6.4 million in its Profarma reporting unit in connection with its fiscal 2022 and 2021 impairment tests (see Note 5), respectively. No goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, and no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company performs a recoverability assessment of its long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present. \n\nThe Company recorded impairments of intangible and tangible assets totaling $ 361.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 in connection with the permanent shutdown of its compounding business. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nHeld for Sale \n\nAssets and liabilities to be disposed of by sale (\"disposal groups\") are reclassified into assets and liabilities held for sale on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The reclassification occurs when an agreement to sell exists, or management has committed to a plan to sell the assets within one year. Disposal groups are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortized. When the net realizable value of a disposal group increases during a period, a gain can be recognized to the extent that it does not increase the value of the disposal group beyond its original carrying value when the disposal group was reclassified as held for sale. The fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using a method that requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of the Company's assets and liabilities (commonly known as the asset and liability method). In assessing the need to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including settlements with tax authorities or resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position. Tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions that have met the recognition criteria are measured and recorded based upon the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 66 % of the Company's inventories as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 has been determined using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method. If the Company had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $ 1,383.4 million and $ 1,316.2 million higher than the amounts reported as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded LIFO expense of $ 67.2 million and $ 7.4 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2020, respectively, and a LIFO credit of $ 203.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The annual LIFO provision is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to the Company's annual LIFO provision. \n\nInvestments \n\nThe Company first evaluates its investments in accordance with the variable interest model to determine whether it has a controlling financial interest in an investment. This evaluation is made as of the date on which the Company makes its initial investment, and subsequent evaluations are made if the structure of the investment changes. If it has determined that an investment is a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"), the Company evaluates whether the VIE is required to be consolidated. When the Company holds rights that give it the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, combined with the obligation to absorb an entity's losses and the right to receive benefits, the Company consolidates a VIE. If it is determined that an investment is not a VIE, the Company then evaluates its investments under the voting interest model and generally consolidates investments in which it holds an ownership interest of greater than 50%. When the Company consolidates less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries, it presents its noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160; For equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, the Company uses the fair value measurement alternative and measures the securities at cost less impairment, if any, including adjustments for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in which the Company can exercise significant influence but does not control, it uses the equity method of accounting. The Company's share of earnings and losses of its investments is recorded in Other Income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company monitors its investments for impairment by considering factors such as the operating performance of the investment and current economic and market conditions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nLeases \n\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the facts and circumstances present. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. At the lease commencement date, operating and finance lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and, as such, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease liabilities, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The Company does not recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less. \n\nThe Company has operating leases that are primarily comprised of buildings, office equipment, distribution center equipment, and vehicles. Some of the Company's leases include options to extend or early terminate the lease, which are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain to exercise and there is a significant economic incentive to exercise that option. Certain lease agreements contain provisions for future rent increases. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments. The Company combines lease and non-lease components as a single component. Operating lease cost is recognized over the expected lease term on a straight-line basis and is recorded in Distribution, Selling, and Administrative in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Variable lease payments, which are primarily comprised of maintenance, taxes, and other payments based on usage, are recognized when the expense is incurred. The Company's leases do not contain residual value guarantees. \n\nManufacturer Incentives \n\nThe Company considers fees and other incentives received from its suppliers relating to the purchase and distribution of inventory to represent product discounts, and, as a result, they are recognized within cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory. \n\nProperty and Equipment \n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and from 3 to 10 years for machinery, equipment, and other. The costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. \n\nThe Company capitalizes project costs relating to computer software developed or obtained for internal use when the activities related to the project reach the application development stage. Costs that are associated with preliminary stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as they are incurred. Software development costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 10 years. \n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances for the periods indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START September 30, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Property and equipment, at cost: Land $ 122,426 &#160; $ 129,944 &#160; Buildings and improvements 840,852 &#160; 838,615 &#160; Machinery, equipment, and other 3,424,070 &#160; 3,113,132 &#160; Total property and equipment 4,387,348 &#160; 4,081,691 &#160; Less accumulated depreciation ( 2,252,345 ) ( 1,918,730 ) Property and equipment, net $ 2,135,003 &#160; $ 2,162,961 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company's revenues are primarily generated from the distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Company also generates revenues from global commercialization services, which include clinical trial support, post-approval and commercialization support, and global specialty transportation and logistics for the biopharmaceutical industry. See Note 15 for the Company's disaggregated revenue. \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue related to the distribution of products at a point in time when title and control transfers to customers and there is no further obligation to provide services related to such products. Service revenue is recognized over the period that services are provided to the customer. The Company is generally the principal in a transaction; \n\nTable of Contents \n\ntherefore, revenue is primarily recorded on a gross basis. When the Company is the principal in a transaction, it has determined that it controls the ability to direct the use of the product or service prior to the transfer to a customer, it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the product or service to its customer, it has discretion in establishing pricing, and it controls the relationship with the customer. Revenue is recognized at the amount of consideration expected to be received. For the distribution business, revenue is primarily generated from a contract related to a confirmed purchase order with a customer in a distribution arrangement and is net of estimated sales returns and allowances, other customer incentives, and sales tax. \n\nWhen the Company is the agent in a transaction, the fee received from a manufacturer customer is recognized within revenue as the service is performed. \n\nThe Company's customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. The Company records an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical return trends. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company's accrual for estimated customer sales returns was $ 1,532.1 million and $ 1,271.6 million, respectively. \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company accounts for the compensation cost of all share-based payments at fair value. The fair value of restricted stock units and performance stock units is based upon the grant date market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The Company estimated the fair value of options granted in fiscal 2020 using a binomial option pricing model. \n\nShare-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period within Distribution, Selling, and Administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to correspond with the same line item as the cash compensation paid to employees. Compensation expense associated with nonvested performance stock units is dependent upon the Company's periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and its estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. \n\nThe income tax effects of awards are recognized when the awards vest or are settled and are recognized in Income Tax Expense in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nShipping and Handling Costs \n\nShipping and handling costs include all costs to warehouse, pick, pack, and deliver inventory to customers. These costs, which were $ 1,040.8 million, $ 809.3 million, and $ 665.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, are included in Distribution, Selling, and Administrative in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nSupplier Reserves \n\nThe Company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them from the Company. These reserve estimates are established based upon the judgment of Company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs, and any other pertinent information available to the Company. The Company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based upon changes in factual circumstances. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different than the Company's estimate. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNote 2. Acquisition and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale \n\nAcquisition \n\nOn June 1, 2021, the Company acquired a majority of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.'s (\"WBA\") Alliance Healthcare businesses (\"Alliance Healthcare\") for $ 6,662.0 million in cash, $ 229.1 million of the Company's common stock ( 2 million shares at the Company's June 1, 2021 opening stock price of $ 114.54 per share), and $ 6.1 million of other equity consideration. The net cash payment was $ 5,596.7 million, as the Company acquired $ 922.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $ 143.3 million of restricted cash. The shares issued were from the Company's treasury stock on a first-in, first-out basis and were originally purchased for $ 149.1 million. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company's previous estimate of $ 96.9 million of accrued consideration was settled for $ 60.0 million, which resulted in a $ 36.9 million reduction to Goodwill. The $ 60.0 million cash payment is included in the total $ 6,662.0 million cash consideration. The Company funded the cash purchase price through a combination of cash on hand and new debt financing. The acquisition expands the Company's reach and solutions in pharmaceutical distribution and adds to the Company's depth and breadth of global manufacturer services. \n\nThe Company completed the purchase price allocation as of June 1, 2022 and recorded purchase accounting adjustments that reduced working capital account balances by $ 102.7 million, increased the corresponding deferred tax assets by $ 63.0 million, and decreased other assets by $ 13.3 million, which resulted in a $ 53.0 million increase to Goodwill. There were no measurement period adjustments recorded to the previously-reported opening balance sheet that would have had a material impact on the Company's previously-reported results of operations had those adjustments been recorded in the previous reporting periods. The final purchase price has been allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition in the table that follows: \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) Consideration Cash $ 6,662,020 &#160; \n\nEquity ( 2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation common stock) \n\n229,080 &#160; Other equity consideration 6,061 &#160; Fair value of total consideration $ 6,897,161 &#160; Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and cash equivalents $ 921,995 &#160; Accounts receivable 3,628,056 &#160; Inventories 1,647,330 &#160; Prepaid expenses and other 355,030 &#160; Property and equipment 634,220 &#160; Goodwill 2,496,338 &#160; Other intangible assets 3,735,000 &#160; Deferred income taxes 33,922 &#160; Other assets 534,393 &#160; Total assets acquired 13,986,284 &#160; Accounts payable ( 4,618,807 ) Accrued expenses and other ( 765,463 ) Short-term debt ( 353,420 ) Deferred income taxes ( 760,937 ) Other liabilities ( 405,332 ) Total liabilities assumed ( 6,903,959 ) Net assets acquired 7,082,325 &#160; Noncontrolling interest ( 185,164 ) Equity consideration ( 235,141 ) \n\nCash acquired, including restricted cash of $ 143,308 included in Prepaid Expenses and Other \n\n( 1,065,303 ) Net cash paid $ 5,596,717 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe estimated fair value of the intangible assets acquired of $ 3.7 billion and the estimated useful lives are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands, except useful lives) Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer relationships $ 3,327,000 &#160; 18 Trade names 408,000 &#160; 11 Total $ 3,735,000 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill resulting from this acquisition is no t expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. \n\nThe fair value of the $ 185.2 million noncontrolling interest in Alliance Healthcare Egypt, a 50 %-owned subsidiary, was estimated by applying income and market-based approaches. This fair value measurement is based on inputs that are not observable in the market and; therefore, represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe Company incurred $ 90.9 million of acquisition-related costs in connection with this acquisition. These costs are included in Acquisition, Integration, and Restructuring Expenses in the Company's Statements of Operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nSee Part I. Other Information-Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional risk factors related to our strategic transactions with WBA. \n\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale \n\nThe Company entered into agreements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to sell two of its non-core subsidiaries. In connection with entering into these agreements, the Company concluded that both disposal groups met the held for sale criteria and classified their assets and liabilities as held for sale as of September 30, 2021. One disposal group was included within the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment and the other disposal group was included within International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment. \n\nIn connection with the held for sale classification, the Company recorded a total loss of $ 16.3 million on the remeasurement of the disposal group held for sale in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment to fair value less cost to sell, $ 4.9 million of which was recorded in Impairment of Assets on its Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The Company previously recorded a loss of $ 11.3 million in fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The Company completed the sales of the disposal groups in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and received total proceeds of $ 267.6 million, subject to final working capital adjustments. In connection with the sales of these disposal groups, the Company recorded a gain of $ 52.6 million, which is included in Other Income, Net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nTotal assets and liabilities of the combined disposal groups held for sale on the September 30, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheet are comprised of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,751 &#160; Accounts receivable, less allowance for credit losses 182,077 &#160; Inventories 123,424 &#160; Prepaid expenses and other 11,258 &#160; Property and equipment 3,084 &#160; Goodwill 31,903 &#160; Other intangible assets 22,923 &#160; Other assets 7,812 &#160; Loss on the remeasurement of a disposal group held for sale to fair value less cost to sell ( 11,324 ) Total assets held for sale $ 372,908 &#160; Accounts payable $ 173,104 &#160; Accrued expenses and other 7,234 &#160; Short-term debt 4,225 &#160; Long-term debt 50 &#160; Deferred income taxes 5,857 &#160; Other liabilities 1,599 &#160; Total liabilities held for sale $ 192,069 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nNote 3.

The UK government Finance Act 2021 includes a provision to increase the corporate tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning on April 1, 2023. As a result, the Company recognized a deferred tax expense of $ 127.6 million to increase its deferred tax liabilities for the change in the tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act became law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act was a response to the market volatility and instability resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and included provisions to support businesses in the form of loans, grants, and tax changes, among other types of relief that were not previously available under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\"). The CARES Act provided the Company relief through adjustments to net operating loss rules and the acceleration of available refunds for alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. \n\nPharMEDium \n\nThe Company decided in January 2020 to shut down and permanently exit its compounding business. Following the decision to exit PharMEDium and in connection with the permanent shutdown of this business, PharMEDium underwent a voluntary change in tax status, which resulted in the Company recognizing a worthless stock ordinary income tax deduction of approximately $ 2.4 billion and, in turn, yielded a tax benefit of approximately $ 655 million. The estimated tax benefit was higher than it would have been prior to the enactment of the CARES Act as the net operating losses resulting from the worthless stock deduction could now be carried back to years with higher statutory tax rates. \n\nIn addition to the PharMEDium worthless stock deduction, the Company recognized other discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the CARES Act. In the aggregate, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits of $ 720.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. \n\nThe Company's September 30, 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a current income tax receivable balance of $ 172.6 million primarily resulting from the recognition of the above discrete tax benefits. \n\nSwiss Tax Reform \n\nIn August 2020, the Canton of Bern enacted tax reforms to comply with requirements imposed by earlier Swiss federal tax reforms, which were retroactively effective as of January 1, 2020. A key provision of the Swiss federal tax reforms was the elimination of cantonal preferential tax regimes, which had the effect of increasing overall tax rates on Swiss income. To phase in the tax rate increase, the canton of Bern granted a tax ruling to the Company that effectively reduces the Company's Swiss tax rate for a period of 10 years. \n\nAs a result of the aforementioned Swiss tax law change and ruling, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 that is expected to be realized over the following 10 years. As of September 30, 2022, the deferred tax asset of $ 446.6 million was reduced by a $ 234.0 million valuation allowance for the amount that more likely than not will not be realized. \n\nIn November 2020, the Canton of Bern approved its Budget 2021, which called for lowering its corporate income tax rate applicable to the Company&#8217;s Swiss operations effective October 1, 2020. As a result, the Company recognized a deferred tax expense to reduce its Swiss deferred tax asset for the change in tax rate. \n\nOpioid Legal Accrual \n\nIn the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company recorded accruals related to the opioid litigation settlements of $ 36.6 million, $ 147.7 million, and $ 6.6 billion, respectively (see Note 13). The Company's September 30, 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a net deferred tax asset of $ 981.6 million in connection with the total expense accrued. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities (assets) are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; September 30, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Inventories $ 1,471,064 &#160; $ 1,388,913 &#160; Property and equipment 149,896 &#160; 167,974 &#160; Goodwill and other intangible assets 1,184,477 &#160; 1,409,296 &#160; Right-of-use assets 219,616 &#160; 249,920 &#160; Other 61,148 &#160; 57,450 &#160; Gross deferred tax liabilities 3,086,201 &#160; 3,273,553 &#160; Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards ( 426,651 ) ( 389,724 ) Allowance for credit losses ( 67,788 ) ( 27,569 ) Accrued expenses ( 24,435 ) ( 13,411 ) Accrued litigation liability ( 981,627 ) ( 1,082,845 ) Employee and retiree benefits ( 22,682 ) ( 26,196 ) Goodwill and other intangible assets ( 446,605 ) ( 488,235 ) Lease liabilities ( 241,469 ) ( 263,278 ) Share-based compensation ( 33,933 ) ( 37,466 ) Other ( 75,428 ) ( 88,855 ) Gross deferred tax assets ( 2,320,618 ) ( 2,417,579 ) Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 617,259 &#160; 538,531 &#160; Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance ( 1,703,359 ) ( 1,879,048 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ 1,382,842 &#160; $ 1,394,505 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had $ 2.6 million of potential tax benefits from federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 15 years, $ 136.0 million of potential tax benefits from state net operating loss carryforwards and $ 297.2 million of potential tax benefits from foreign net operating loss carryforwards, which have varying expiration dates. The Company had $ 6.0 million of state tax credit carryforwards and $ 3.1 million in foreign alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. \n\nThe Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. As a result of this assessment, valuation allowances have been recorded on certain deferred tax assets. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company increased the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $ 78.7 million and $ 126.9 million, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance against foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The increase in the valuation allowance in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to the valuation allowance established in connection with purchase accounting associated with Alliance Healthcare acquisition. \n\nIn the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 tax benefits of $ 13.4 million, $ 8.2 million and $ 3.9 million, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options and lapses of restricted stock units were recorded in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The tax benefits recognized in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may arise in future periods. \n\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds, were $ 244.4 million, $ 93.5 million, and $ 139.4 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nCumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries were $ 3.7 billion as of September 30, 2022, $ 2.1 billion of which is considered permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the taxes that would be due if such earnings were to be repatriated in the future. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently undergoing a U.S. federal income tax audit for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 and certain state and local income tax audits for various years. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax \n\nTable of Contents \n\nexaminations for years before 2018, and state and local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. The Company believes it has adequate tax reserves to cover potential federal, state or foreign tax exposures. \n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the benefits recognized in the Company's financial statements, of $ 553.2 million and $ 522.8 million, respectively ($ 479.6 million and $ 467.9 million, net of federal tax benefit, respectively). If recognized in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, $ 461.4 million and $ 449.7 million, respectively, of these benefits would have reduced income tax expense and the effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, included in the unrecognized tax benefits are $ 26.7 million and $ 22.4 million of interest and penalties, respectively, which the Company records in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the periods indicated is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of period $ 500,399 &#160; $ 478,351 &#160; $ 105,657 &#160; Additions of tax positions of the current year 21,074 &#160; 20,515 &#160; 385,797 &#160; Additions to tax positions of the prior years 5,073 &#160; 17,022 &#160; 5,599 &#160; Reductions of tax positions of the prior years &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 6,480 ) Expiration of statutes of limitations ( 24 ) ( 15,489 ) ( 12,222 ) Unrecognized tax benefits at end of period $ 526,522 &#160; $ 500,399 &#160; $ 478,351 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncluded in the additions of unrecognized tax benefits in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 is $ 371.5 million for an unrecognized tax benefit related to the $ 6.6 billion legal accrual for litigation related to the global opioid settlement, as well as other opioid-related litigation, as disclosed in Note 13. The Company has applied significant judgment in estimating the amount of the opioid settlements that will be deductible for U.S. federal and state purposes. In estimating the amount that would be deductible, the Company considered prior U.S. tax case law, the amount and character of the damages sought in litigation, and other relevant factors. During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitations could result in a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $ 21.2 million. \n\nNote 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nIn connection with the change in the Company's reporting structure that is discussed in Note 1, the Company reallocated goodwill among the impacted reporting units using a relative fair value approach and assessed impairment before and after goodwill was reallocated. The following is a summary of the changes in the carrying value of goodwill, by reportable segment, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) U.S. Healthcare Solutions International Healthcare Solutions Total Goodwill as of September 30, 2020 (as revised) $ 6,267,502 &#160; $ 439,217 &#160; $ 6,706,719 &#160; Goodwill recognized in connection with acquisitions (Note 2) 19,076 &#160; 2,469,152 &#160; 2,488,228 &#160; Goodwill impairment &#8212; &#160; ( 6,373 ) ( 6,373 ) Goodwill reclassified to assets held for sale (Note 2) ( 27,223 ) ( 4,680 ) ( 31,903 ) Foreign currency translation 1,019 &#160; ( 127,159 ) ( 126,140 ) Goodwill as of September 30, 2021 (as revised) 6,260,374 &#160; 2,770,157 &#160; 9,030,531 &#160; Purchase accounting adjustments &#8212; &#160; 27,186 &#160; 27,186 &#160; Goodwill recognized in connection with acquisition 26,143 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 26,143 &#160; Goodwill derecognized in connection with disposal ( 1,224 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 1,224 ) Goodwill impairment &#8212; &#160; ( 75,936 ) ( 75,936 ) Foreign currency translation ( 5,053 ) ( 497,761 ) ( 502,814 ) Goodwill as of September 30, 2022 $ 6,280,240 &#160; $ 2,223,646 &#160; $ 8,503,886 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nIn connection with the Company's annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2021, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $ 6.4 million in its Profarma reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined based upon Profarma's publicly-traded stock price, plus an estimated control premium. This represents a level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAs a result of a prolonged decline in Profarma&#8217;s stock price, the Company performed an impairment assessment over the Profarma reporting unit as of June 30, 2022 and recorded a goodwill impairment of $ 75.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The Company determined the fair value of the Profarma reporting unit based upon Profarma&#8217;s publicly-traded stock price, plus an estimated control premium. This represents a level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement. \n\nIn connection with the Profarma impairment assessment, the Company first performed a recoverability assessment of Profarma&#8217;s long-lived assets by comparing the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the Profarma asset group, and it was determined to be recoverable. However, the forecasted undiscounted cash flows used to perform the recoverability assessment are inherently uncertain and include assumptions that could differ from actual results in future periods. \n\nThe following is a summary of other intangible assets: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 (dollars in thousands) Weighted Average Remaining Useful Life Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Indefinite-lived trade names $ 667,932 &#160; $ &#8212; $ 667,932 &#160; $ 668,119 &#160; $ &#8212; $ 668,119 &#160; Finite-lived: Customer relationships 15 years 4,226,547 &#160; ( 931,961 ) 3,294,586 &#160; 4,838,549 &#160; ( 718,750 ) 4,119,799 &#160; Trade names and other 11 years 542,346 &#160; ( 172,127 ) 370,219 &#160; 609,050 &#160; ( 140,041 ) 469,009 &#160; Total other intangible assets $ 5,436,825 &#160; $ ( 1,104,088 ) $ 4,332,737 &#160; $ 6,115,718 &#160; $ ( 858,791 ) $ 5,256,927 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe decreases in the gross amounts of finite-lived intangible assets since September 30, 2021 were primarily due to foreign currency translation. \n\nAmortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $ 307.3 million, $ 178.3 million, and $ 110.9 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets is estimated to be $ 275.5 million in fiscal 2023, $ 274.3 million in fiscal 2024, $ 273.3 million in fiscal 2025, $ 268.9 million in fiscal 2026, $ 264.2 million in 2027, and $ 2,308.6 million thereafter. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNote 6.

In October 2022, the Company amended the Multi-currecy Revolving Credit Facility to extend the expiration to October 2027 and to make certain changes to effect a transition from the LIBOR interest rate benchmark to Term SOFR. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based upon the Company's debt rating and ranges from 80.5 basis points to 122.5 basis points over SOFR/EURIBOR/CDOR/RFR, as applicable ( 101.5 basis points over CDOR/LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee as of September 30, 2022) and from 0 basis points to 22.5 basis points over the alternate base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable. The Company pays facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on its debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 15 basis points, annually, of the total commitment ( 11 basis points as of September 30, 2022). The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which the Company was compliant as of September 30, 2022. \n\nCommercial Paper Program \n\nThe Company has a commercial paper program whereby it may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $ 2.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase the Company's borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by the Company's Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nReceivables Securitization Facility \n\nThe Company has a $ 1,450 million receivables securitization facility (\"Receivables Securitization Facility\"), which was scheduled to expire in November 2024. In October 2022, the Company amended the Receivables Securitization Facility (the &#8220;Receivables Amendment&#8221;) to extend the expiration for an additional one year to October 2025. In addition, the Receivables Amendment made certain changes to (i) substitute Term SOFR for LIBOR as a benchmark and establish procedures to choose a new benchmark if Term SOFR becomes unavailable, (ii) provide for the return of erroneous payments, if any, by purchasers, (iii) update provisions regarding compliance with sanctions and anti-money laundering laws, and (iv) implement certain other technical amendments. The Company has available to it an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $ 250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or 30-day Term SOFR, plus a program fee. The Company pays a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. \n\nIn connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation and a specialty distribution subsidiary sell on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. As sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. The facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the Company because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade accounts, which are generally non-interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which the Company was compliant as of September 30, 2022. \n\nRevolving Credit Note, Overdraft Facility, and Money Market Facility \n\nThe Company has an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to it pursuant to a revolving credit note (\"Revolving Credit Note\"). The Revolving Credit Note provides the Company with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $ 75 million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or the Company at any time without prior notice. The Company also has an uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility (\"Overdraft Facility\") to fund short-term normal trading cycle fluctuations related to its MWI Animal Health business. In February 2021, the Company extended the Overdraft Facility to February 2024 and reduced the borrowing capacity from &#163; 30 million to &#163; 10 million. The Company has an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to it pursuant to a money market credit agreement (\"Money Market Facility\"). The Money Market Facility provides the Company with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $ 100 million. The Money Market Facility may be decreased or terminated by the bank or the Company at any time without prior notice. \n\nTerm Loans \n\nThe Company's $ 400 million October 2018 Term Loan matured and was repaid in October 2020. \n\nIn February 2021, the Company entered into a $ 1.0 billion variable-rate term loan (&#8220;February 2021 Term Loan&#8221;), which was available to be drawn on the closing date of the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare.

In June 2021, the Company borrowed $ 500 million under the February 2021 Term Loan to finance a portion of the June 2021 Alliance Healthcare acquisition. The Company elected to make principal payments of $ 250 million in September 2021 and again in March 2022 to repay the loan that was scheduled to mature in 2023. \n\nSenior Notes \n\nIn May 2020, the Company issued $ 500 million of 2.80 % senior notes due May 15, 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\"). The 2030 Notes were sold at 99.71 % of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 2.81 %. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on November 15, 2020. The 2030 Notes rank pari passu to the Company's other senior notes, the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Note, the Overdraft Facility, and the Money Market Facility. \n\nThe Company used the proceeds from the 2030 Notes to finance the early retirement of the $ 500 million of 3.50 % senior notes that were due in 2021 and made a $ 21.4 million prepayment premium in connection with this early retirement. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn March 2021, the Company issued $ 1,525 million of 0.737 % senior notes due March 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\").

The Company used the proceeds from the 2023 Notes and the 2031 Notes to finance a portion of the June 2021 Alliance Healthcare acquisition. \n\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company elected to repay $ 850 million of 2023 Notes due in March 2023. \n\nThe senior notes discussed above and also illustrated in the above debt table are collectively referred to as the \"Notes.\" Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. Most of the Notes were sold at small discounts to the principal amounts and, therefore, have effective yields that are greater than the stated interest rates in the table above. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Notes were deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the Notes. The indentures governing the Notes contain restrictions and covenants, which include limitations on additional indebtedness; distributions to stockholders; the repurchase of stock and the making of other restricted payments; issuance of preferred stock; creation of certain liens; transactions with subsidiaries and other affiliates; and certain corporate acts such as mergers, consolidations, and the sale of substantially all assets. An additional covenant requires compliance with a financial leverage ratio test. The Company was compliant with all covenants as of September 30, 2022. \n\nAlliance Healthcare Debt \n\nAlliance Healthcare debt is comprised of uncommitted revolving credit facilities in various currencies with various rates.

The Benefits Committee is responsible for the investment options under the Company's savings plans, as well as performance of the investment advisers and plan administrators. \n\nRetirement Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company sponsors the AmerisourceBergen Employee Investment Plan (the \"Plan\"), which is a defined contribution 401(k) plan covering salaried and certain hourly employees. Eligible participants may contribute to the plan from 1 % to 50 % of their regular compensation before taxes. The Company contributes $ 1.00 for each $1.00 invested by the participant up to the first 3 % of the participant's salary and $ 0.50 for each additional $1.00 invested by the participant of up to an additional 2 % of salary. An additional discretionary contribution, in an amount not to exceed the limits established by the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\"), may also be made depending upon the Company's performance.

Option terms and vesting periods are determined at the date of grant by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors. Employee stock options generally vest ratably, in equal amounts, over a four-year service period and expire in seven years . The Company's non-employee director stock option plans provide for the granting of nonqualified stock options to acquire shares of common stock to non-employee directors at the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Non-employee director stock options vest ratably, in equal amounts, over a three-year service period and expire in ten years . \n\nThe estimated fair value of options granted is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards and are net of estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates the fair values of option grants using a binomial option pricing model. Expected volatilities are based upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock and other factors, such as implied market volatility. The Company uses historical exercise data, taking into consideration the optionees' ages at grant date, to estimate the terms for which the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates during the terms of such options are based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \n\nThe Company did not grant any stock options to employees in fiscal 2022 and 2021, and it does not expect to grant any stock options in fiscal 2023. The weighted average fair values of the options granted during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was $ 16.61 . The following weighted average assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of options granted: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2020 Risk-free interest rate 1.66 % Expected dividend yield 1.86 % Volatility of common stock 28.17 % Expected life of the options 3.79 years ##TABLE_END \n\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized stock option expense of $ 2.2 million, $ 4.6 million and $ 13.0 million, respectively. \n\nA summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for its option plans for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands, except exercise price and contractual term) Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding as of September 30, 2021 3,138 &#160; $ 84 3 years $ 109,772 &#160; Exercised ( 1,189 ) $ 86 &#160; &#160; Forfeited ( 17 ) $ 89 &#160; &#160; Outstanding as of September 30, 2022 1,932 &#160; $ 83 3 years $ 100,496 &#160; Exercisable as of September 30, 2022 1,521 &#160; $ 82 2 years $ 81,000 &#160; Expected to vest after September 30, 2022 407 &#160; $ 88 4 years $ 19,283 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 60.3 million, $ 58.7 million, and $ 42.6 million, respectively. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nA summary of the status of the Company's nonvested options as of September 30, 2022 and changes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands, except grant date fair value) Options Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested as of September 30, 2021 1,046 &#160; $ 17 Vested ( 617 ) $ 16 Forfeited ( 17 ) $ 18 Nonvested as of September 30, 2022 412 &#160; $ 18 ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the total fair values of options vested were $ 10.0 million, $ 15.5 million, and $ 21.3 million, respectively. Expected future compensation expense relating to the 0.4 million nonvested options outstanding as of September 30, 2022 is $ 0.4 million, which will be recognized through November 2023. \n\nRestricted Stock Units \n\nRestricted stock units granted prior to fiscal 2021 vest in full after three years . The majority of the restricted stock units granted beginning in fiscal 2021 and thereafter vest ratably over a three-year period. The estimated fair value of restricted stock units under the Company's restricted stock unit plans is determined by the product of the number of shares granted and the closing grant date market price of the Company's common stock. The estimated fair value of restricted stock units is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized restricted stock unit expense of $ 71.3 million, $ 55.8 million, and $ 39.8 million, respectively. \n\nA summary of the status of the Company's nonvested restricted stock units as of September 30, 2022 and changes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 are presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands, except grant date fair value) Restricted Stock Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested as of September 30, 2021 1,838 &#160; $ 98 Granted 726 &#160; $ 127 Vested ( 592 ) $ 98 Forfeited ( 166 ) $ 106 Nonvested as of September 30, 2022 1,806 &#160; $ 108 ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the total fair values of restricted stock units vested were $ 58.1 million, $ 31.1 million, and $ 26.4 million, respectively. Expected future compensation expense relating to the 1.8 million restricted stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2022 is $ 71.2 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 years. \n\nPerformance Stock Units \n\nPerformance stock units are granted to certain executive employees under the Plan and represent common stock potentially issuable in the future. Performance stock units vest at the end of a three-year performance period based upon achievement of specific performance goals. Based upon the extent to which the targets are achieved, vested shares may range from 0 % to 200 % of the target award amount. The fair value of performance stock units is determined by the grant date market price of the Company's common stock. Compensation expense associated with nonvested performance stock units is recognized over the requisite service period and is dependent on the Company's periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and its estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized performance stock expense of $ 19.7 million, $ 38.9 million, and $ 21.5 million, respectively. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nA summary of the status of the Company's nonvested performance stock units as of September 30, 2022 and changes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is presented below (based upon target award amounts). \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands, except grant date fair value) Performance Stock Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested as of September 30, 2021 296 &#160; $ 98 Granted 131 &#160; $ 126 Vested ( 148 ) $ 86 Forfeited ( 2 ) $ 117 Nonvested as of September 30, 2022 277 &#160; $ 117 ##TABLE_END\n\nShares that vested over the three-year performance period ended September 30, 2022 were distributed to employees in November 2022. \n\nNote 11.

The Company records a reserve for these matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. \n\nFor those matters for which the Company has not recognized a liability, the Company cannot predict the outcome of their impact on the Company as uncertainty remains with regard to whether such matters will proceed to trial, whether settlements will be reached, and the amount and terms of any such settlements. Outcomes may include settlements in significant amounts that are not currently estimable, limitations on the Company &#8217; s conduct, the imposition of corporate integrity agreement obligations, consent decrees, and/or other civil and criminal penalties. From time to time, the Company is also involved in disputes with its customers, which the Company generally seeks to resolve through commercial negotiations. If negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties may litigate the dispute or otherwise attempt to settle the matter. \n\nWith respect to the specific legal proceedings and claims described below, unless otherwise noted, the amount or range of possible losses is not reasonably estimable. There can be no assurance that the settlement, resolution, or other outcome of one or more matters, including the matters set forth below, during any subsequent reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on the Company &#8217; s results of operations or cash flows for that period or on the Company's financial condition. \n\nOpioid Lawsuits and Investigations \n\nA significant number of counties, municipalities, and other governmental entities in a majority of U.S. states and Puerto Rico, as well as numerous states and tribes, filed lawsuits in various federal, state and other courts against pharmaceutical wholesale distributors (including the Company and certain subsidiaries, such as AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (&#8220;ABDC&#8221;) and H.D. Smith), pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacy chains, medical practices, and physicians relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. \n\nAn initial group of cases was consolidated for Multidistrict Litigation (&#8220;MDL&#8221;) proceedings before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (the &#8220;Court&#8221;) in December 2017. In April 2018, the Court issued an order creating a litigation track, which included dispositive motion practice, discovery, and trials in certain bellwether jurisdictions. In November 2019 and January 2020, the Court filed Suggestions of Remand with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation that identified four cases filed against the Company for potential transfer from the MDL back to federal courts in California, Oklahoma, and West Virginia for the completion of discovery, motion practice, and trial. All four cases were remanded to those federal district courts. Trial in the two consolidated cases in West Virginia commenced in May 2021 and concluded in July 2021. On July 4, 2022, the court entered judgment in favor of the defendants, including the Company. The plaintiffs filed an appeal of the court&#8217;s decision on August 2, 2022. The Oklahoma case, in which the plaintiff was the Cherokee Nation, was resolved through a settlement with the Cherokee Nation, as announced on September 28, 2021. The California case, in which the plaintiff was the City and County of San Francisco, was resolved pursuant to the comprehensive settlement described below, and all claims against the Company have been dismissed in both cases. \n\nOn July 21, 2021, the Company announced that it and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a comprehensive settlement agreement that, if all conditions were satisfied, would result in the resolution of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. The comprehensive settlement agreement became effective on April 2, 2022 and as of September 30, 2022, it included 48 of 49 eligible states (the &#8220;Settling States&#8221;) as well as 99 % by population of the eligible political subdivisions in the Settling States. Pursuant to the comprehensive settlement agreement and related agreements with Settling States, the Company will pay up to approximately $ 6.4 billion o ver 18 years and comply with other requirements, including establishment of a clearinghouse that will consolidate data from all three national distributors. The exact payment amount will depend on several factors, including the extent to which states take action to foreclose opioid lawsuits by subdivisions (e.g., laws barring opioid lawsuits by subdivisions). West Virginia and its \n\nTable of Contents \n\nsubdivisions and Native American tribes are not a part of the comprehensive settlement agreement and the Company has reached separate agreements with these groups. \n\nOn July 22, 2022, the State of Alabama sought and was subsequently granted leave to amend its complaint in a pending state court action against another distributor in order to add the Company as a party. The amended Complaint was filed on July 25, 2022. \n\nThe Company recorded accruals related to opioid litigation of $ 36.6 million, $ 147.7 million, and $ 6.6 billion in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 in Litigation and Opioid-Related Expenses in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company&#8217;s accrued litigation liability related to the comprehensive settlement, including an estimate for the State of Alabama (with whom the Company has not reached a settlement agreement), as well as other opioid-related litigation for which it has reached settlement agreements, as described above, was $ 6.0 billion as of September 30, 2022 and $ 6.7 billion as of September 30, 2021. The Company currently estimates that $ 528.7 million will be paid prior to September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining long-term liability of $ 5.5 billion is recorded in Accrued Litigation Liability on the Company &#8217; s Consolidated Balance Sheet. While the Company has accrued its estimated liability for opioid litigation, it is unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with the matters that are not included in the settlement accrual. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews opioid litigation matters to determine whether its accrual is adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued to date. Until such time as otherwise resolved, the Company will continue to litigate and prepare for trial and to vigorously defend itself in all such matters. Since these matters are still developing, the Company is unable to predict the outcome, but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect the Company &#8217; s operations. \n\nOther lawsuits regarding the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications have been filed by: third-party payors and similar entities; hospitals; hospital groups; and individuals, including cases styled as putative class actions. These lawsuits, which have been and continue to be filed in federal, state, and other courts, generally allege violations of controlled substance laws and various other statutes as well as common law claims, including negligence, public nuisance, and unjust enrichment, and seek equitable relief and monetary damages. Motion practice and active discovery are ongoing in many of these cases. Ongoing and additional litigation is anticipated in cases filed by subdivisions that are not participating in the global settlement agreement, as well as in cases filed by non-governmental or non-political entities, including hospitals, third-party payors, and individuals, among others. Certain cases related to opioids filed in various state courts have trial dates scheduled in January 2023 and later, although all such dates are subject to change. The Company is vigorously defending itself in the pending lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend itself against any threatened lawsuits or enforcement proceedings. \n\nSince July 2017, the Company has received subpoenas from several U.S. Attorney &#8217; s Offices, including grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney &#8217; s Office for the District of New Jersey ( &#8220; USAO-NJ&#8221;) and the U.S. Attorney &#8217; s Office for the Eastern District of New York ( &#8220; USAO-EDNY&#8221;). Those subpoenas request the production of a broad range of documents pertaining to the Company &#8217; s distribution of controlled substances through its various subsidiaries, including ABDC, and its diversion control programs. The Company has produced documents in response to the subpoenas and continues to engage in discussions with the various U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Offices, including the Health Care and Government Fraud Unit of the Criminal Division of the USAO-NJ, the U.S. Department of Justice Consumer Protection Branch and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, in an attempt to resolve these matters. \n\nShareholder Securities Litigation \n\nOn October 11, 2019, Teamsters Local 443 Health Services &#38; Insurance Plan, St. Paul Electrical Construction Pension Plan, St. Paul Electrical Construction Workers Supplemental Pension Plan (2014 Restatement), Retirement Medical Funding Plan for the St. Paul Electrical Workers, and San Antonio Fire &#38; Police Pension Fund filed a complaint for a purported derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors (collectively, &#8220; Defendants&#8221;). The complaint alleges that the Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to oversee the compliance by certain of the Company &#8217; s subsidiaries (including the Company &#8217; s former subsidiary Medical Initiatives, Inc. ( &#8220; MII&#8221;)) with federal regulations, allegedly resulting in the payment of fines and penalties in connection with the settlements with the USAO-EDNY in fiscal 2017 and 2018 that resolved claims arising from MII &#8217; s pre-filled syringe program. In December 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. After briefing and oral argument, on August 24, 2020 the Delaware Court of Chancery denied Defendants &#8217; motion to dismiss. On September 24, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company established a Special Litigation Committee to conduct an investigation concerning the plaintiffs&#8217; allegations, and on November 10, 2020, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the Special Litigation Committee&#8217;s motion to stay the litigation pending its investigation. On September 22, 2021, the Special Litigation Committee filed its report under seal and moved to dismiss the case. The Special Litigation Committee&#8217;s motion to dismiss the case is pending. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOn July 17, 2020, CCAR Investments, Inc. filed a complaint for a purported derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors (&#8220;CCAR Defendants&#8221;). The complaint allegedclaims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and unjust enrichment allegedly arising from the Board's oversight of the Company&#8217;s controlled substance diversion control programs and violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). On August 14, 2020, the CCAR Defendants answered the complaint and filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On October 29, 2020 the parties filed a stipulation permitting CCAR Investments, Inc. to file an amended complaint on or before November 20, 2020. On December 4, 2020, the parties filed a stipulation tolling the deadline for CCAR Investments, Inc. to file an amended complaint pending the Company&#8217;s production of certain documents to CCAR Investments, Inc. The Company&#8217;s production was completed on January 29, 2021. On May 2, 2022, the Court entered a stipulation that the case will be dismissed without prejudice upon the Company providing notice to stockholders through the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K and subsequent notification to the Court of such filing. On May 6, 2022, the Company provided notice to stockholders through the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K that the case would be dismissed and gave notice to the Court of the Form 8-K filing. \n\nOn December 30, 2021, Lebanon County Employees &#8217; Retirement Fund and Teamsters Local 443 Health Services &#38; Insurance Plan filed a complaint for a purported derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain of its current officers and directors. The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty allegedly arising from the Board&#8217;s and certain officers&#8217; oversight of the Company&#8217;s controlled substance diversion control programs. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on March 29, 2022. The motion is pending. \n\nSubpoenas, Ongoing Investigations, and Other Contingencies \n\nFrom time to time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies relating to the Company &#8217; s business or to the business of a customer, supplier, or other industry participant. The Company &#8217; s responses often require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred. Most of these matters are resolved without incident; however, such subpoenas or requests can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and other members of the healthcare industry, as well as to substantial settlements. \n\nIn January 2017, U.S. Bioservices Corporation (&#8220;U.S. Bio&#8221;), a former subsidiary of the Company, received a subpoena for information from the USAO-EDNY relating to its activities in connection with billing for products and making returns of potential overpayments to government payers. A filed qui tam complaint related to the investigation was unsealed in April 2019 and the relator filed an amended complaint under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In December 2019, the government filed a notice that it was declining to intervene. The court ordered that the relator &#8217; s complaint against the Company and other defendants, including AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, LLC, be unsealed. The relator&#8217;s complaint alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and the false claims acts of various states. The relator filed a second amended complaint, removing one state false claims act count. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint and all briefing on the motion was filed with the court on October 9, 2020. \n\nIn December 2019, Reliable Pharmacy, together with other retail pharmacies and North Sunflower Medical Center, filed a civil antitrust complaint against multiple generic drug manufacturers, and also included claims against ABDC and H.D. Smith (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221; for this matter description), and other drug distributors and industry participants. The case is filed as a putative class action and plaintiffs purport to represent a class of drug purchasers including other retail pharmacies and healthcare providers. The case has been consolidated for multidistrict litigation proceedings before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that the Company and others in the industry participated in a conspiracy to fix prices, allocate markets and rig bids regarding generic drugs. In March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a further amended complaint. On July 15, 2020, the Company and other industry participants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On May 25, 2022, the Court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice. On July 1, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, again including claims against the Company and other drug distributors and industry participants. On August 21, 2022, the Company and other industry participants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. \n\nOn March 3, 2022, the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Western District of Virginia notified the Company of the existence of a criminal investigation into MWI Veterinary Supply Co., the Company&#8217;s animal health subsidiary, in connection with grand jury subpoenas to which MWI previously responded relating to compliance with state and federal regulatory requirements governing wholesale shipments of animal health products to customers in certain states. The Company is cooperating with the investigation. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNote 14. Litigation Settlements \n\nAntitrust Settlements \n\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against certain brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. These lawsuits are generally brought as class actions. The Company has not been a named a plaintiff in any of these lawsuits, but has been a member of the direct purchasers&#8217; class (i.e., those purchasers who purchase directly from these pharmaceutical manufacturers). None of the lawsuits has gone to trial, but some have settled in the past with the Company receiving proceeds from the settlement funds. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized gains relating to these lawsuits of $ 1.8 million, $ 168.8 million, and $ 9.1 million, respectively. These gains, which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties, were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nNote 15. Business Segment Information \n\nThe Company is organized geographically based upon the products and services it provides to its customers. The Company&#8217;s reporting structure is comprised of two reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions. U.S. Healthcare Solutions consists of the legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment (excluding Profarma), MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group, and ICS 3PL. International Healthcare Solutions consists of Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, Innomar, Profarma, and Profarma Specialty (until it was divested in June 2022). Profarma had previously been included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment. The Company's previously reported segment results have been revised to conform to its realigned reporting structure. \n\nThe chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") of the Company is the Chairman, President &#38; Chief Executive Officer of the Company, whose function is to allocate resources to, and assess the performance of, the Company's operating segments. The CODM does not review assets by operating segment for the purpose of assessing performance or allocating resources. \n\nThe U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. It also provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that ranges from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. Additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. Through its animal health business, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. It also offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers. \n\nThe International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment consists of businesses that focus on international pharmaceutical wholesale and related service operations and global commercialization services. The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes pharmaceuticals, other healthcare products, and related services to healthcare providers, including pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals primarily in Europe. It also is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. In Canada, the business drives innovative partnerships with manufacturers, providers, and pharmacies to improve product access and efficiency throughout the healthcare supply chain. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following illustrates reportable and operating segment disaggregated revenue as required by ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" for the periods indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 U.S. Healthcare Solutions Human Health $ 207,284,444 &#160; $ 197,777,128 &#160; $ 182,171,487 &#160; Animal Health 4,815,758 &#160; 4,684,417 &#160; 4,216,462 &#160; Total U.S. Healthcare Solutions 212,100,202 &#160; 202,461,545 &#160; 186,387,949 &#160; International Healthcare Solutions Alliance Healthcare 21,890,402 &#160; 7,373,365 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other Healthcare Solutions 4,601,271 &#160; 4,156,264 &#160; 3,508,106 &#160; Total International Healthcare Solutions 26,491,673 &#160; 11,529,629 &#160; 3,508,106 &#160; Intersegment eliminations ( 4,869 ) ( 2,331 ) ( 2,129 ) Revenue $ 238,587,006 &#160; $ 213,988,843 &#160; $ 189,893,926 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe following illustrates reportable segment operating income information for the periods indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 U.S. Healthcare Solutions $ 2,456,972 &#160; $ 2,257,918 &#160; $ 2,020,067 &#160; International Healthcare Solutions 706,458 &#160; 390,286 &#160; 184,380 &#160; Total segment operating income $ 3,163,430 &#160; $ 2,648,204 &#160; $ 2,204,447 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following reconciles total segment operating income to income (loss) before income taxes for the periods indicated: ##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Total segment operating income $ 3,163,430 &#160; $ 2,648,204 &#160; $ 2,204,447 &#160; Gains from antitrust litigation settlements 1,835 &#160; 168,794 &#160; 9,076 &#160; LIFO (expense) credit ( 67,171 ) 203,028 &#160; ( 7,422 ) Turkey highly inflationary impact ( 40,033 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Acquisition-related intangibles amortization ( 304,551 ) ( 176,221 ) ( 110,478 ) Litigation and opioid-related expenses ( 123,191 ) ( 272,623 ) ( 6,722,346 ) Acquisition, integration, and restructuring expenses ( 183,059 ) ( 199,288 ) ( 84,961 ) Goodwill impairment ( 75,936 ) ( 6,373 ) &#8212; &#160; Impairment of assets ( 4,946 ) ( 11,324 ) ( 361,652 ) PharMEDium remediation costs &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 16,165 ) PharMEDium shutdown costs &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 43,206 ) New York State Opioid Stewardship Act &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 14,800 ) Contingent consideration adjustment &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 12,153 &#160; Operating income (loss) 2,366,378 &#160; 2,354,197 &#160; ( 5,135,354 ) Other income ( 27,352 ) ( 41,736 ) ( 1,581 ) Interest expense, net 210,673 &#160; 174,074 &#160; 137,883 &#160; Loss on early retirement of debt &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 22,175 &#160; Income (loss) before income taxes $ 2,183,057 &#160; $ 2,221,859 &#160; $ ( 5,293,831 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nSegment operating income is evaluated by the CODM of the Company and excludes gains from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO (expense) credit; Turkey highly inflationary impact; acquisition-related intangibles amortization; litigation and opioid-related expenses; acquisition, integration, and restructuring expenses; goodwill impairment; impairment of assets; \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPharMEDium remediation costs; PharMEDium shutdown costs; New York State Opioid Stewardship Act; and contingent consideration adjustment.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These controls and procedures also are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. \n\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other members of the Company's management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a &#8212; 15(e) and 15d &#8212; 15(e) under the Exchange Act) and have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective for their intended purposes as of the end of the period covered by this report. \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, those controls. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nThe management of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (\"AmerisourceBergen\" or the \"Company\") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. AmerisourceBergen's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \n\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; \n\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and \n\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nAmerisourceBergen's management assessed the effectiveness of AmerisourceBergen's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management's assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that AmerisourceBergen's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022. \n\nAmerisourceBergen's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &#38; Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of AmerisourceBergen's internal control over financial reporting. This report is set forth below. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AmerisourceBergen Corporation \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited AmerisourceBergen Corporation and subsidiaries&#8217; internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated November 22, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n##TABLE_START /s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP ##TABLE_END\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania \n\nNovember 22, 2022 \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"
