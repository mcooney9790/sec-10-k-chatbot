      "text": " Item 1. Business \n\nThe Company \n\nWe are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. Our services enable our customers to reduce manufacturing costs, improve supply-chain management, reduce inventory obsolescence, lower transportation costs and reduce product fulfillment time. Our manufacturing and supply chain management services and solutions include innovation, design, planning, fabrication and assembly, delivery and managing the flow of resources and products. \n\nWe serve our customers primarily through dedicated business units that combine highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability. We conduct our operations in facilities that are located worldwide, including but not limited to China, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and the United States. Our global manufacturing production sites allow customers to manufacture products simultaneously in the optimal locations for their products. Our global presence is key to assessing and executing on our business opportunities. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, we had net revenues of $33.5 billion and net income attributable to Jabil Inc. of $996 million. \n\nWe have two reporting segments: Electronics Manufacturing Services (&#8220;EMS&#8221;) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (&#8220;DMS&#8221;), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. Our EMS segment is focused around leveraging IT, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. Our EMS segment is a high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the 5G, wireless and cloud, digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap, and networking and storage industries. Our DMS segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, machining, tooling, and molding of highly engineered plastic and metal parts. Our DMS includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, connected devices, healthcare and packaging, and mobility industries. \n\nAdditional financial information regarding our reportable operating segments is included in Item 7 of this report and Note 13 &#8211; &#8220;Concentration of Risk and Segment Data&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIndustry Background \n\nThe industry in which we operate has historically been composed of companies that provide a range of design and manufacturing services to companies that utilize electronics components in their products. In recent years, the industry has expanded to include customers that require products and services beyond electronic components including plastics and metal components, packaging, and injection molding. \n\nWe monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances change. Over the long term we believe the factors driving our customers and potential customers to use our industry&#8217;s services include: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; Efficient Manufacturing. Manufacturing service providers are often able to manufacture products at a reduced total cost to companies. These cost advantages result from higher utilization of capacity and efficiencies of scale because of diversified product demand and, generally, a greater focus on the components of manufacturing cost. Companies are increasingly seeking to reduce their investment in inventory, facilities and equipment used in manufacturing and prioritizing capital investments in other activities such as sales and marketing and research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;). This strategic shift in capital deployment has contributed to increased demand for and interest in outsourcing to external manufacturing service providers. \n\n&#8226; Accelerated Product Time-to-Market and Time-to-Volume. Manufacturing service providers are often able to deliver accelerated production start-ups and achieve high efficiencies in bringing new products to production. Providers are also able to more rapidly scale production for changing markets and to position themselves in global locations that serve the leading world markets. With increasingly shorter product life cycles, these key services allow new products to be sold in the marketplace in an accelerated time frame. \n\n&#8226; Access to Advanced Design and Manufacturing Technologies. By utilizing manufacturing service providers, customers gain access to additional advanced technologies in manufacturing processes, as well as to product and \n\nproduction design, which can offer customers significant improvements in the performance, quality, cost, time-to-market and manufacturability of their products. \n\n&#8226; Improved Inventory Management and Purchasing Power. Manufacturing service providers are often able to more efficiently manage both procurement and inventory, and have demonstrated proficiency in purchasing components at improved pricing due to the scale of their operations and continuous interaction with the materials marketplace. \n\nOur Strategy \n\nOur vision for the future is to become the world&#8217;s most technologically advanced manufacturing services and solutions provider. As we work to achieve our vision, we continue to pursue the following strategies: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; Establish and Maintain Long-Term Customer Relationships. An important element of our strategy is to establish and maintain long-term relationships with leading companies in expanding industries with size and growth characteristics that can benefit from highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing on a global scale. We focus on maintaining long-term relationships with our customers and seek to expand these relationships to include additional product lines and services. In addition, we focus on identifying and developing relationships with new customers that meet our targeted profile, which includes financial stability, the need for technology-driven turnkey manufacturing, anticipated unit volume and long-term relationship stability. \n\n&#8226; Product Diversification. We focus on balancing our portfolio of products and product families to those that align with higher return areas of our business, including manufacturing, supply chain management services, comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services, 5G wireless, cloud, healthcare, automotive and transportation, and capital equipment. We have made concentrated efforts to diversify our industry sectors and customer base. Because of these efforts, we have experienced business growth from both existing and new customers as well as from acquisitions. \n\n&#8226; Utilize Customer-Centric Business Units. Most of our business units are dedicated to serve one customer each and operate by primarily utilizing dedicated production equipment, production workers, supervisors, buyers, planners and engineers to provide comprehensive manufacturing solutions that are customized to each customer&#8217;s needs. We believe our customer-centric business units promote increased responsiveness to our customers&#8217; needs, particularly for customer relationships that extend across multiple production locations. \n\n&#8226; Leverage Global Production. We believe that global production is a key strategy to reduce obsolescence risk and secure the lowest possible landed costs while simultaneously supplying products of equivalent or comparable quality throughout the world. Consistent with this strategy, we have established or acquired operations in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa. Our extensive global footprint positions us well to implement safe and practical solutions in order to select production locations which best serve the needs of our customers. We believe that our global footprint is strengthened by our centralized procurement process, which when coupled with our single Enterprise Resource Planning system affords our customers with end-to-end supply chain visibility. \n\n&#8226; Offer Systems Assembly, Direct-Order Fulfillment and Configure-to-Order Services. Our systems assembly, direct-order fulfillment and configure-to-order services allow our customers to reduce product cost and risk of product obsolescence by reducing total work-in-process and finished goods inventory. These services are available at all of our manufacturing locations. \n\n&#8226; Offer Design Services. We offer a wide spectrum of value-add design services to achieve improvements in performance, cost, time-to-market and manufacturability. \n\n&#8226; Pursue Acquisition Opportunities Selectively. The primary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors and with new customers and expand the scope of the services we can offer to our customers. \n\nOur Approach to Manufacturing \n\nTo achieve high levels of manufacturing performance, we have adopted the following approaches: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; Decentralized Business Unit Model. Most of our business units are dedicated to serve one customer each and are empowered to formulate strategies tailored to individual customer&#8217;s needs. Our business units generally have dedicated production lines consisting of equipment, production workers, supervisors, buyers, planners and engineers. Under certain circumstances, a production line may serve more than one business unit to maximize resource utilization. \n\nBusiness units have direct responsibility for manufacturing results and time-to-volume production, thereby promoting a sense of individual commitment and ownership. The business unit approach is modular and enables us to grow incrementally without disrupting the operations of other business units. Business unit management reviews the customer financial information to assess whether the business units are meeting their designated responsibilities and to ensure that the daily execution of manufacturing activities is being effectively managed. The business units aggregate into operating segments based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market share strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. \n\n&#8226; Automated Continuous Flow. We use a highly automated, continuous flow approach to manufacturing, whereby different pieces of equipment are joined directly or by conveyor to create an in-line assembly process. This process contrasts with a batch approach, whereby individual pieces of assembly equipment are operated as freestanding work-centers. The elimination of waiting time prior to sequential operations results in faster manufacturing, which improves production efficiencies and quality control, and reduces inventory work-in-process. We believe continuous flow manufacturing provides cost reductions and quality improvement when applied to high volumes of product. \n\n&#8226; Computerized Control and Monitoring. We support all aspects of our manufacturing activities with advanced computerized control and monitoring systems. Component inspection and vendor quality are monitored electronically in real-time. Materials planning, purchasing, stockroom and shop floor control systems are supported through a computerized manufacturing resource planning system, which provides customers with the ability to continuously monitor material availability and track work-in-process on a real-time basis. In addition, manufacturing processes are supported by a computerized statistical process control system, whereby customers can remotely access our computer systems to monitor real-time yields, inventory positions, work-in-process status and vendor quality data. \n\n&#8226; Electronic Supply Chain Management. We make available to our customers and suppliers an electronic commerce system/electronic data interchange and web-based tools to implement a variety of supply chain management programs. Our customers use these tools to share demand and product forecasts and deliver purchase orders, and we use these tools with our suppliers for just-in-time delivery, supplier-managed inventory and consigned supplier-managed inventory. \n\nOur Design Services \n\nWe offer a wide spectrum of value-add design services to enhance our relationships with current customers and to help develop relationships with our new customers. Our teams are strategically staffed to support Jabil customers for all development projects, including turnkey system design and design for manufacturing activities. These design services include: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; Electronic Design.

These services have been used by our customers for a variety of products including smart phones and accessory products, notebook and personal computers, connected consumer products and appliances, servers, radio frequency products, optical communications products, communication and broadband products, and automotive and healthcare components and devices. \n\n&#8226; Industrial Design. Our Industrial Design team designs the &#8220;look and feel&#8221; of the plastic and metal enclosures that house the products&#8217; electro-mechanics, including the printed circuit board assemblies (&#8220;PCBA&#8221;). \n\n&#8226; Mechanical Design. Our Mechanical Design team specializes in three-dimensional mechanical design with the analysis of electronic, electro-mechanical and optical assemblies using state of the art modeling and analytical tools. This team has extended Jabil&#8217;s product design offering capabilities to include all aspects of industrial design, advance mechanism development and tooling management. \n\n&#8226; Computer-Assisted Design. Our Computer-Assisted Design (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) team provides PCBA design services using advanced CAD engineering tools, PCBA design validation and verification services, and other consulting services, which include generating a bill of materials, approved vendor list and assembly equipment configuration for a particular PCBA design. We believe that our CAD services result in PCBA designs that are optimized for manufacturability and cost efficiencies and accelerate a product&#8217;s time-to-market and time-to-volume production. \n\n&#8226; Product Validation. Our Product Validation team provides complete product and process validation. This includes product system tests, product safety, regulatory compliance and reliability tests. \n\n&#8226; Manufacturing Test Solution Development. Our Manufacturing Test Solution Development team provides integral support to the design teams to embed design with testability and to promote efficient capital and resource investment \n\nin the manufacturing process. The use of software driven instrumentation and test process design and management has enhanced our product quality and reduced our operating costs relative to human dependent test processes. The full electronic test data-log of customer products has allowed customer product test traceability and visibility throughout the manufacturing test process. \n\nFabrication and Assembly \n\nWe offer systems assembly, test, direct-order fulfillment and configure-to-order services to our customers. Our systems assembly services extend our range of assembly activities to include assembly of higher-level sub-systems and systems incorporating multiple PCBAs. In addition, based on quality assurance programs developed with our customers, we provide testing services for our PCBAs, sub-systems and systems products. Our quality assurance programs include circuit testing under various environmental conditions to ensure that our products meet or exceed required customer specifications. We also offer direct-order fulfillment and configure-to-order services for delivery of final products. \n\nTechnology and Research and Development \n\nWe believe that our manufacturing and testing technologies are among the most advanced in our industry. To meet our customers&#8217; increasingly sophisticated needs, we continuously engage in R&#38;D activities designed to create new and improved products and manufacturing solutions for our customers. Through our R&#38;D efforts, we intend to continue to offer our customers highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing process technologies for precise and aesthetic mechanical components and system assembly. These technologies and R&#38;D activities include: \n\n&#8226; Automation, including automated tooling \n\n&#8226; Electronic interconnection \n\n&#8226; Advanced polymer and metal material science \n\n&#8226; Single/multi-shot injection molding, stamping and in-mold labeling \n\n&#8226; Multi-axis computer numerical control \n\n&#8226; Vacuum metallization \n\n&#8226; Physical vapor deposition \n\n&#8226; Digital printing \n\n&#8226; Anodization \n\n&#8226; Thermal-plastic composite formation \n\n&#8226; Plastic with embedded electronics \n\n&#8226; Metal and plastic covers with insert-molded or dies-casting features for assembly \n\n&#8226; Display cover with integrated touch sensor \n\n&#8226; Material processing research (including plastics, metal, glass and ceramic) \n\n&#8226; Additive manufacturing \n\nWe engage in R&#38;D activities for many products including mobile internet devices and associated accessories, multi-media tablets, two-way radios, health care and life science products, server and storage products, set-top and digital home products and printing products. \n\nCustomers and Marketing \n\nA key tenet of our strategy is to establish and maintain long-term relationships with leading companies in expanding industries with the size and growth characteristics that can benefit from highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing on a global scale. A small number of customers and significant industry sectors have historically comprised a major portion of our net revenue. We also market our services and solutions through our website and our Blue Sky Innovation Centers. \n\nIn fiscal year 2022, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our net revenue and 79 customers accounted for approximately 90% o f our net revenue. The table below sets forth the respective portion of net revenue attributable to the customer that accounted for a significant concentration of our net revenue during the periods indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Apple, Inc. 19 % 22 % 20 % ##TABLE_END\n\nCompetition \n\nOur business is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing service providers, diversified manufacturing service providers and design providers. We also face competition from the manufacturing \n\noperations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. \n\nWe compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the manufacturing services market are: cost; accelerated production time-to-market; higher efficiencies; global locations; rapid scale production; advanced technologies; quality; and improved pricing of components. We believe we are extremely competitive with regard to all of these factors. \n\nComponents Procurement \n\nWe procure components from a broad group of suppliers, determined on an assembly-by-assembly basis. Our global sourcing and purchasing locations are strategically placed in various countries throughout the world along with our global commodity management and supplier relationship teams. These locations manage our end-to-end procurement lifecycle. This regionalized expertise along with our supplier relationships provide efficient procurement operations. \n\nSome of the products we manufacture contain one or more components that are only available from a single source. Some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages. In some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. \n\nProprietary Rights \n\nWe regard certain aspects of our technology, design, production and product management services as proprietary intellectual property. To protect our trade secrets, manufacturing know-how and other proprietary rights, we rely largely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements with our customers, employees, and suppliers and our internal security systems, policies and procedures. We currently have a relatively modest number of patents for various innovations. We believe that our research and design activities, along with developments relating thereto, may result in growth of our patent portfolio and its importance to us, particularly as we expand our business activities. Other factors significant to our proprietary rights include the knowledge and experience of our management and workforce and our ability to develop, enhance and market our technology and services. \n\nWe license some technology and intellectual property rights from third parties. Generally, the license agreements that govern such third-party technology and intellectual property rights grant us the right to use the subject technology anywhere in the world and terminate upon a material breach by us. \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nAs of August 31, 2022, our workforce includes diverse, talented and dedicated employees across approximately 100 locations in more than 30 countries who differentiate us from our competitors. To maintain our edge, we continually invest in our employees, so that they can take care of our customers, shareholders and communities. Following is a summary of employees by location (in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START Region Number of Employees Asia 182 Americas 51 Europe 17 Total (1) \n\n250 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Total headcount includes permanent, temporary and contingent workers. \n\nNone of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by works councils. We have not experienced a significant work stoppage or strike and promote positive employee relations. \n\nSafety \n\n&#8220;Safety First&#8221; is a fundamental value that is ingrained in our culture. We are committed to safety standards in all of our facilities, ensuring our employees are protected and can return home safely after each work shift. By implementing a continuous improvement-based Health and Safety Management System including annual training assessments coupled with engaged leaders and employees who prioritize safety above all else, we have established a path to safety excellence. \n\nCOVID-19 Response \n\nAs a global employer, we have a responsibility to our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities in which we operate to take decisive action to protect against COVID-19 in our facilities. From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we established prevention protocols, which allowed our sites to operate safely with minimal disruption. Quarantine and contact tracing protocols have been established for suspected and/or confirmed cases, and a robust follow-up process has been implemented to ensure the well-being of our employees. \n\nHuman Rights \n\nWe promote respect for fundamental human rights as an essential element of responsible corporate citizenship. We are a founding member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), which is one of the world&#8217;s largest industry coalitions for corporate social responsibility in global supply chains. The RBA sets (1) standards regarding excessive working hours and unfair wages, (2) controls to prohibit child labor and human trafficking, and (3) avenues for employees to raise and address workplace health and safety concerns. We have aligned our work programs, processes and procedures to the RBA Code of Conduct to ensure working conditions are safe, employees are treated with respect and dignity and manufacturing process and practices are environmentally responsible. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\nAt Jabil, our workforce is diverse at its core, and our employees thrive in an entrepreneurial culture where they can do their best work. Diverse backgrounds, experiences and opinions are welcome. We work together in a way that enables our employees to be their true selves, challenges them and encourages them, while allowing them to make a difference at work and in the world. \n\nWe act in accordance with our Code of Conduct to create an environment free from discrimination or harassment globally and respect the human rights of our employees. Moreover, we strive to achieve an inclusive and equitable workplace where opportunities for success are created and available for all employees. To achieve this, we provide training to our leaders on unconscious bias, and in fiscal year 2022, we deployed additional diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) learning with input from our DEI Council, which includes management and nonmanagement members. \n\nJabil is committed to being a place where everyone is psychologically and physically safe to be authentically themselves. With our enterprise-wide priorities of mitigating bias, inclusive leadership and diverse talent development, we are committed to creating a culture of belonging. \n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we launched multiple new initiatives to support a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace for all. We launched a Transgender Inclusive Workplace campaign, which included transgender guidelines; a sample plan for employees, their managers and human resources; a self-paced learning on LGBTQ+; and content regarding gender pronoun usage internally. \n\nWe are proud of being a top scorer for Disability:IN's Disability Equality Index in 2022, the second year in a row. Sites around the world have increased their disability inclusion efforts, including teams who have provided sign language courses for employees, conducted assessments on their facilities for accessibility and partnered with nonprofits in their communities to recruit people with disabilities. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nJabil&#8217;s compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with Jabil&#8217;s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. Specifically: \n\n&#8226; We provide employee pay levels that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. \n\n&#8226; Salary increases and incentive compensation are based on merit and performance. \n\n&#8226; All full-time U.S. employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. Benefits outside the U.S. are provided based upon country-specific practices and are intended to support the health and well-being of our employees and their families. \n\n&#8226; Supporting the mental health and emotional well-being of our employees and their families is a high priority at Jabil, and we have implemented several programs and benefits over the past several years to help de-stigmatize mental health issues and assist employees in finding and leveraging appropriate resources. These include a global employee assistance program (EAP), on-site behavioral health resources in some locations and education for our leaders on ways to recognize and respond to signs of mental health and substance abuse issues. By focusing on training leaders in mental health awareness, we are creating the right environment for mental health issues to be recognized and addressed. Additionally, our Health and Wellbeing programs help to strengthen mental health resilience. \n\n&#8226; The majority of our employees around the world are eligible to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase plan, allowing them to become owners of Jabil stock at a discount. \n\nCareer Growth and Development \n\nAt Jabil, we have historically invested in the professional and personal growth and development of our employees at all levels of the organization to ensure continuous learning and skills enrichment. In addition, we undertake talent reviews to assess bench strength and succession planning. During these reviews, we also spotlight high potential talent, retention rates and the diversity composition of our leaders. In fiscal year 2022, there were more than 37,000 internal promotions at various levels in Jabil, a testament to our ability to grow and develop our own talent. \n\nEmployee Engagement \n\nIn May 2021, we conducted a global Voice of the Employee Survey, utilizing a third party to administer it. Action plans have been developed and are in the process of being executed at all sites. In 2022, we conducted Voice of the Employee Pulse Surveys to measure the impact of these action plans and develop new plans accordingly to promote continued excellence in employee engagement at Jabil. \n\nCultural Initiatives \n\nOur commitment to our employees&#8217; safety and wellbeing goes beyond physical health to include social, emotional and mental health. In October 2021, we announced that all global full-time employees receive (2) wellness and (1) community service paid time off (PTO) days each year. To date, more than 82,000 employees have utilized their wellness days, and 7,000 employees have completed a paid day of community service. \n\nWe have also made a commitment to serve our communities, and in September 2021 we pledged to complete one million volunteer hours in 2022. As of August 31, 2022, Jabil employees and sites have volunteered approximately 500,000 hours in their local communities to help make a difference in the areas of education, empowerment and the environment. \n\nIn June 2022, Jabil&#8217;s multi-year partnership with the Special Olympics USA Games culminated in more than 200 employees volunteering their time throughout the week of the games. These efforts, combined with the efforts of Jabil experts (in areas of IT, procurement, logistics and sustainability) who worked behind the scenes with the Special Olympics over a two year period, helped to make the USA Games a success. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process, those governing worker health and safety, those requiring design changes, supply chain investigation or conformity assessments or those relating to the recycling or reuse of products we manufacture. \n\nInformation about our Executive Officers \n\nExecutive officers are appointed by the Board of Directors and serve at the discretion of the Board.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nBusiness and Operational Risks \n\nOur ability to schedule production, manage capital expenditures and maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity is highly dependent on the actions of our customers, who generally do not commit to long-term production schedules, and may cancel orders, change production quantities, delay production or change sourcing strategy. \n\nMost of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter. We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules and locations, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity and supply chain capabilities. \n\nMany factors outside of our control impact our customers and their ordering behavior, including global pandemics, recession in end markets, changing technology and industry standards, commercial acceptance for products and shifting market demand, product obsolescence, and loss of business. Customers have canceled their orders, changed production quantities or designs, delayed production, changed their sourcing strategy and terminated their relationships with us. We cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their service arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce, cancel or delay the amount of services ordered. Such changes, delays and cancellations have led to, and may lead in the future to a decline in our production and our possession of excess or obsolete inventory that we may not be able to sell to customers or third parties. This may result in write downs of inventories, reduction in the number of products that we sell, delays in payment for inventory that we purchased, and reductions in the use of our manufacturing facilities. As many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand, particularly a reduction in demand for a product that represents a significant amount of revenue, can harm our gross profit margins and results of operations. In the past, we have also been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet anticipated demand. On occasion, customers have required rapid increases in production for one or more of their products or requested that we relocate our manufacturing operations or transfer manufacturing from one facility to another, which stresses our resources and may reduce operating margins. \n\nOur business at times experiences periods of rapid growth which can place considerable demands upon our management team and our operational, financial and management information systems. Our ability to manage growth effectively requires us to continue to implement and improve these systems; avoid cost overruns; maintain customer, supplier and other favorable business relationships during transition periods; efficiently and effectively dedicate resources to existing customers as well as new projects; acquire or construct additional facilities; occasionally transfer operations to different facilities; acquire equipment in anticipation of demand; procure materials and components; continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; adapt relatively quickly to new markets or technologies and continue to hire, train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to effectively manage growth, as well as our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the actions we take to try to manage our growth, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nIn addition, we sometimes experience difficulty forecasting the timing of our receipt of payment from customers. The necessary process to begin manufacturing can be lengthy. Because we may make capital expenditures during this ramping-up process and do not receive payment until after we produce and ship the customer&#8217;s products, any delays or unanticipated costs in the ramping-up process may have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows and our results of operations. Servicing our largest customers may also require us to increase our capital expenditures. \n\nThe effect of COVID-19 on our operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers has had, and may in the future again have, a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur global operations expose us to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our employees, operations, supply chain and distribution system. While we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. To date, COVID-19 has increased our expenses, primarily related to additional labor costs and the procurement of personal protection equipment for our employees globally, and has caused a reduction in factory utilization due to travel disruptions and restrictions. \n\nCOVID-19 continues to spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity, including our global manufacturing production sites. Public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and quarantines, have and are impacting our operations, including affecting the ability of our employees to get to our facilities, reducing capacity utilization levels, causing certain facility or intermittent business closures, and interrupting the movement or increasing the cost of moving components and products through our supply chain. If additional factory closures are required or reductions in capacity utilization levels occur, we expect to incur additional direct costs and lost revenue. \n\nOur suppliers have experienced facility closures or reductions in their capacity utilization levels, which in some cases are ongoing. Our suppliers may experience closures or reductions again in the future. When this occurs we have and may in the future again have difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill production requirements which could lead to higher material and freight costs. \n\nCOVID-19 has also impacted our customers and creates unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for our manufacturing services. \n\nOur ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. The ability of our employees to work has been, and may again be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees, these measures are not always successful and we have been required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures. In addition, responding to the continuing pandemic diverts management&#8217;s attention from our key strategic priorities, and may cause us to reduce, delay, alter or abandon initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value or otherwise disrupt our business operations. While we are staying in close communication with our sites, employees, customers, suppliers and logistics partners and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, the duration and extent of the effect of COVID-19 on Jabil is not determinable. We believe COVID-19 has had, and may in the future again have, a material and adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate the other risks we face. \n\nBecause we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of those customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue. \n\nWe currently depend, and expect to continue to depend for the foreseeable future, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their continued existence, growth, viability and financial stability. See &#8220;Business &#8211; The Company.&#8221; In some instances, particular manufacturing services we provide for a customer represent a significant portion of the overall revenue we receive from that customer. As a result of this concentration, a reduction in business from one or more of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or otherwise become unable to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\nEfficient component and material purchasing is critical to our manufacturing processes and contractual arrangements. A shortage of components or an increase in price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profit, increase our inventory carrying costs, increase our risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence and cause us to purchase components of a lesser quality. \n\nStrategic and efficient component and materials purchasing is an aspect of our strategy. Inflation rates have increased and may continue to rise. Our suppliers have raised their prices and may continue to raise prices. When prices rise, they impact our margins and results of operations if we are not able to pass the increases through to our customers or otherwise offset them. Most of our significant long-term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic prospective adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors; however, we could bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re-pricings or, if such re-pricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to purchase the components and materials needed to manufacture customer products at favorable prices. Accordingly, certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins and results of operations. \n\nSome of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are only available from a single source. Some of these components are subject to supply shortages from time to time. In some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. A supply shortage can also increase our cost of goods sold if we have to pay higher prices for components in limited supply, or cause us to have to redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate a substitute component. In the past there have been industry wide conditions, natural disasters and global events that have caused material and component shortages and shortages from the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing. In fiscal year 2022, our supply chain was impacted by component shortages, most notably in the semiconductor industry. Our production of a customer&#8217;s product has and could again be negatively impacted by any quality, reliability or availability issues with any of our component suppliers. The financial condition of our suppliers could affect their ability to supply us with components and their ability to satisfy any warranty obligations they may have, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nIf a component shortage is threatened or anticipated, we may purchase such components early to avoid a delay or interruption in our operations. Purchasing components early may cause us to incur additional inventory carrying costs and may cause us to experience inventory obsolescence, both of which may not be recoverable from our customers and could adversely affect our \n\ngross profit margins and results of operations. A component shortage will require us to look to second tier vendors or to procure components through brokers. These components may be of lesser quality than those we have historically purchased and could cause us to incur costs to bring such components up to our quality levels or to replace defective ones. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Business &#8211; Components Procurement.&#8221; \n\nCustomer relationships with emerging companies present more risks than with established companies. \n\nCustomer relationships with emerging companies present special risks because we do not have an extensive product or customer relationship history. There is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products making it harder for us to anticipate requirements than with established customers. Our credit risk on these customers, especially in trade accounts receivable and inventories, and the risk that these customers will be unable to fulfill indemnification obligations to us are potentially increased. We sometimes offer these customers extended payment terms, loans and other support and financial accommodations which increases our financial exposure and has impacted our financial results in the past. \n\nThe success of our business is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and competitive conditions in our industry, and our ability to effectively adapt our services as our customers react to technological changes and competitive conditions in their respective industries. \n\nIf we are unable to offer technologically advanced, cost effective, quick response manufacturing services that are differentiated from our competition and adapt those services as our customers&#8217; requirements change, demand for our services will decline. \n\nIntroducing new business models or programs requiring implementation of new competencies, such as new process technologies and our development of new products or services, could affect our operations and financial results. \n\nThe introduction of new business models or programs requiring implementation or development of new competencies, such as new process technology within our operations and our independent development of new products or services, presents challenges in addition to opportunities. The success of new business models or programs depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, a sufficient understanding of the new business or markets, timely and successful product development (by us and/or our customer), market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new business models or programs and new product production ramp-up, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, our development or acquisition of appropriate intellectual property, the availability of supplies in adequate quantities and at appropriate costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, we cannot determine in advance the ultimate result of new business models or programs. \n\nAs a result, we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our assumptions will accurately reflect customer demand. After the development of a new business model, program, product or service, we typically must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low cost. To accomplish this, we endeavor to accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations; however, we do not always succeed at doing so. \n\nWe compete with numerous other diversified manufacturing service providers, electronic manufacturing services, design providers and others. \n\nOur business is highly competitive and our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturers, manufacturing service providers, design providers and others. The significant purchasing power and market power of these competitors, many of which are large companies, could increase pricing and competitive pressures for us. Most of our competitors have international operations and significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing, research and development (R&#38;D) and marketing resources. These competitors may: \n\n&#8226; respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements; \n\n&#8226; have technological expertise, engineering capabilities and/or manufacturing resources that are greater than ours; \n\n&#8226; have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic market presence; \n\n&#8226; be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities; \n\n&#8226; devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services and execution of their strategy; \n\n&#8226; be better positioned to compete on price for their services; \n\n&#8226; have excess capacity, and be better able to utilize such excess capacity; \n\n&#8226; have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers; \n\n&#8226; have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide; \n\n&#8226; be willing or able to make sales or provide services at lower margins than we do; \n\n&#8226; have increased vertical capabilities providing them greater cost savings. \n\nWe also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. In the past, some of our customers moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. \n\nThe actions of competitors and current and potential customers have and could cause a decline in our sales and/or compression of our profits. \n\nOur business could be adversely affected by any delays, or increased costs, resulting from common carrier or transportation issues. \n\nWe rely on a variety of common carriers across the globe to transport our materials from our suppliers and to our customers. Problems suffered by any of these common carriers, including natural disaster, pandemic, labor problems, increased energy prices, or criminal activity, could result in shipping delays for products or materials, increased costs or other supply chain disruptions, and could therefore have a negative impact on our ability to receive products from suppliers and deliver products to customers, resulting in a material adverse effect on our operations. \n\nWe may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise. \n\nMany of the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to: \n\n&#8226; hire, retain and expand our pool of qualified engineering and technical personnel; \n\n&#8226; maintain and continually improve our technological expertise; \n\n&#8226; develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs; and \n\n&#8226; anticipate and respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis. \n\nAlthough we use the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment and the offering of new or additional services to our customers may require significant expense or capital investment, which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results. In facilities that we newly establish or acquire, we may not be able to insert or maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise. Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers&#8217; changing technological needs and requirements or to hire sufficient personnel to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe depend on attracting and retaining officers, managers and skilled personnel. \n\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our officers, managers and skilled personnel. These employees are not generally bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain them. To aid in managing our growth and strengthening our pool of management and skilled personnel, we will need to internally develop, recruit and retain skilled management personnel. If we are not able to do so, our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed. \n\nWe derive a substantial majority of our revenues from our international operations, which are subject to a number of different risks and often require more management time and expense than our domestic operations. \n\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: \n\n&#8226; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and attempting to ensure compliance with our policies, procedures, and applicable local laws; \n\n&#8226; less flexible employee relationships that can be difficult and expensive to terminate due to, among other things, labor laws and regulations; \n\n&#8226; rising labor costs (including the introduction or expansion of certain social programs), in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate, due to, among other things, demographic changes and economic development in those regions; \n\n&#8226; labor unrest and dissatisfaction, including potential labor strikes or claims; \n\n&#8226; increased scrutiny by the media and other third parties of labor practices within our industry (including working conditions, compliance with employment and labor laws and compensation) which may result in allegations of violations, more stringent and burdensome labor laws and regulations, higher labor costs and/or loss of revenues if our customers become dissatisfied with our labor practices and diminish or terminate their relationship with us; \n\n&#8226; burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, domestic and foreign import and export controls, trade barriers (including tariffs and quotas), environmental policies and privacy issues, and local statutory corporate governance rules; \n\n&#8226; risk of non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;) or similar regulations in other jurisdictions; \n\n&#8226; less favorable, less predictable, or relatively undefined, intellectual property laws; \n\n&#8226; lack of sufficient or available locations from which to operate or inability to renew leases on terms that are acceptable to us or at all; \n\n&#8226; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws or government or judicial interpretations of such regulatory requirements and laws and adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; \n\n&#8226; adverse changes in tax rates or accounting rules and the manner in which the U.S. and other countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws or accounting rules or restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S.; \n\n&#8226; limitations on imports or exports of components or products, or other trade sanctions; \n\n&#8226; political and economic instability and unsafe working conditions; \n\n&#8226; geopolitical unrest, including the invasion of Ukraine, the possibility of military activity in countries near or adjacent to Ukraine, and the sanctions and other actions taken by the European Union, the United States, and other governments around the world in response; \n\n&#8226; risk of governmental expropriation of our property; \n\n&#8226; inadequate infrastructure for our operations (e.g., lack of adequate power, water, transportation and raw materials); \n\n&#8226; legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices; \n\n&#8226; health concerns, epidemics and related government actions; \n\n&#8226; increased travel costs and difficulty in coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones; \n\n&#8226; longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting trade accounts receivable; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; \n\n&#8226; economies that are emerging or developing or that are subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks; \n\n&#8226; higher potential for theft, misappropriation or unauthorized access to or use of technology, data or intellectual property; and \n\n&#8226; international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect our business. Tariffs could increase the costs of the components and raw materials we use in the manufacturing process as well as import and export costs for finished products. Countries could adopt other protectionist measures that could limit our ability to manufacture products or provide services. Increased costs to our U.S. customers who use our non-U.S. manufacturing sites and components may adversely impact demand for our services and our results of operation and financial condition. Additionally, international trade disputes may cause our customers to decide to relocate the manufacturing of their products to another location, either within country, or into a new country. Relocations may require considerable management time as well as expenses related to market, personnel and facilities development before any significant revenue is generated, which may negatively affect our margin. Furthermore, there can be no \n\nassurance that all customer manufacturing needs can be met in available locations within the desired timeframe, or at all, which may cause us to lose business, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation. \n\nIn particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing, design, support and storage operations are conducted in our facilities in China, and revenues associated with our China operations are important to our success. Therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by economic, political, legal, regulatory, competitive, infrastructure and other factors in China. International trade disputes or political differences with China could result in tariffs and other measures that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement and control over economic growth. In addition, our operations in China are governed by Chinese laws, rules and regulations, some of which are relatively new. The Chinese legal system continues to rapidly evolve, which may result in uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws, rules and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. China experiences high turnover of direct labor in the manufacturing sector due to the intensely competitive and fluid market for labor, and the retention of adequate labor is a challenge. If our labor turnover rates are higher than we expect, or we otherwise fail to adequately manage our labor needs, then our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We are also subject to risks associated with our subsidiaries organized in China. For example, regulatory and registration requirements and government approvals affect the financing that we can provide to our subsidiaries. If we fail to receive required registrations and approvals to fund our subsidiaries organized in China, or if our ability to remit currency out of China is limited, then our business and liquidity could be adversely affected. \n\nThese factors may harm our results of operations. Also, any measures that we may implement to reduce risks of our international operations may not be effective, may increase our expenses and may require significant management time and effort. Entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start-up expenses related to market, personnel and facilities development before any significant revenue is generated. As a result, initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable. \n\nAlthough we have implemented policies and procedures designed to cause compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. \n\nEnergy price increases or shortages may negatively impact our results of operations. \n\nCertain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our facilities and transportation activities. An increase in energy prices, which have been volatile historically, or energy shortages or restrictions could cause disruption in our operations and/or increase in our raw material costs and transportation costs. In addition, increased transportation costs of certain of our suppliers and customers could be passed along to us. We may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. In addition, any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability. \n\nWe have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions. \n\nWe have in the past and will continue to seek and complete acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify future strategic acquisitions and adequately conduct due diligence, consummate these potential acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, or if consummated, successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve significant risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us including: \n\n&#8226; Financial risks, such as: (1) overpayment; (2) an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements; (3) exposure to liabilities of the acquired businesses, with contractually-based time and monetary limitations on a seller&#8217;s obligation to indemnify us; (4) integration costs or failure to achieve synergy targets; (5) incurrence of additional debt; (6) valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; (7) possible adverse tax and accounting effects; (8) the risk that we acquire manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue; (9) the risk that, in the future, we may have to close or sell acquired facilities at our cost, which may include substantial employee severance costs and asset write-offs, which have resulted, and may result, in our incurring significant losses; and (10) costs associated with environmental risks including fines, remediation and clean-up. \n\n&#8226; Operating risks, such as: (1) the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources to the integration of the acquired businesses and their employees and to the management of expanding operations; (2) the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; (3) the need to implement \n\nfinancial and other systems and add management resources; (4) the need to maintain customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and restructure or terminate unfavorable relationships; (5) the potential for deficiencies in internal controls of the acquired operations; (6) the inability to attract and retain the employees necessary to support the acquired businesses; (7) potential inexperience in a line of business that is either new to us or that has become materially more significant to us as a result of the transaction; (8) unforeseen difficulties (including any unanticipated liabilities) in the acquired operations; (9) the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur; (10) the possibility that the acquired business&#8217;s past transactions or practices before our acquisition may lead to future commercial or regulatory risks; (11) the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image; (12) the possibility that we will have unutilized capacity due to our acquisition activity; (13) when acquiring an operation from a customer and continuing or entering into a supply arrangement, our inability to meet the expectations of the customer as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions. \n\nAlthough we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of due diligence regarding the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses. Until we actually assume operating control of such businesses and their assets and operations, we may not be able to ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired entities and their operations. \n\nMost of our acquisitions involve operations outside of the U.S., which are subject to various risks including those described in &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense than our domestic operations.&#8221; \n\nWe have acquired and may continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from our customers (or potential customers). In these acquisitions, the divesting company will typically enter into a supply arrangement with the acquirer. Therefore, our competitors often also pursue these acquisitions. In addition, certain divesting companies may choose not to offer to sell their operations to us because of our current supply arrangements with other companies or may require terms and conditions that may impact our profitability. If we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities at favorable terms, our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted. \n\nWe face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations. \n\nIn recent years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings. These initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities, largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand. The process of restructuring entails, among other activities, moving production between facilities, transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies, closing facilities, reducing the level of staff, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management. \n\nRestructurings could adversely affect us, including a decrease in employee morale, delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the restructurings, failure to achieve targeted cost savings, and failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the restructuring process. These risks are further complicated by our extensive international operations, which subject us to different legal and regulatory requirements that govern the extent and speed of our ability to reduce our manufacturing capacity and workforce. \n\nAny delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs. \n\nWe are currently in the process of completing the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in certain of our manufacturing facilities, which will replace the existing planning and financial information systems. Any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences, including disruption of operations, loss of information and unanticipated increases in costs. \n\nDisruptions to our information systems, including security breaches, losses of data or outages, and other security issues, could adversely affect our operations. \n\nWe rely on information systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to store, process and transmit confidential information, including financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and electronic communications, belonging to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and/or us. We attempt to monitor and mitigate our exposure to cybersecurity issues and modify our systems when warranted and we have implemented certain business continuity items including data backups at alternative sites. Nevertheless, these systems are vulnerable to, and at times have suffered from, among other things, damage from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunication services, physical and electronic loss of data, terrorist attacks, security breaches, phishing, cyberattacks and computer viruses. We regularly face attempts by others to access our information systems in an unauthorized manner, to introduce malicious software to such systems or both. The increased use of mobile technologies and the internet of things can \n\nheighten these and other operational risks. If we, or the third parties who own and operate certain of our information systems, are unable to prevent such breaches, losses of data and outages, our operations could be disrupted. Also, the time and funds spent on monitoring and mitigating our exposure and responding to breaches, including the training of employees, the purchase of protective technologies and the hiring of additional employees and consultants to assist in these efforts could adversely affect our financial results. The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate the threat landscape and new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. There can be no assurance that the security measures and systems configurations we choose to implement will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. Any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, negative reactions from current and potential future customers (including potential negative financial ramifications under certain customer contract provisions) and poor publicity and any of these could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulations intended to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere. Compliance with these regulations can be costly and any failure to comply could result in legal and reputational risks as well as penalties, fines and damages that could adversely affect our financial results. \n\nRegulatory Risks \n\nWe are subject to extensive government regulations and industry standards and the terms of complex contracts; a failure to comply with current and future regulations and standards, or the terms of our contractual arrangements, could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. \n\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards relating to the products we design and manufacture as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support, privacy and data protection, the regulations that apply to government contracts, and many other facets of our operations. The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods. Failure or noncompliance with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations. In addition, we regularly enter into a large number of complex contractual arrangements as well as operate pursuant to the terms of a significant number of ongoing intricate contractual arrangements. Our failure or our customers&#8217; failure to comply with the terms of such arrangements could expose us to claims or other demands and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations. \n\nIf we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our services may decline, our reputation may be damaged and we may be subject to liability claims. \n\nOur customers&#8217; products and the manufacturing processes and design services that we use to produce them often are highly complex. Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, have occurred and may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. The failure of the products that we manufacture or of our manufacturing processes or facilities may subject us to regulatory enforcement, fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down, temporarily halt operations or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility. In addition, these defects have, and may in the future result in liability claims against us, expose us to liability to pay for the recall or remanufacture of a product or adversely affect product sales or our reputation. Even if our customers are responsible for the defects or defective specifications, they may not, or may not have resources to, assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects, which could expose us to additional liability claims. Any of these actions could increase our expenses, reduce our revenue or damage our reputation as a supplier to these customers. \n\nWe may face heightened liability risks specific to our medical device business as a result of additional healthcare regulatory related compliance requirements and the potential severe consequences (e.g., death or serious injury) that could result from manufacturing defects or malfunctions of the medical devices we manufacture or design. \n\nAs a service provider engaged in the business of designing and manufacturing medical devices for our customers, we have compliance requirements in addition to those relating to other industries we serve within our business. We are required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;), including current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). This regulation establishes requirements for manufacturers of medical devices to implement design and process manufacturing controls, quality control, labeling, handling and documentation procedures. The FDA, through periodic inspections and post-market surveillance, continuously and rigorously monitors compliance with these QSR requirements and other applicable \n\nregulatory requirements. If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance, and we do not address the FDA&#8217;s concerns to its satisfaction, the FDA may elect to take enforcement action against us, including issuing inspection observations or a notice of violation or a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility or temporarily halting operations at or shutting down a manufacturing facility. \n\nBeyond the FDA, our medical device business is also subject to applicable state and foreign regulatory requirements. Within the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), we are required to fulfill certain internationally recognized standards and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain certifications to these standards. Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers. In China, the National Medical Products Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products. We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted. In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products. These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits. Other foreign countries where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing. In the event of any noncompliance with these requirements, interruption of our operations and/or ability to allow commerce in these markets could occur, which in turn could cause our reputation and business to suffer. \n\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws or regulations could cause us significant expense. \n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws and regulations, including those arising from global pandemics or relating to the use, generation, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process, those governing worker health and safety, those requiring design changes, supply chain investigation or conformity assessments and those relating to the recycling or reuse of products we manufacture. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations or timely obtain any needed permits, we could become subject to liabilities, and we could face fines or penalties, the suspension of production, or prohibitions on sales of products we manufacture. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product or with changes in our operational, procurement and inventory management activities. \n\nCertain environmental laws impose liability for the costs of investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on an owner, occupier or operator of real estate, or on parties who arranged for hazardous substance treatment or disposal, even if such person or company was unaware of, or not responsible for, contamination at the affected site. Soil and groundwater contamination may have occurred at or near, or may have arisen from, some of our facilities. From time to time we investigate, remediate and monitor soil and groundwater contamination at certain of our operating sites. In certain instances where contamination existed prior to our ownership or occupation of a site, landlords or former owners have retained some contractual responsibility for contamination and remediation. However, failure of such persons to perform those obligations could result in us being required to address such contamination. As a result, we may incur clean-up costs in such potential removal or remediation efforts. In other instances, we may be responsible for clean-up costs and other liabilities, including the possibility of claims due to health risks by both employees and non-employees, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites. \n\nIn addition, there is an increasing governmental focus around the world on global warming and environmental impact issues, which has resulted in new environmental, health and safety regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition. \n\nWe have limited insurance coverage for potential environmental liabilities associated with current operations and we do not anticipate increasing such coverage in the future. \n\nOur operations result in exposure to intellectual property claims. \n\nOur operations expose us to intellectual property rights claims from third parties, some of whom may hold key intellectual property rights in areas in which we operate. Intellectual property clearance or licensing efforts or activities, if any, may be inadequate to anticipate and avoid intellectual property claims. Our customers or suppliers, or their customers or suppliers, could also become subject to intellectual property claims. \n\nEven though many, but not all, of our contracts require others to indemnify Jabil for intellectual property claims relating to their products, designs or technology, any such party may not, or may not have the resources to, assume responsibility for such claims. We may be responsible for claims that our services, designs, technologies, products, or components, equipment or \n\nprocesses we supply or use, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third party intellectual property rights. Providing turnkey design solutions, designs, technologies, products and other services may expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face providing traditional manufacturing services. These liabilities may include an increase in exposure to claims that products we design or supply, or processes, materials or components we use, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third-party intellectual property rights. Customers for our products and services in which we provide significant design or technology contributions sometimes require that we indemnify them against risk of intellectual property claims. \n\nIf any intellectual property claims are brought, regardless of their merits, we could be required to expend significant resources in the defense or settlement of such claims, or in the defense or settlement of related indemnification claims. Intellectual property rights claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, potential injunctive action, or hamper our normal operations such as by interfering with the availability of components or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In the event of such a claim, we may spend significant amounts of money and effort to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain and maintain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining and maintaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all. We, or suppliers or customers, may be required to or decide to discontinue products or services, and such discontinuance may result in a significant decrease in our business and/or could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. These risks may be heightened in connection with our customer relationships with emerging companies. \n\nThe success of certain aspects of our business depends in part on our ability to obtain, protect and leverage intellectual property rights. \n\nIn certain circumstances, we strive to obtain and protect certain intellectual property rights related to solutions, designs, processes and products that we create. We believe that obtaining a significant level of protected proprietary technology may give us a competitive advantage. In addition to selectively relying on patent rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including non-disclosure agreements, with our customers, employees and suppliers and our internal security systems, policies and procedures to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, we cannot be certain the measures we employ will result in protected intellectual property rights or will result in the prevention of unauthorized use of our technology. If we are unable to obtain and protect intellectual property rights embodied within our solutions, designs, processes and products, this could reduce or eliminate competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. \n\nEven if we take steps to protect certain intellectual property rights, these mechanisms may not afford complete or sufficient protection, and misappropriation or unauthorized use may still occur. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire or enforce our patent or other rights, if any, and that others will not independently develop similar know-how and trade secrets, or develop better solutions, designs, processes and products than us. We have not historically sought patent protection for many of our proprietary processes, designs or other patentable intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to prevent current or former customers, employees, contractors and other parties from breaching non-disclosure agreements and misappropriating proprietary information. If any of the foregoing occur, it could impair our ability to compete, result in a significant decrease in our business and/or could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nExposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results. \n\nWe provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty. When customers experience financial difficulty, we have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, and demand for our products from these customers sometimes declines. Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty sourcing supplies necessary to fulfill production requirements. When one or more of our customers becomes insolvent or otherwise is unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition are adversely affected. Such adverse effects have included and may in the future include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory writeoffs, an impairment of contract assets, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding. In addition, because we securitize certain of our accounts receivable, our securitization programs could be negatively affected by customer financial difficulty affecting the recovery of a significant amount of receivables. \n\nWhen financial markets experience significant turmoil, the financial arrangements we may need to enter into, refinance or repay and our customers may be adversely affected. \n\nCredit market turmoil could negatively impact the counterparties and lenders to our forward foreign exchange contracts, trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs, unsecured credit and term loan facilities, commercial paper program, various foreign subsidiary credit facilities and other debt facilities. These potential negative impacts could limit our ability to borrow under these financing agreements, contracts, facilities and programs or renew or obtain future additional financing. Credit market turmoil could also negatively impact certain of our customers and certain of their respective customers, which could cause them to reduce or cancel their orders and have a negative effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe can offer no assurance under the uncommitted trade accounts receivable sales programs that if we attempt to sell receivables through such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks, which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities. \n\nWe are subject to the risk of increased taxes. \n\nWe base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law (including adverse changes to the manner in which the U.S. and other countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws). We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. In addition, our effective tax rate may be increased by changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our cash management strategies, changes in local tax rates or countries adopting more aggressive interpretations of tax laws, or other legislative changes. \n\nSeveral countries in which we are located allow for tax incentives to attract and retain business. We have obtained incentives where available and practicable. Our taxes could increase if certain tax incentives are retracted, which could occur if we are unable to satisfy the conditions on which such incentives are based, if they are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions otherwise increase. Due to the possibility of changes in existing tax law and our operations, we are unable to predict how any expirations will impact us in the future. In addition, acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase, depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located. \n\nCertain of our subsidiaries provide financing, products and services to, and undertake certain significant transactions with, other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. Several jurisdictions in which we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules that require that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arm&#8217;s length pricing principles, and that contemporaneous documentation must exist to support such pricing. There is a risk that the taxing authorities may not deem our transfer pricing methodology or documentation acceptable. \n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), along with the G20, issued an inclusive framework in October 2021 on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting which may result in legislative changes that could reshape international tax rules, including the introduction of a global minimum tax. Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted if these provisions are adopted. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impacts of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. \n\nOur credit rating may be downgraded. \n\nOur credit is and certain of our financial instruments and our commercial paper are rated by credit rating agencies. Any potential future negative change in our credit ratings may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our common stock; increase our interest payments under existing debt agreements; cause us to lose the ability to utilize our commercial paper program; and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the interest rate payable under the Credit Facility (as such terms are define d in Note 7 &#8211; &#8220;Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements) is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change. Thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on the Credit Facility and certain of our other borrowings. \n\nOur amount of debt could significantly increase in the future. \n\nThe Company has a number of debt facilities. Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; a nd Note 7 &#8211; &#8220;Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. \n\nShould we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities, undertake significant additional expansion activities, or make substantial investments in our infrastructure or in support of customer opportunities, our capital needs would increase and could result in our need to increase borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. An increase in the level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: \n\n&#8226; make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for other acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; \n\n&#8226; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business; \n\n&#8226; make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and \n\n&#8226; impact certain financial covenants that we are subject to in connection with our debt and asset-backed securitization programs. \n\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future debt service obligations. \n\nAn adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition. \n\nWe pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and certain other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. An adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined has and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If certain economic or fiscal issues occur, interest rates could rise, which would increase our interest costs and reduce our net income. Also, increased interest rates could make any future fixed interest rate debt obligations more expensive. \n\nWe are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations. \n\nAlthough a significant number of our operations are located outside the United States, the majority of our business is conducted in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates will affect our net revenue, cost of sales, operating margins and net income. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations. We use financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that our hedging activities enable us to largely protect ourselves from future exchange rate fluctuations. If, however, these hedging activities are not successful, if the counterparties to these hedging activities default on their obligations to us or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, certain countries in which we operate have adopted, or may adopt, currency controls requiring that local transactions be settled only in local currency. Such controls could require us to hedge larger amounts of local currency than we have in the past. \n\nAn impairment in the value of our assets would reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs. \n\nWe have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. We perform a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. Refer t o note 6 to the consolidated financial statements f or further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of our businesses and we could be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact our consolidated balance sheet, as well as our consolidated statement of operations. \n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\nChanges in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations. \n\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions that are completed before a change is announced. Changes to those rules or questions as to how we interpret or implement them may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. For example, significant changes to revenue recognition rules have been adopted and first applied to us in fiscal year 2019. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, climate change and global events. \n\nOur operations and those of our customers and suppliers have been and may again be subject to natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemics or other business disruptions, which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses. We are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes (including in Florida, \n\nwhere our headquarters are located), earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water or other natural resource shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, drought, fire, extreme weather conditions, rising sea level, geopolitical events such as direct or indirect terrorist acts or acts of war, other natural or manmade disasters, boycotts and sanctions or widespread criminal activities. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or to deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business globally or in certain regions. While we maintain similar manufacturing capacities at different locations and coordinate multi-source supplier programs on many of our materials, which we believe better enables us to respond to these types of events, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. Our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. \n\nWhile we manufacture our products in a large number of diversified facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster or otherwise, whether short- or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on us. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nOverview \n\nWe are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. We derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as &#8220;manufacturing services&#8221;), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer. \n\nWe have two reporting segments: Electronics Manufacturing Services (&#8220;EMS&#8221;) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (&#8220;DMS&#8221;), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. Our EMS segment is focused around leveraging IT, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. Our EMS segment is a high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the 5G, wireless and cloud, digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap, and networking and storage industries. Our DMS segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, technologies and healthcare. Our DMS segment includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, connected devices, healthcare and packaging, and mobility industries. \n\nOur cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. As a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. This requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. At times, we collect deposits from our customers related to the purchase of inventory in order to effectively manage our working capital. Although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, our ability to purchase components and materials efficiently may contribute significantly to our operating results. While we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers, rising component and material prices may negatively affect our margins. Net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. Our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. \n\nOur operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. During periods of low production volume, we generally have reduced operating income margins. \n\nWe monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can try to respond appropriately as circumstances change. \n\nWe have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. To support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. Most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. In addition, our engineers engage in research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. The expenses of these R&#38;D activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nAn important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. The majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the U.S. are denominated in local currencies. We economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. \n\nSee Note 13 &#8211; &#8220;Concentration of Risk and Segment Data&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCOVID-19 \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began to impact us in January 2020, has continued to affect our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. Travel and business operation restrictions arising from virus containment efforts of governments around the world have continued to impact our operations in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Essential activity exceptions from these restrictions have allowed us to continue to operate but virus containment efforts have resulted in additional direct costs. \n\nThe impact on our suppliers has led to supply chain constraints, including difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill customer production requirements and challenges in transporting completed products to our end customers. \n\nSummary of Results \n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain key operating results and other financial information (in millions, except per share data): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Net revenue $ 33,478 $ 29,285 $ 27,266 Gross profit $ 2,632 $ 2,359 $ 1,931 Operating income $ 1,393 $ 1,055 $ 500 Net income attributable to Jabil Inc. $ 996 $ 696 $ 54 Earnings per share &#8211; basic $ 7.06 $ 4.69 $ 0.36 Earnings per share &#8211; diluted $ 6.90 $ 4.58 $ 0.35 ##TABLE_END\n\nKey Performance Indicators \n\nManagement regularly reviews financial and non-financial performance indicators to assess the Company&#8217;s operating results. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements, which are dependent on the effective management of our sales cycle as well as timing of payments. Our sales cycle measures how quickly we can convert our manufacturing services into cash through sales. We believe the metrics set forth below are useful to investors in measuring our liquidity as future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. \n\nThe following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of management&#8217;s key financial performance indicators: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Three Months Ended August 31, 2022 May 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 \n\nSales cycle (1) \n\n32 days 37 days 19 days \n\nInventory turns (annualized) (2) \n\n5 turns 4 turns 5 turns \n\nDays in accounts receivable (3) \n\n40 days 35 days 38 days \n\nDays in inventory (4) \n\n79 days 85 days 71 days \n\nDays in accounts payable (5) \n\n87 days 83 days 90 days ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators. \n\n(2) Inventory turns (annualized) are calculated as 360 days divided by days in inventory. \n\n(3) Days in accounts receivable is calculated as accounts receivable, net, divided by net revenue multiplied by 90 days. During the three months ended August 31, 2022, the increase in days in accounts receivable from the three months ended May 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by higher sales and the timing of collections. \n\n(4) Days in inventory is calculated as inventory and contract assets divided by cost of revenue multiplied by 90 days. During the three months ended August 31, 2022, the increase in days in inventory from the three months ended August 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher raw material balances due to supply-chain constraints and to support expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended August 31, 2022, the decrease in days in inventory from the prior sequential quarter was primarily driven by increased sales activity during the quarter. \n\n(5) Days in accounts payable is calculated as accounts payable divided by cost of revenue multiplied by 90 days. During the three months ended August 31, 2022, the decrease in days in accounts payable from the three months ended August 31, 2021 was primarily due to timing of purchases and cash payments during the quarter. During the three months \n\nended August 31, 2022, the increase in days in accounts payable from the three months ended May 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in materials purchases and timing of payments. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 &#8211; &#8220;Des cription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nFor our over time customers, we believe the measure of progress which best depicts the transfer of control is based on costs incurred to date, relative to total estimated cost at completion (i.e., an input method). This method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services because it results in the recognition of revenue on the basis of our to-date efforts in the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected efforts in the satisfaction of the performance obligation. We believe that the use of an input method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. The transaction price of each performance obligation is generally based upon the contractual stand-alone selling price of the product or service. \n\nInventory Valuation \n\nWe purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost and net realizable value considerations. If actual market conditions or our customers&#8217; product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. \n\nLong-Lived Assets \n\nWe have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. Estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill. We review amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. \n\nWe perform a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or if the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a loss is recognized in the amount equal to that excess. \n\nWe perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible is impaired. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or if the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible exceeds the carrying value, the recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired. \n\nWe completed our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. The qualitative assessment was used for all reporting units and we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment analysis. ##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; criteria. We assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. For further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to Note 15 &#8212; &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nS ee Note 19 &#8211; &#8220;New Accounting Guidance&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nRefer to Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year en ded August 31, 2021 for the results of operations discussion for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 . \n\nNet Revenue \n\nGenerally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. Accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. In addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure. \n\nThe distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Net revenue $ 33,478 $ 29,285 $ 27,266 14.3 % 7.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nNet revenue increased during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. Specifically, the EMS segment net revenue increased 20% due to: (i) a 9% increase in revenues from existing customers within our 5G, wireless and cloud business, (ii) a 5% increase in revenues from existing customers within our digital print and retail business, (iii) a 4% increase in revenues from existing customers within our industrial and capital equipment business and (iv) a 2% increase in revenues from existing customer within our networking and storage business. The DMS segment net revenue increased 9% due to: (i) a 6% increase in revenues from existing customers within our automotive and transportation business, (ii) a 3% increase in revenues from existing customers within our healthcare and packaging businesses and (iii) a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our connected devices business. The increase was partially offset by a 2% decrease in revenues from existing customers within our mobility business. \n\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we expect an additional $500 million in components that we procure and integrate for our cloud business will shift from a purchase and resale model to a customer-controlled consignment service model. As a result of this continued transition, revenue associated with these components are shown on a net basis and as a result, we expect higher gross margins and lower cash used in this business. \n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 EMS 50 % 47 % 52 % DMS 50 % 53 % 48 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, foreign source revenue expressed as a percentage of net revenue: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2022 2021 2020 Foreign source revenue 83.9 % 83.6 % 82.6 % ##TABLE_END\n\nGross Profit \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Gross profit $ 2,632 $ 2,359 $ 1,931 Percent of net revenue 7.9 % 8.1 % 7.1 % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, primarily due to product mix. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Selling, general and administrative \n\n$ 1,154 $ 1,213 $ 1,175 $ (59) $ 38 ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to (i) a $39 million decrease due to lower salary and salary related expenses and (ii) a $21 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to higher anticipated achievement levels for certain performance-based stock awards during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and certain one-time awards granted during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. \n\nResearch and Development \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Research and development $ 33 $ 34 $ 43 Percent of net revenue 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nResearch and development expenses remained consistent as a percent of net revenue during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. \n\nAmortization of Intangibles \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Amortization of intangibles $ 34 $ 47 $ 56 $ (13) $ (9) ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nAmortization of intangibles decreased during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 primarily driven by reduced amortization related to the Nypro trade name. \n\nRestructuring, Severance and Related Charges ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nFollowing is a summary of our restructuring, severance and related charges: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160;(in millions) 2022 (1) \n\n2021 2020 Employee severance and benefit costs $ 18 $ 5 $ 94 Lease costs &#8212; (1) 8 Asset write-off costs &#8212; 5 33 Other costs &#8212; 1 22 Total restructuring, severance and related charges (2) \n\n$ 18 $ 10 $ 157 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Recorded during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 for headcount reduction activities. \n\n(2) Includes $1 million and $0 million recorded in the EMS segment, $10 million and $9 million recorded in the DMS segment and $7 million and $1 million of non-allocated charges for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring, severance and related charges are cash costs. \n\nSe e Note 14 &#8211; &#8220;Restructuring, Severance and Related Charges&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of restructuring, severance and related charges. \n\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Loss on debt extinguishment $ 4 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 4 $ &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nLoss on debt extinguishment is due to the &#8220;make-whole&#8221; premium incurred during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, for the redemption of the 4.700% Senior Notes due 2022. \n\n(Gain) Loss on Securities \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 (Gain) loss on securities $ &#8212; $ (2) $ 49 $ 2 $ (51) ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nThe change in (gain) loss on securities during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, is due to cash proceeds received in connection with the sale of an investment during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. \n\nOther Expense (Income) \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Other expense (income) $ 12 $ (11) $ 31 $ 23 $ (42) ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nThe change in other expense (income) during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, is primarily due to: (i) $10 million related to an increase in fees associated with higher utilization of the trade accounts receivable sales programs, (ii) $7 million primarily related to higher net periodic benefit costs, and (iii) $6 million arising from an increase in other expense. \n\nInterest Income \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Interest income $ 5 $ 6 $ 15 $ (1) $ (9) ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nInterest income remained relatively consistent during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. \n\nInterest Expense \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Interest expense $ 151 $ 130 $ 174 $ 21 $ (44) ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nInterest expense increased during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, primarily due to higher interest rates and higher borrowings on our credit facilities and commercial paper program. Additionally, the increase is due to higher borrowings on our senior notes. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Effective income tax rate 19.1 % 26.0 % 78.2 % (6.9) % (52.2) % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 vs. 2021 \n\nThe effective income tax rate decreased for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, primarily due to: (i) higher income before income tax in low tax rate jurisdictions and decreased losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 and (ii) an income tax benefit of $26 million for the reversal of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. These decreases were partially offset by a $17 million income tax expense for an unrecognized tax benefit related to the taxation of certain prior year intercompany transactions for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. \n\nNon-GAAP (Core) Financial Measures \n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our &#8220;core&#8221; financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our &#8220;core&#8221; financial measures. \n\nManagement believes that the non-GAAP &#8220;core&#8221; financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring, severance and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, loss on debt extinguishment, (gain) loss on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP &#8220;core&#8221; financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation. \n\nWe determine the tax effect of the items excluded from &#8220;core&#8221; earnings and &#8220;core&#8221; diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to \n\nrealize a tax benefit (due to existing tax incentives or a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a reduced or 0% tax rate is applied. \n\nWe are reporting &#8220;core&#8221; operating income, &#8220;core&#8221; earnings and cash flows to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our &#8220;core&#8221; manufacturing operations. A significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating &#8220;core&#8221; operating income and &#8220;core&#8221; earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. In the case of restructuring, severance and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. In addition, although, for purposes of calculating &#8220;core&#8221; operating income and &#8220;core&#8221; earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders&#8217; ownership interest. We encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nAdjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net capital expenditures (acquisition of property, plant and equipment less proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment). We report adjusted free cash flow as we believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in measuring our ability to generate cash internally and fund future growth and to provide a return to shareholders. \n\nIncluded in the tables below are a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements: \n\nRefer to Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 for the non-GAAP financial measures discussion for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. \n\nReconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Results to Non-GAAP Measures ##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, (in millions, except for per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Operating income (U.S. GAAP) $ 1,393 $ 1,055 $ 500 Amortization of intangibles 34 47 56 Stock-based compensation expense and related charges 81 102 83 \n\nRestructuring, severance and related charges (1) \n\n18 10 157 Distressed customer charge &#8212; &#8212; 15 \n\nNet periodic benefit cost (2) \n\n17 24 16 Business interruption and impairment charges, net &#8212; (1) 6 Acquisition and integration charges &#8212; 4 31 Adjustments to operating income 150 186 364 Core operating income (Non-GAAP) $ 1,543 $ 1,241 $ 864 Net income attributable to Jabil Inc.

In the opinion of management, this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere, and all necessary adjustments (consisting primarily of normal recurring accruals) have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. \n\n##TABLE_START Three Months Ended (in millions, except for per share data) August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Net revenue $ 9,030 $ 7,409 Gross profit $ 729 $ 587 Operating income $ 409 $ 265 Net income $ 315 $ 175 Net income attributable to Jabil Inc. $ 315 $ 175 Earnings per share attributable to the stockholders of Jabil Inc.: Basic $ 2.30 $ 1.20 Diluted $ 2.25 $ 1.16 ##TABLE_END\n\nAcquisitions and Expansion \n\nRefe r to Note 16 &#8211; &#8220;Business Acquisitions&#8221; to th e Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nWe believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, additional proceeds available under our global asset-backed securitization program and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash flows provided by operating activities and access to the capital markets will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, any share repurchases under the approved program, any potential acquisitions, our working capital requirements and our contractual obligations for the next 12 months and beyond. We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nAs of August 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which a significant portion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Most of our foreign cash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2022 could be repatriated to the United States without potential tax expense. \n\nNotes Payable and Credit Facilities \n\nFollowing is a summary of principal debt payments and debt issuance for our notes payable and credit facilities: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 4.700% \n\nSenior \n\nNotes (1) \n\n4.900% Senior Notes 3.950% Senior Notes 3.600% Senior Notes 3.000% Senior Notes 1.700% Senior Notes 4.250% Senior Notes (1) \n\nBorrowings \n\nunder \n\nrevolving \n\ncredit \n\nfacilities (2) \n\nBorrowings under loans Total notes payable and credit facilities Balance as of August 31, 2020 $ 499 $ 299 $ 495 $ 495 $ 590 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 350 $ 2,728 Borrowings &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 500 &#8212; 1,224 &#8212; 1,724 Payments &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; (1,224) (350) (1,574) Other &#8212; 1 1 &#8212; 1 (4) &#8212; &#8212; 1 &#8212; Balance as of August 31, 2021 499 300 496 495 591 496 &#8212; &#8212; 1 2,878 Borrowings &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 498 3,269 &#8212; 3,767 Payments (500) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; (3,269) (1) (3,770) Other 1 &#8212; 1 1 1 1 (5) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Balance as of August 31, 2022 $ &#8212; $ 300 $ 497 $ 496 $ 592 $ 497 $ 493 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 2,875 Maturity Date Sep 15, 2022 Jul 14, 2023 Jan 12, 2028 Jan 15, 2030 Jan 15, 2031 Apr 15, 2026 May 15, 2027 Jan 22, 2024 and Jan 22, 2026 Jul 31, 2026 \n\nOriginal Facility/ Maximum Capacity (2) \n\n$500 million $300 million $500 million $500 million $600 million $500 million $500 million $3.8 billion (2) \n\n$2 million ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) On May 4, 2022, we issued $500 million of registered 4.250% Senior Notes due 2027 (the &#8220;Green Bonds&#8221; or the &#8220;4.250% Senior Notes&#8221;). On May 31, 2022, the net proceeds from the offering were used to redeem our 4.700% Senior Notes due in 2022 and pay the applicable &#8220;make-whole&#8221; premium and accrued interest. In addition, we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to finance or refinance eligible expenditures under our new green financing framework. \n\n(2) As of August 31, 2022, we had $3.8 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. The Credit Facility acts as the back-up facility for commercial paper outstanding, if any. We have a borrowing capacity of up to $3.2 billion under our commercial paper program, which was increased from $1.8 billion on February 18, 2022. Commercial paper borrowings with an original maturity of 90 days or less are recorded net within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and have been excluded from the table above. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have letters of credit and surety bonds with banks and insurance companies outstanding of $73 million as of August 31, 2022. Unused letters of credit were $77 million as of August 31, 2022. Letters of credit and surety bonds are generally available for draw down in the event we do not perform. \n\nWe have a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources. \n\nOur Senior Notes and our credit facilities contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. Refer to Note 7 &#8211; &#8220;Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. \n\nAsset-Backed Securitization Programs \n\nGlobal asset-backed securitization program - Effective August 20, 2021, the global asset-backed securitization program (formerly referred to as the North American asset-backed securitization program) terms were amended to: (i) add a foreign entity to the program, (ii) increase the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available at any one time from $390 million to $600 million and (iii) extend the expiration date of the program to November 25, 2024. \n\nIn connection with our asset-backed securitization program, during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, we sold $3.9 billion of trade accounts receivable and we received cash proceeds of $3.9 billion. As of August 31, 2022, we had no available liquidity under our global asset-backed securitization program. \n\nCertain entities participating in the global asset-backed securitization program continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis. In addition, the foreign entity participating in the global asset-backed securitization program sells certain receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a daily basis. \n\nThe special purpose entity in the global asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain unsold receivables covering up to the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the domestic, or U.S., portion of our global asset-backed securitization program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of August 31, 2022. \n\nForeign asset-backed securitization program - We terminated the foreign asset-backed securitization program on June 28, 2021. In connection with the termination, we paid approximately $167 million in cash, which consisted of: (i) $68 million for the remittance of collections received prior to June 28, 2021, in our role as servicer of sold receivables and (ii) a repurchase of $99 million of all previously sold receivables, at fair value, that remained outstanding as of June 28, 2021. As of August 31, 2021, we had substantially collected the repurchased receivables from customers. \n\nGlobal and foreign asset-backed securitization programs - We continue servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receive a servicing fee under the global asset-backed securitization program. Servicing fees related to each of the asset-backed securitization programs recognized during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material. We do not record a servicing asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we estimate that the fee received to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities. \n\nRefer to Note 8 &#8211; &#8220;Asset-Backed Securitization Programs&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the programs. \n\nTrade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs \n\nFollowing is a summary of the trade accounts receivable sale programs with unaffiliated financial institutions. Under the programs we may elect to sell receivables and the unaffiliated financial institutions may elect to purchase, at a discount, on an ongoing basis (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Program Maximum Amount (1) \n\nType of Facility Expiration Date A $ 700 Uncommitted December 5, 2022 (2) B $ 150 Uncommitted November 30, 2022 C 400 CNY Uncommitted August 31, 2023 D $ 150 Uncommitted May 4, 2023 (3) E $ 150 Uncommitted January 25, 2023 (3) F $ 50 Uncommitted February 23, 2023 (4) G $ 100 Uncommitted August 10, 2023 (3) H $ 550 Uncommitted December 4, 2022 (5) I $ 135 Uncommitted April 11, 2023 (6) J 100 CHF Uncommitted December 5, 2022 (2) K $ 65 Uncommitted January 23, 2023 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Maximum amount of trade accounts receivable that may be sold under a facility at any one time. \n\n(2) The program will be automatically extended through December 5, 2025 unless either party provides 30 days notice of termination. \n\n(3) Any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior notice. \n\n(4) Any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. \n\n(5) The program will be automatically extended through December 5, 2024 unless either party provides 30 days notice of termination. \n\n(6) The program will be automatically extended through April 11, 2025 unless either party provides 30 days notice of termination. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, we sold $8.5 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $8.5 billion. As of August 31, 2022, we had up to $1.6 billion in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs. \n\nCash Flows \n\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated cash flow information (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,651 $ 1,433 $ 1,257 Net cash used in investing activities (858) (851) (921) Net cash used in financing activities (888) (413) (65) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 6 4 (40) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (89) $ 173 $ 231 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 was primarily due to increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, non-cash expenses and net income, partially offset by increased inventories, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets and contract assets. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments. The increase in inventories is primarily due to higher raw material balances due to supply chain constraints and to support expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 . The increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by higher sales and the timing of collections. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily driven by the timing of payments. The increase in contract assets is primarily due to the timing of billings to our customers. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 consisted primarily of capital expenditures principally to support ongoing business in the DMS and EMS segments, partially offset by proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock, (iii) dividend payments, and (iv) treasury stock minimum tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock. Net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by (i) borrowings under debt agreements and (ii) net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nFor Fiscal Year 2023, we anticipate our net capital expenditures will be approximately $875 million. In general, our capital expenditures support ongoing maintenance in our DMS and EMS segments and investments in capabilities and targeted end markets. The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. \n\nDividends and Share Repurchases \n\nFollowing is a summary of the dividends and share repurchases for the fiscal years indicated below (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Dividends Paid (1) \n\nShare Repurchases (2) \n\nTotal \n\nFiscal years 2016 &#8211; 2020 \n\n$ 283 $ 1,468 $ 1,751 Fiscal year 2021 $ 50 $ 428 $ 478 Fiscal year 2022 $ 48 $ 696 $ 744 Total $ 381 $ 2,592 $ 2,973 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The difference between dividends declared and dividends paid is due to dividend equivalents for unvested restricted stock units that are paid at the time the awards vest. \n\n(2) Excludes commissions. \n\nWe currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our Board of Directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance and global economic conditions. \n\nIn July 2021, the Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock (the &#8220;2022 Share Repurchase Program&#8221;). As of August 31, 2022, 12.4 million shares had been repurchased for $737 million and $263 million remains available under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. \n\nIn September 2022, the Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock (the &#8220;2023 Share Repurchase Program&#8221;). \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur contractual obligations as of August 31, 2022 are summarized below. As disclosed below, while we have certain non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment, we generally do not enter into non-cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. Non-cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks, at most. Purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancellable. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Payments due by period (in millions) &#160; Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Notes payable and long-term debt $ 2,875 $ 300 $ &#8212; $ 990 $ 1,585 Future interest on notes payable and long-term debt (1) \n\n535 98 171 154 112 \n\nOperating lease obligations (2) \n\n587 130 180 103 174 \n\nFinance lease obligations (2)(3) \n\n338 126 109 89 14 \n\nNon-cancelable purchase order obligations (4) \n\n759 539 187 33 &#8212; \n\nPension and postretirement contributions and payments (5) \n\n51 27 4 5 15 \n\nOther (6) \n\n51 25 16 10 &#8212; \n\nTotal contractual obligations (7) \n\n$ 5,196 $ 1,245 $ 667 $ 1,384 $ 1,900 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Consists of interest on notes payable and long-term debt outstanding as of August 31, 2022. Certain of our notes payable and long-term debt pay interest at variable rates. We have applied estimated interest rates to determine the value of these expected future interest payments. \n\n(2) Excludes $78 million of payments related to leases signed but not yet commenced. Additionally, certain leases signed but not yet commenced contain residual value guarantees and purchase options not deemed probable. \n\n(3) Excludes $194 million of residual value guarantees that could potentially come due in future periods. The Company does not believe it is probable that any amounts will be owed under these guarantees. Therefore, no amounts related to the residual value guarantees are included in the lease payments used to measure the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. \n\n(4) Consists of purchase commitments entered into as of August 31, 2022 primarily for property, plant and equipment and software pursuant to legally enforceable and binding agreements. \n\n(5) Includes the estimated company contributions to funded pension plans during fiscal year 2023 and the expected benefit payments for unfunded pension and postretirement plans from fiscal years 2023 through 2032. These future payments are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets but will be recorded as incurred. \n\n(6) Includes (i) a $19 million capital commitment, (ii) a $5 million obligation related to a human resource system and (iii) $27 million related to the one-time transition tax as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that will be paid in annual installments through fiscal year 2026. \n\n(7) As of August 31, 2022, we have $7 million and $158 million recorded as a current and a long-term liability, respectively, for uncertain tax positions. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments, or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time, and accordingly, this liability has been excluded from the above table. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risks \n\nWe transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, intercompany transactions and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. We do not, and do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their respective fair values. \n\nThe forward contracts (both those that are designated and not designated as accounting hedging instruments) will generally expire in less than three months, with 11 months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding as of August 31, 2022. The change in fair value related to contracts designated as accounting hedging instruments is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to the revenue or expense line in which the underlying transaction occurs within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The change in fair value related to contracts not designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in cost of revenue within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The forward contracts are primarily denominated in Chinese yuan renminbi, Euro, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Swiss franc. \n\nBased on our overall currency rate exposures as of August 31, 2022, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, an immediate 10% hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 11 &#8212; &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nOur exposure to market risk includes changes in interest rates that could affect the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on intra-quarter variable rate borrowings under the Credit Facility and our commercial paper program. There were no borrowings outstanding under debt facilities with variable interest rates as of August 31, 2022. \n\nWe utilize valuation models to estimate the effects of sudden interest rate changes. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in the interest rates under the Credit Facility and our commercial paper program would increase our interest expense as of August 31, 2022 by approximately $18 million . See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; and Note 7 &#8212; &#8220;Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations. \n\nTo manage our exposure to market risk, we use derivative financial instruments and hybrid instruments when deemed appropriate. In connection with our anticipated debt issuance, we have interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of $150 million and $100 million, which expire on July 31, 2024. See Note 11 &#8212; &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our interest rate swap transactions. We do not, and do not intend to, use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 9A. Controls and Procedures \n\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nWe carried out an evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act (the &#8220;Evaluation&#8221;), under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act as of August 31, 2022. Based on the Evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\n(b) Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022. Management&#8217;s report on internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022 is incorporated herein at Item 15. Ernst &#38; Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, which is incorporated herein at Item 15. \n\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. \n\nThe design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have reached the conclusions set forth in Management&#8217;s report on internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022. \n\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nFor our fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2022, we did not identify any modifications to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n"

(the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company&#8217;s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022. Management based this assessment on the framework as established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management&#8217;s assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBased on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of August 31, 2022, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. \n\nErnst &#38; Young LLP, the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm, issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting which follows this report. \n\nOctober 25, 2022 \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Jabil Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Jabil Inc. and subsidiaries&#8217; internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Jabil Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a), and our report dated October 25, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n##TABLE_START /s/ ERNST &#38; YOUNG LLP ##TABLE_END\n\nTampa, Florida \n\nOctober 25, 2022 \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Jabil Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jabil Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at August 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated October 25, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n##TABLE_START Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter \n\nAs disclosed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in a complex multinational tax environment and is subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding intercompany transactions. Uncertain tax positions may arise from interpretations and judgments made by the Company in the application of the relevant laws, regulations, and tax rulings. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether the technical merits of tax positions for certain intercompany transactions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measuring the related amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. \n\nAuditing the tax positions related to certain intercompany transactions was challenging because the recognition and measurement of the tax positions is highly judgmental and is based on interpretations of laws, regulations and tax rulings. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe tested internal controls over the Company&#8217;s process to assess the technical merits of tax positions related to certain intercompany transactions and also tested internal controls over the Company&#8217;s process to determine the application of the relevant laws, regulations and tax rulings, including management&#8217;s process to recognize and measure the related tax positions. \n\nIn testing the recognition and measurement criteria, we involved tax professionals to assist in assessing the technical merits of the Company&#8217;s tax positions. In addition, we used our knowledge of and experience with the application of domestic and international income tax laws by the relevant tax authorities to evaluate the Company&#8217;s accounting for those tax positions. We also assessed the Company&#8217;s assumptions and data used to measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition and tested the clerical accuracy of the calculations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nJabil Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, herein referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is one of the leading providers of manufacturing services and solutions. The Company provides comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. The Company&#8217;s services combine a highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing approach with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability technologies. The Company is headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida and has manufacturing operations principally in the Americas, Europe and Asia. \n\nSignificant accounting policies followed by the Company are as follows: \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company, and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Company has made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior periods&#8217; Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to the current presentation. \n\nUse of Accounting Estimates \n\nManagement is required to make estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash equivalents consist of investments that are readily convertible to cash with original maturities of 90 days or less. \n\nAccounts Receivable \n\nAccounts receivable consist of trade receivables and other miscellaneous receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses based on historical losses, the age of past due receivables, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Bad debts are charged to this allowance after all attempts to collect the balance are exhausted. As the financial condition and circumstances of the Company&#8217;s customers change, adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made as necessary. \n\nContract Balances \n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records an asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing a customer (&#8220;contract assets&#8221;) while a liability is recognized when a customer provides consideration prior to the Company transferring control of the goods or services (&#8220;contract liabilities&#8221;). Amounts recognized as contract assets are generally transferred to receivables in the succeeding quarter due to the short-term nature of the manufacturing cycle. Contract assets are classified separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and transferred to receivables when right to payment becomes unconditional. \n\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses related to contract assets based on historical losses, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from our customers. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis) and net realizable value. Inventory is valued based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost and net realizable value considerations. If actual market conditions or customer product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. \n\nFulfillment Costs \n\nThe Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill its contracts that i) relate directly to the contract or anticipated contracts, ii) are expected to generate or enhance the Company&#8217;s resources that will be used to satisfy the performance obligation under the \n\ncontract, and iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated from the contract. Capitalized fulfillment costs are amortized to cost of revenue as the Company satisfies the related performance obligations under the contract with approximate lives ranging from 1 year to 3 years. These costs, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, generally represent upfront costs incurred to prepare for manufacturing activities. \n\nThe Company assesses the capitalized fulfillment costs for impairment at the end of each reporting period. The Company will recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the capitalized costs exceeds the recoverable amount. Recoverability is assessed by considering the capitalized fulfillment costs in relation to the forecasted profitability of the related manufacturing performance obligations. \n\nAs of August 31, 2022 and 2021, capitalized costs to fulfill were $ 175 million and $ 133 million, respectively. Amortization of fulfillment costs were $ 74 million, $ 58 million and $ 57 million during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net \n\nProperty, plant and equipment is capitalized at cost and depreciated using the straight-line depreciation method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Estimated useful lives for major classes of depreciable assets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Asset Class Estimated Useful Life Buildings \n\nUp to 35 years \n\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or useful life of the improvement Machinery and equipment \n\n2 to 10 years \n\nFurniture, fixtures and office equipment 5 years Computer hardware and software \n\n3 to 7 years \n\nTransportation equipment 3 years ##TABLE_END \n\nMaintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of operating income. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed beginning in fiscal year 2020, the Company has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for building and real estate leases. \n\nThe Company primarily has leases for buildings, machinery and equipment with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 34 years. Leases for other classes of assets are not significant. For any leases with an initial term in excess of 12 months, the Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by evaluating if the contract conveys the right to use and control the specific property or equipment. Certain lease agreements contain purchase or renewal options. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Generally, the Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain material restrictive covenants. \n\nRight-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. When determining the present value of future payment, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Any payment deemed probable under residual value guarantees is included in lease payments. Any variable payments, other than those that depend on an index or rate, are excluded from right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. \n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nCertain equipment and buildings held under finance leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and the related obligation is recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of assets held under finance leases is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nThe Company accounts for goodwill in a business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is assigned to the reporting unit in which the acquired business will operate. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. \n\nThe recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or if the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the Company determines the fair value of its reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a loss recognized in the amount equal to that excess. \n\nThe recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. The Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible is impaired. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or if the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible exceeds the carrying value, the Company determines the fair value principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired. \n\nBusiness combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful life and include contractual agreements and customer relationships, tradenames and intellectual property. No significant residual values are estimated for the amortizable intangible assets. \n\nLong-lived Assets \n\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the asset or asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or as the appraised value. \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nAll derivative instruments are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), net of tax, and is subsequently reclassified into the line item within the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized immediately in current earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, gains and losses from changes in fair values are recognized in earnings. Cash receipts and cash payments related to derivative instruments are recorded in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income \n\nThe following table sets forth the changes in AOCI, net of tax, by component during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Derivative Instruments Actuarial Gain (Loss) Prior Service (Cost) Credit Total Balance as of August 31, 2021 $ ( 20 ) $ ( 36 ) $ 51 &#160; $ ( 20 ) $ ( 25 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications ( 68 ) 1 &#160; \n\n28 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 39 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI \n\n&#8212; &#160; 32 &#160; \n\n( 14 ) \n\n4 &#160; 22 &#160; Other comprehensive (loss) income (1) \n\n( 68 ) 33 &#160; 14 &#160; 4 &#160; ( 17 ) Balance as of August 31, 2022 $ ( 88 ) $ ( 3 ) $ 65 &#160; $ ( 16 ) $ ( 42 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts are net of tax, which are immaterial. \n\nThe following table sets forth the amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line item, net of tax, for the periods indicated (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Item 2022 2021 2020 Realized losses (gains) on derivative instruments: (1) \n\nForeign exchange contracts Cost of revenue $ 30 &#160; $ ( 44 ) $ 15 &#160; Interest rate contracts Interest expense 2 &#160; 3 &#160; ( 1 ) Actuarial gain \n\n(2) \n\n( 14 ) ( 16 ) ( 3 ) Prior service cost \n\n(2) \n\n4 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Available for sale securities \n\n(Gain) loss on securities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 36 &#160; \n\nTotal amounts reclassified from AOCI (3) \n\n$ 22 &#160; $ ( 56 ) $ 47 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The Company expects to reclassify $ 28 million into earnings during the next twelve months, which will primarily be classified as a component of cost of revenue. \n\n(2) Amounts are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost. Refer to Note 10 &#8211; &#8220;Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits&#8221; for additional information. \n\n(3) Amounts are net of tax, which are immaterial for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nForeign Currency Transactions \n\nFor the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries that use a currency other than the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, the assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The effects of these translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in operating income. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company provides comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as &#8220;manufacturing services&#8221;), which encompasses the act of producing tangible products that are built to customer specifications, which are then provided to the customer. \n\nThe Company generally enters into manufacturing service contracts with its customers that provide the framework under which business will be conducted and customer purchase orders will be received for specific quantities and with predominantly fixed pricing. As a result, the Company considers its contract with a customer to be the combination of the manufacturing service contract and the purchase order, or any agreements or other similar documents. \n\nThe majority of the Company's manufacturing service contracts relate to manufactured products which have no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the work completed to date. As a result, revenue is recognized over time when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services (known as performance obligations) to its customers. For certain other contracts with customers that do not meet the over time revenue recognition criteria, transfer of control occurs at a point in time which generally occurs upon delivery and transfer of risk and title to the customer. \n\nMost of the Company's contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct and is distinct within the context of the contract. For the majority of customers, performance obligations are satisfied over time based on the continuous transfer of control as manufacturing services are performed and are generally completed in less than one year. \n\nThe Company also derives revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers. Revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized over time as the services are performed. \n\nFor the Company&#8217;s over time customers, it believes the measure of progress which best depicts the transfer of control is based on costs incurred to date, relative to total estimated cost at completion (i.e., an input method). This method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services because it results in the recognition of revenue on the basis of the Company's to-date efforts in the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected efforts in the satisfaction of the performance obligation. The Company believes that the use of an input method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs as the Company incurs costs on its contracts. The transaction price of each performance obligation is generally based upon the contractual stand-alone selling price of the product or service. \n\nCertain contracts with customers include variable consideration, such as periodic cost of materials adjustments, rebates, discounts, or returns. The Company recognizes estimates of this variable consideration that are not expected to result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, primarily based on the most likely level of consideration to be paid to the customer under the specific terms of the underlying programs. \n\nThe Company is responsible for procuring certain components from suppliers for the manufacturing of finished goods at the direction of certain customers. If the Company does not obtain control of these components before they are transferred to the customer, the Company accounts for revenue associated with such components on a net basis. Revenue associated with components procured directly from customers is accounted for on a net basis if the components do not constitute a distinct good or service from the customer. \n\nTaxes collected from the Company&#8217;s customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented within the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Operations on a net basis and are excluded from the transaction price. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. Accordingly, the Company records customer payments of shipping and handling costs as a component of net revenue, and classifies such costs as a component of cost of revenue. \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, reduced for estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period for outstanding stock awards. \n\nThe stock-based compensation expense for time-based and performance-based restricted stock unit awards (&#8220;restricted stock units&#8221;) is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock. For restricted stock units with performance conditions, stock-based compensation expense is originally based on the number of shares that would vest if the Company achieved 100 % of the performance goal, which is the intended outcome at the grant date. Throughout the requisite service period, management monitors the probability of achievement of the performance condition. If it becomes probable, based on the Company&#8217;s performance, that more or less than the current estimate of the awarded shares will vest, an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense will be recognized as a change in accounting estimate in the period that such probability changes. \n\nThe stock-based compensation expense for market-based restricted stock units is measured at fair value on the date of grant. The market conditions are considered in the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo valuation model, which utilizes multiple input variables to determine the probability of the Company achieving the specified market conditions. Stock-based compensation expense related to an award with a market condition will be recognized over the requisite service period regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service period has been completed. \n\nThe Company currently expects to satisfy share-based awards with registered shares available to be issued. \n\nSee Note 12 &#8211; &#8220;Stockholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; for further discussion of stock-based compensation expense. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nDeferred tax assets (&#8220;DTA&#8221;) and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. \n\nThe Company records the effects of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) as a period cost and applies the incremental cash tax savings approach when analyzing the impact GILTI could have on its U.S. valuation allowance. The incremental cash tax savings approach considers the realizable benefit of a net operating loss and deferred tax assets by comparing the incremental cash taxes in the calculation of GILTI with and without the net operating loss and other DTAs. \n\nEarnings Per Share \n\nThe Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to Jabil Inc. by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company&#8217;s diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the effect of dilutive securities. The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock units. \n\nPotential shares of common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share when their effect would be antidilutive. Performance-based restricted stock units are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion have been met assuming the end of the reporting period represents the end of the performance period. All potential shares of common stock are antidilutive in periods of net loss. Potential shares of common stock not included in the computation of earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive or because the performance criterion was not met were as follows (in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Restricted stock units 209.4 &#160; 655.0 &#160; 728.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nFair value is categorized in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used. Level 1 &#8211; quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2 &#8211; inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 &#8211; unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. \n\n2. Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs \n\nThe Company regularly sells designated pools of high credit quality trade accounts receivable under uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs to unaffiliated financial institutions without recourse. As these accounts receivable are sold without recourse, the Company does not retain the associated risks following the transfer of such accounts receivable to the respective financial institutions. The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the trade accounts receivable sale programs. Servicing fees related to each of the trade accounts receivable sale programs recognized during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material. The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities. \n\nTransfers of the receivables under the trade accounts receivable sale programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the trade accounts receivable sale programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nThe following is a summary of the trade accounts receivable sale programs with unaffiliated financial institutions where the Company may elect to sell receivables and the unaffiliated financial institution may elect to purchase, at a discount, on an \n\nongoing basis (in millions): ##TABLE_START Program Maximum Amount (1) \n\nType of Facility Expiration Date A $ 700 &#160; Uncommitted December 5, 2022 (2) B $ 150 &#160; Uncommitted November 30, 2022 C 400 &#160; CNY Uncommitted August 31, 2023 D $ 150 &#160; Uncommitted May 4, 2023 (3) E $ 150 &#160; Uncommitted January 25, 2023 (3) F $ 50 &#160; Uncommitted February 23, 2023 (4) G $ 100 &#160; Uncommitted August 10, 2023 (3) H $ 550 &#160; Uncommitted December 4, 2022 (5) I $ 135 &#160; Uncommitted April 11, 2023 (6) J 100 &#160; CHF Uncommitted December 5, 2022 (2) K $ 65 &#160; Uncommitted January 23, 2023 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Maximum amount of trade accounts receivable that may be sold under a facility at any one time. \n\n(2) The program will be automatically extended through December 5, 2025 unless either party provides 30 days notice of termination. \n\n(3) Any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior notice. \n\n(4) Any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. \n\n(5) The program will be automatically extended through December 5, 2024 unless either party provides 30 days notice of termination. \n\n(6) The program will be automatically extended through April 11, 2025 unless either party provides 30 days notice of termination. \n\nIn connection with the trade accounts receivable sale programs, the Company recognized the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2022 2021 2020 Trade accounts receivable sold $ 8,513 &#160; $ 4,654 &#160; $ 8,457 &#160; Cash proceeds received $ 8,504 &#160; $ 4,651 &#160; $ 8,440 &#160; \n\nPre-tax losses on sale of receivables (1) \n\n$ 9 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 17 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Recorded to other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\n3.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nThe Company completed its annual impairment analysis for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022.

Asset-Backed Securitization Programs \n\nGlobal asset-backed securitization program - Effective August 20, 2021, the global securitization program (formerly referred to as the North American asset-backed securitization program) terms were amended to: (i) add a foreign entity to the program, (ii) increase the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available at any one time from $ 390 million to $ 600 million and (iii) extend the expiration date of the program to November 25, 2024. As of August 31, 2022, the Company had no available liquidity under its global asset-backed securitization program. \n\nCertain entities participating in the global asset-backed securitization program continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis. In addition, the foreign entity participating in the global asset-backed securitization program sells certain receivables at a discount to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a daily basis. \n\nThe special purpose entity in the global asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain unsold receivables covering up to the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the domestic, or U.S., portion of the global asset-backed securitization program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of August 31, 2022. \n\nForeign asset-backed securitization program - The Company terminated the foreign asset-backed securitization program on June 28, 2021. In connection with the termination, the Company paid approximately $ 167 million in cash, which consisted of: (i) $ 68 million for the remittance of collections received prior to June 28, 2021, in the Company&#8217;s role as servicer of sold receivables and (ii) a repurchase of $ 99 million of all previously sold receivables, at fair value, that remained outstanding as of June 28, 2021. As of August 31, 2021, the Company had substantially collected the repurchased receivables from customers. \n\nGlobal and foreign asset-backed securitization programs- The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under the global asset-backed securitization programs. Servicing fees related to each of the asset-backed securitization programs recognized during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material. The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities. \n\nTransfers of the receivables under the asset-backed securitization programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the asset-backed securitization programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nIn connection with the asset-backed securitization programs, the Company recognized the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2022 2021 (3) \n\n2020 Trade accounts receivable sold $ 3,932 &#160; $ 4,222 &#160; $ 4,333 &#160; \n\nCash proceeds received (1) \n\n$ 3,919 &#160; $ 4,202 &#160; $ 4,314 &#160; Proceeds due from bank $ &#8212; &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; \n\nPre-tax losses on sale of receivables (2) \n\n$ 13 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 19 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The amounts primarily represent proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving-period transfers. \n\n(2) Recorded to other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\n(3) Includes trade accounts receivable sold and cash proceeds received under the foreign asset-backed securitization program through June 28, 2021, except for $ 99 million of previously sold receivables that were repurchased. \n\nThe global asset-backed securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including compliance with the interest ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio of the Credit Facility. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the global asset-backed securitization program. As of August 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the foreign asset-backed securitization program. \n\n9. Accrued Expenses \n\nAccrued expenses consist of the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Inventory deposits $ 1,586 &#160; $ 711 &#160; Accrued compensation and employee benefits 806 &#160; 827 &#160; \n\nContract liabilities (1) \n\n796 &#160; 559 &#160; Other accrued expenses 2,084 &#160; 1,637 &#160; Accrued expenses $ 5,272 &#160; $ 3,734 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 that was included in the contract liability balance as of August 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 312 million and $ 365 million, respectively. \n\n10. Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits \n\nPostretirement Benefits \n\nThe Company has a qualified defined benefit pension plan for employees of Jabil Circuit UK Limited (the &#8220;UK plan&#8221;). The UK plan, which is closed to new participants, provides benefits based on average employee earnings over a three-year service period preceding retirement and length of employee service. The Company&#8217;s policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in UK employee benefit and tax laws plus such additional amounts as are deemed appropriate by the Company. \n\nAs a result of the third closing of the Johnson &#38; Johnson Medical Devices Companies (&#8220;JJMD&#8221;) acquisition, the Company assumed a pension obligation for employees in Switzerland (the &#8220;Switzerland plan&#8221;). The Switzerland plan, which is a qualified defined benefit pension plan, provides benefits based on average employee earnings over an approximately 8 year service period preceding retirement and length of employee service. The Company&#8217;s policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in Switzerland employee benefit and tax laws plus such additional amounts as are deemed appropriate by the Company. \n\nAdditionally, as a result of acquiring various other operations in Europe, Asia and Mexico the Company assumed both qualified and unfunded nonqualified retirement benefits covering eligible employees who meet age and service requirements (the &#8220;other plans&#8221;). \n\nThe UK plan, Switzerland plan and other plans are collectively referred to herein as the &#8220;plans.&#8221; \n\nBenefit Obligation and Plan Assets \n\nThe projected benefit obligations (&#8220;PBO&#8221;) and plan assets, changes to the PBO and plan assets and the funded status of the plans as of and for the fiscal years ended August 31 are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Change in PBO Beginning PBO $ 587 &#160; $ 559 &#160; Service cost 25 &#160; 25 &#160; Interest cost 4 &#160; 5 &#160; Actuarial (gain) loss ( 119 ) 2 &#160; \n\nSettlements paid from plan assets (1) \n\n( 28 ) ( 44 ) Total benefits paid ( 13 ) ( 17 ) Plan participants&#8217; contributions 21 &#160; 25 &#160; Plan amendments &#8212; &#160; 24 &#160; Acquisitions &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; Effect of conversion to U.S. dollars ( 45 ) &#8212; &#160; Ending PBO $ 432 &#160; $ 587 &#160; Change in plan assets Beginning fair value of plan assets 576 &#160; 538 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 68 ) 55 &#160; Acquisitions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nSettlements paid from plan assets (1) \n\n( 28 ) ( 44 ) Employer contributions 16 &#160; 17 &#160; Benefits paid from plan assets ( 12 ) ( 15 ) Plan participants&#8217; contributions 21 &#160; 25 &#160; Effect of conversion to U.S. dollars ( 46 ) &#8212; &#160; Ending fair value of plan assets $ 459 &#160; $ 576 &#160; Funded (unfunded) status $ 27 &#160; $ ( 11 ) Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Accrued benefit liability, current $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; Accrued benefit asset, noncurrent $ 28 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Accrued benefit liability, noncurrent $ &#8212; &#160; $ 10 &#160; \n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (2) \n\nActuarial gain, before tax $ ( 85 ) $ ( 69 ) Prior service cost, before tax $ 18 &#160; $ 23 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The settlements recognized during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 relate primarily to the Switzerland plan. \n\n(2) The Company anticipates amortizing $ 14 million and $ 4 million, before tax, of net actuarial gain and prior service costs balances, respectively, to net periodic cost in fiscal year 2023. \n\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation \n\nThe following table summarizes the total accumulated benefit obligations (&#8220;ABO&#8221;), the ABO and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with ABO in excess of plan assets, and the PBO and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with PBO in excess of plan assets for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 ABO $ 417 &#160; $ 563 &#160; Plans with ABO in excess of plan assets ABO $ 41 &#160; $ 59 &#160; Fair value of plan assets $ 19 &#160; $ 26 &#160; Plans with PBO in excess of plan assets PBO $ 51 &#160; $ 74 &#160; Fair value of plan assets $ 19 &#160; $ 26 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost \n\nThe following table provides information about the net periodic benefit cost for the plans for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 \n\nService cost (1) \n\n$ 25 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 25 &#160; \n\nInterest cost (2) \n\n4 &#160; 5 &#160; 3 &#160; \n\nExpected long-term return on plan assets (2) \n\n( 17 ) ( 16 ) ( 15 ) \n\nRecognized actuarial gain (2) \n\n( 6 ) ( 10 ) ( 3 ) \n\nAmortization of actuarial gains (2)(3) \n\n( 8 ) ( 6 ) &#8212; &#160; \n\nNet settlement loss (2) \n\n1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nAmortization of prior service costs (2) \n\n4 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nNet periodic benefit cost \n\n$ 3 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 10 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Service cost is recognized in cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\n(2) Components are recognized in other expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\n(3) Actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a corridor approach. The gain/loss corridor is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Gains and losses in excess of the corridor are generally amortized over the average future working lifetime of the plan participants. \n\nAssumptions \n\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and PBO for the plans for the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Net periodic benefit cost: \n\nExpected long-term return on plan assets (1) \n\n3.0 &#160; % 2.9 &#160; % 3.0 &#160; % Rate of compensation increase 2.2 &#160; % 2.1 &#160; % 2.0 &#160; % Discount rate 0.7 &#160; % 0.8 &#160; % 0.5 &#160; % PBO: Expected long-term return on plan assets 3.6 &#160; % 3.0 &#160; % 2.9 &#160; % Rate of compensation increase 2.1 &#160; % 2.2 &#160; % 2.1 &#160; % \n\nDiscount rate (2) \n\n2.6 &#160; % 0.7 &#160; % 0.8 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The expected return on plan assets assumption used in calculating net periodic benefit cost is based on historical return experience and estimates of future long-term performance with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan. \n\n(2) The discount rate is used to state expected cash flows relating to future benefits at a present value on the measurement date. This rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments whose timing would match the cash outflow of retirement benefits. Other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. \n\nPlan Assets \n\nThe Company has adopted an investment policy for a majority of plan assets, which was set by plan trustees who have the responsibility for making investment decisions related to the plan assets. The plan trustees oversee the investment allocation, including selecting professional investment managers and setting strategic targets. The investment objectives for the assets are (1) to acquire suitable assets that hold the appropriate liquidity in order to generate income and capital growth that, along with new contributions, will meet the cost of current and future benefits under the plan, (2) to limit the risk of the plan assets from failing to meet the plan liabilities over the long-term and (3) to minimize the long-term costs under the plan by maximizing the return on the plan assets. \n\nInvestment policies and strategies governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives with prudent risk parameters. Risk management practices include the use of external investment managers; the maintenance of a portfolio diversified by asset class, investment approach and security holdings; and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due. Within the equity securities class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly traded securities including both domestic and international stocks. Within the debt securities class, the investment policy provides for investments in corporate bonds as well as fixed and variable interest debt instruments. The Company currently expects to achieve a target mix of 40 % equity and 60 % debt securities in fiscal year 2023. \n\nFair Value \n\nThe fair values of the plan assets held by the Company by asset category are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 &#160; Fair Value Hierarchy Fair Value Asset Allocation Fair Value Asset Allocation Asset Category \n\nCash and cash equivalents (1) \n\nLevel 1 $ 13 &#160; 3 &#160; % $ 15 &#160; 3 &#160; % Equity Securities: Global equity securities (2)(3) \n\nLevel 2 197 &#160; 43 &#160; % 222 &#160; 39 &#160; % Debt Securities: Corporate bonds (3) \n\nLevel 2 203 &#160; 44 &#160; % 262 &#160; 45 &#160; % Government bonds (3) \n\nLevel 2 34 &#160; 7 &#160; % 58 &#160; 10 &#160; % Other Investments: Insurance contracts (4) \n\nLevel 3 12 &#160; 3 &#160; % 19 &#160; 3 &#160; % Fair value of plan assets \n\n$ 459 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 576 &#160; 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Carrying value approximates fair value. \n\n(2) Investments in equity securities by companies incorporated, listed or domiciled in developed and/or emerging market countries. \n\n(3) Investments in global equity securities, corporate bonds, government securities and government bonds are valued using the quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. \n\n(4) Consist of an insurance contract that guarantees the payment of the funded pension entitlements, as well as provides a profit share to the Company. The profit share in this contract is not based on actual investments, but, instead on a notional investment portfolio that is expected to return a pre-defined rate. Insurance contract assets are recorded at fair value and is determined based on the cash surrender value of the insured benefits which is the present value of the guaranteed funded benefits. Insurance contracts are valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), primarily by discounting expected future cash flows relating to benefits paid from a notional investment portfolio in order to determine the cash surrender value of the policy. The unobservable inputs consist of estimated future benefits to be paid throughout the duration of the policy and estimated discount rates, which both have an immaterial impact on the fair value estimate of the contract. \n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END Cash Flows \n\nThe Company expects to make cash contributions between $ 23 million and $ 28 million to its funded pension plans during fiscal year 2023. The estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Amount 2023 $ 34 &#160; 2024 $ 28 &#160; 2025 $ 30 &#160; 2026 $ 29 &#160; 2027 $ 29 &#160; 2028 through 2032 $ 141 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nProfit Sharing, 401(k) Plan and Defined Contribution Plans \n\nThe Company provides retirement benefits to its domestic employees who have completed a 30 -day period of service through a 401(k) plan that provides a matching contribution by the Company. The Company also has defined contribution benefit plans for certain of its international employees. The Company contributed approximately $ 63 million, $ 56 million and $ 56 million for defined contribution plans for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n11. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities \n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s financial performance and are referred to as market risks. The Company, where deemed appropriate, uses derivatives as risk management tools to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. \n\nForeign Currency Risk Management \n\nForward contracts are put in place to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses. A hedging relationship existed with an aggregate notional amount outstanding of $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The related forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The forward foreign exchange contract transactions will effectively lock in the value of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses against foreign currency fluctuations. The anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses being hedged are expected to occur between September 1, 2022 and August 31, 2023. \n\nIn addition to derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also enters into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. The aggregate notional amount of these outstanding contracts as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 3.4 billion and $ 3.6 billion, respectively. \n\nRefer to Note 17 &#8211; &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; for the fair values and classification of the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments. \n\nThe gains and losses recognized in earnings due to amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were not material for all periods presented and are included as components of net revenue, cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expense, which are the same line items in which the hedged items are recorded. \n\nThe following table presents the net (losses) gains from forward contracts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Under ASC 815 Location of (Loss) Gain on Derivatives Recognized in Net Income Amount of (Loss) Gain Recognized in Net Income on Derivatives Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2022 2021 2020 \n\nForward foreign exchange contracts (1) \n\nCost of revenue $ ( 71 ) $ 140 &#160; $ 42 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 87 million of foreign currency gains in cost of revenue, which are offset by the losses from the forward foreign exchange contracts. For the fiscal years ended 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $ 105 million and $ 47 million, respectively, of foreign currency losses in cost of revenue, which are offset by the gains from the forward foreign exchange contracts. \n\nInterest Rate Risk Management \n\nThe Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with the Company&#8217;s borrowings. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nThe following table presents the interest rate swaps outstanding as of August 31, 2022, which have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges (in millions): ##TABLE_START Interest Rate Swap Summary Hedged Interest Rate Payments Aggregate Notional Amount Effective Date Expiration Date Forward Interest Rate Swap Anticipated Debt Issuance Fixed $ 150 &#160; May 24, 2021 July 31, 2024 (1)(2) \n\nAnticipated Debt Issuance Fixed $ 100 &#160; August 8, 2022 July 31, 2024 (1)(2) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The contracts will be settled with the respective counterparties on a net basis at the expiration date for the forward interest rate swap. \n\n(2) If the anticipated debt issuance occurs before July 31, 2024, the contracts will be terminated simultaneously with the debt issuance. \n\nContemporaneously with the issuance of the 4.250 % Senior Notes, in April 2022 the Company settled cash flow hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $ 250 million and $ 170 million, with effective dates of November 2020 and March 2022, \n\nrespectively. The cash received for the cash flow hedges at settlement was $ 46 million. The settled cash flow hedges are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI and are amortized to interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nContemporaneously with the issuance of the 3.000 % Senior Notes in July 2020, the Company amended interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $ 200 million, with mandatory termination dates from August 15, 2020 through February 15, 2022 (the &#8220;2020 Extended Interest Rate Swaps&#8221;). In addition, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to offset future exposures of fluctuations in the fair value of the 2020 Extended Interest Rate Swaps (the &#8220;Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps&#8221;). The change in fair value of the 2020 Extended Interest Rate Swaps and Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps was recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations through the maturity date of February 15, 2022, as an adjustment to interest expense. \n\n12. Stockholders&#8217; Equity \n\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation expense within selling, general and administrative expense as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Restricted stock units $ 67 &#160; $ 91 &#160; $ 74 &#160; Employee stock purchase plan 14 &#160; 11 &#160; 9 &#160; Total $ 81 &#160; $ 102 &#160; $ 83 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEquity Compensation Plan \n\nThe 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2021 EIP&#8221;) provides for the grant of restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and other stock-based awards.

The time-based restricted stock units granted generally vest on a graded vesting schedule over three years . The performance-based restricted stock units generally vest on a cliff vesting schedule over three years and up to a maximum of 150 %, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained. The performance-based restricted stock units have a vesting condition that is based upon the Company&#8217;s cumulative adjusted core earnings per share during the performance period. The market-based restricted stock units generally vest on a cliff vesting schedule over three years and up to a maximum of 200 %, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained. The market-based restricted stock units have a vesting condition that is tied to the Company&#8217;s total shareholder return based on the Company&#8217;s stock performance in relation to the companies in the Standard and Poor&#8217;s (S&#38;P) Super Composite Technology Hardware and Equipment Index excluding the Company. \n\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock units activity from August 31, 2021 through August 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding as of August 31, 2021 5,909,131 &#160; $ 36.51 &#160; Changes during the period Shares granted (1) \n\n1,306,995 &#160; $ 68.11 &#160; Shares vested ( 2,503,143 ) $ 28.66 &#160; Shares forfeited ( 299,989 ) $ 42.90 &#160; Outstanding as of August 31, 2022 4,412,994 &#160; $ 49.87 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) For those shares granted that are based on the achievement of certain performance criteria, the amount represents the maximum number of shares that can vest.

The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10 % of an employee&#8217;s compensation, as defined in the ESPP, at a price equal to 85 % of the fair value of the common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period, whichever is lower. The ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of August 31, 2022, 11,031,290 shares remained available for issue under the 2011 ESPP. \n\nThe fair value of shares issued under the ESPP was estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Concentration of Risk and Segment Data \n\nConcentration of Risk \n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various domestic and foreign financial institutions. Deposits held with the financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits, but may generally be redeemed upon demand. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions and attempts to limit exposure with any one institution. For trade receivables, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables. \n\nSales of the Company&#8217;s products are concentrated among specific customers. For fiscal year 2022, the Company&#8217;s five largest customers accounted for approximately 44 % of its net revenue and 79 customers accounted for approximately 90 % of its net revenue. As the Company is a provider of manufacturing services and solutions and products are built based on customer specifications, it is impracticable to provide revenues from external customers for each product and service. Sales to the following customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s net revenues, expressed as a percentage of consolidated net revenue, and the percentage of accounts receivable for the customers, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Percentage of Net Revenue Fiscal Year Ended August 31, Percentage of Accounts Receivable as of August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 \n\nApple, Inc.

Some of the products manufactured by the Company require one or more components that are available from only a single source. \n\nSegment Data \n\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses; for which separate financial information is available; and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) to assess the performance of the individual segment and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment. \n\nThe Company derives its revenue from providing comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services. The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources on a segment basis. The Company&#8217;s operating segments consist of two segments &#8211; EMS and DMS, which are also the Company&#8217;s reportable segments. The segments are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. \n\nThe EMS segment is focused around leveraging IT, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing the Company&#8217;s large scale manufacturing infrastructure and the ability to serve a broad range of end markets. The EMS segment is a high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the 5G, wireless and cloud, digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap, and networking and storage industries. \n\nThe DMS segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, technologies and healthcare. The DMS segment includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, connected devices, healthcare and packaging, and mobility industries. \n\nNet revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed. An operating segment&#8217;s performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net revenue less cost of revenue, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, segment research and development expenses and an allocation of corporate manufacturing expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment income does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring, severance and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, loss on debt extinguishment, (gain) loss on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, other expense (excluding certain components of net periodic benefit cost), interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or adjustment for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. \n\nTotal segment assets are defined as accounts receivable, contract assets, inventories, net, customer-related property, plant and equipment, intangible assets net of accumulated amortization and goodwill. All other non-segment assets are reviewed on a global basis by management. Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties. \n\nThe following table presents the Company&#8217;s revenues disaggregated by segment (in millions): ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2022 2021 2020 EMS DMS Total EMS DMS Total EMS DMS Total Timing of transfer Point in time $ 6,112 &#160; $ 6,818 &#160; $ 12,930 &#160; $ 4,464 &#160; $ 7,183 &#160; $ 11,647 &#160; $ 4,363 &#160; $ 6,068 &#160; $ 10,431 &#160; Over time 10,625 &#160; 9,923 &#160; 20,548 &#160; 9,440 &#160; 8,198 &#160; 17,638 &#160; 9,730 &#160; 7,105 &#160; 16,835 &#160; Total $ 16,737 &#160; $ 16,741 &#160; $ 33,478 &#160; $ 13,904 &#160; $ 15,381 &#160; $ 29,285 &#160; $ 14,093 &#160; $ 13,173 &#160; $ 27,266 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following tables set forth operating segment information (in millions): ##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Segment income and reconciliation of income before income tax EMS $ 727 &#160; $ 509 &#160; $ 374 &#160; DMS 816 &#160; 732 &#160; 490 &#160; Total segment income $ 1,543 &#160; $ 1,241 &#160; $ 864 &#160; Reconciling items: Amortization of intangibles ( 34 ) ( 47 ) ( 56 ) Stock-based compensation expense and related charges ( 81 ) ( 102 ) ( 83 ) Restructuring, severance and related charges ( 18 ) ( 10 ) ( 157 ) Distressed customer charges &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 15 ) Business interruption and impairment charges, net \n\n&#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; ( 6 ) Acquisition and integration charges &#8212; &#160; ( 4 ) ( 31 ) Loss on debt extinguishment ( 4 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Gain (loss) on securities &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; ( 49 ) Other expense (net of periodic benefit cost) ( 29 ) ( 13 ) ( 47 ) Interest income 5 &#160; 6 &#160; 15 &#160; Interest expense ( 151 ) ( 130 ) ( 174 ) Income before income tax $ 1,231 &#160; $ 944 &#160; $ 261 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Total assets: EMS $ 5,402 &#160; $ 4,340 &#160; DMS 8,881 &#160; 8,228 &#160; Other non-allocated assets 5,434 &#160; 4,086 &#160; Total $ 19,717 &#160; $ 16,654 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company operates in more than 30 countries worldwide.

These tax incentives resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $ 80 million ($ 0.57 per basic weighted average shares outstanding), $ 51 million ($ 0.34 per basic weighted average shares outstanding) and $ 43 million ($ 0.28 per basic weighted average shares outstanding) during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n(2) For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, the impact of foreign tax rates was primarily related to increased income in low tax rate jurisdictions. \n\n(3) For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020, the changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities was primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets related to an extension of a non-U.S. tax incentive of $ 21 million. \n\n(4) For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, the valuation allowance change was primarily due to an income tax benefit of $ 26 million for the reversal of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance and decreased deferred tax assets with corresponding valuation allowances due to the liquidation of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. The valuation allowance change for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to the change in deferred tax assets for sites with existing valuation allowances. \n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities \n\nSignificant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarized below (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 176 &#160; $ 200 &#160; Receivables 4 &#160; 8 &#160; Inventories 16 &#160; 14 &#160; Compensated absences 13 &#160; 13 &#160; Accrued expenses 106 &#160; 115 &#160; Property, plant and equipment 66 &#160; 71 &#160; Domestic tax credits 11 &#160; 11 &#160; Foreign jurisdiction tax credits 4 &#160; 10 &#160; Equity compensation 10 &#160; 10 &#160; Domestic interest carryforwards 4 &#160; 4 &#160; Cash flow hedges &#8212; &#160; 10 &#160; Capital loss carryforwards 20 &#160; 20 &#160; Revenue recognition 32 &#160; 36 &#160; Operating and finance lease liabilities 72 &#160; 60 &#160; Other 27 &#160; 19 &#160; Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 561 &#160; 601 &#160; Less valuation allowances ( 281 ) ( 353 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 280 &#160; $ 248 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries $ 57 &#160; $ 60 &#160; Intangible assets 25 &#160; 27 &#160; Operating lease assets 111 &#160; 92 &#160; Other 10 &#160; 4 &#160; Total deferred tax liabilities $ 203 &#160; $ 183 &#160; Net deferred tax assets $ 77 &#160; $ 65 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nBased on the Company&#8217;s historical operating income, projection of future taxable income, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances recorded. The net decrease in valuation allowances for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 is primarily due to the reversal of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance and the change in deferred tax assets for sites with existing valuation allowances. The Company&#8217;s assessment that led to the partial release of the U.S. valuation allowance considered all available positive and negative evidence including, among other evidence, the impact of historical operating results and the impact of projected future taxable income upon application of the incremental cash tax savings approach for GILTI. \n\nAs of August 31, 2022, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested. As of August 31, 2022, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which taxes had not been provided were approximately $ 2.9 billion. The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these reinvested earnings was approximately $ 0.2 billion. \n\nTax Carryforwards \n\nThe amount and expiration dates of income tax net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and tax capital loss carryforwards, which are available to reduce future taxes, if any, as of August 31, 2022 are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Last Fiscal Year of Expiration Amount \n\nIncome tax net operating loss carryforwards: (1) \n\nDomestic - federal 2038 or indefinite $ 13 &#160; Domestic - state 2042 or indefinite $ 54 &#160; Foreign 2037 or indefinite $ 567 &#160; \n\nTax credit carryforwards: (1) \n\nDomestic - federal 2032 $ 7 &#160; Domestic - state 2027 or indefinite $ 4 &#160; Foreign (2) \n\nIndefinite $ 4 &#160; \n\nTax capital loss carryforwards: (3) \n\nDomestic - federal 2026 $ 76 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Net of unrecognized tax benefits. \n\n(2) Calculated based on the deferral method and includes foreign investment tax credits. \n\n(3) The tax capital loss carryforwards were primarily from an impairment of an investment that was deemed worthless for tax purposes. \n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits \n\nReconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits is summarized below (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Beginning balance $ 241 &#160; $ 190 &#160; $ 164 &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years 22 &#160; 15 &#160; 10 &#160; Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 21 ) ( 3 ) ( 9 ) \n\nAdditions for tax positions related to current year (1) \n\n36 &#160; 36 &#160; 27 &#160; Cash settlements ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) Reductions from lapses in statutes of limitations ( 3 ) ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Reductions from non-cash settlements with taxing authorities ( 9 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) Foreign exchange rate adjustment ( 10 ) 5 &#160; 2 &#160; Ending balance $ 253 &#160; $ 241 &#160; $ 190 &#160; Unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate (if recognized) \n\n$ 150 &#160; $ 139 &#160; $ 109 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The additions for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are primarily related to taxation of certain intercompany transactions. \n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company&#8217;s accrued interest and penalties were approximately $ 30 million as of August 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $ 0 million , $ 7 million and $ 4 million during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nIt is reasonably possible that the August 31, 2022 unrecognized tax benefits could decrease during the next 12 months by $ 18 million, primarily related to taxing authority agreements associated with intercompany transactions. \n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for fiscal years before August 31, 2018. In major non-U.S. and state jurisdictions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations for fiscal years before August 31, 2012 and August 31, 2009, respectively. \n\n16. Business Acquisitions \n\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the Company and Johnson &#38; Johnson Medical Devices Companies (&#8220;JJMD&#8221;) entered into a framework agreement to form a strategic collaboration and expand its existing relationship. The strategic collaboration expands the Company&#8217;s medical device manufacturing portfolio, diversification and capabilities. During the fiscal year ended August \n\n31, 2019, under the terms of the framework agreement, the Company completed the initial and second closings of its acquisition of certain assets of JJMD. \n\nOn September 30, 2019, under the terms of the framework agreement, the Company completed the third closing of its acquisition of certain assets of JJMD. The aggregate purchase price paid for the third closing was approximately $ 113 million in cash. For the third closing, total assets acquired of $ 196 million, including $ 81 million in contract assets, $ 34 million in inventory and $ 56 million in goodwill, and total liabilities assumed of $ 83 million, including $ 74 million of pension obligations, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. There were no intangible assets identified in this acquisition and the goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce. The majority of the goodwill is currently not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. \n\nOn October 26, 2020, under the terms of the framework agreement, the Company completed the fourth closing of its acquisition of certain assets of JJMD. The aggregate purchase price paid for the fourth closing was approximately $ 19 million in cash. Total assets acquired of $ 30 million and total liabilities assumed of $ 11 million were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. \n\nThe acquisitions of the JJMD assets were accounted for as separate business combinations for each closing using the acquisition method of accounting. The results of operations were included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial results beginning on September 30, 2019 for the third closing and October 26, 2020 for the fourth closing. The Company believes it is impracticable to provide pro forma information for the acquisitions of the JJMD assets. \n\n17.

The interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative using observable inputs including interest rate curves and credit spreads. \n\n(4) The 2020 Extended Interest Rate Swaps are considered a hybrid instrument and the Company elected the fair value option for reporting. Fair value measurements are based on the contractual terms of the contract and use observable market-based inputs. The interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows using observable inputs including interest rate curves and credit spreads. \n\nAssets Held for Sale \n\nThe following table presents the assets held for sale (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Carrying Amount Carrying Amount \n\nAssets held for sale (1) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 61 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, the Company sold assets held for sale with a carrying value of $ 61 million. \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximates fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximates current market rates. \n\nNotes payable and long-term debt is carried at amortized cost; however, the Company estimates the fair value of notes payable and long-term debt for disclosure purposes.
