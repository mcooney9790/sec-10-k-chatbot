BUSINESS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nIntroduction \n\nNewmont Corporation was incorporated in 1921 and is primarily a gold producer with significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. At December 31, 2022, Newmont had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 96.1 million ounces, attributable measured and indicated gold resources of 75.3 million ounces, attributable inferred gold resources of 36.1 million ounces, and an aggregate land position of approximately 23,700 square miles (61,500 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged in the production of copper, silver, lead and zinc. As the world&#8217;s leading gold company, Newmont remains committed to creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. \n\nNewmont&#8217;s corporate headquarters are in Denver, Colorado, U.S. In this report, &#8220;Newmont,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221; refer to Newmont Corporation together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. \n\nSegment Information \n\nOur operations are organized in five geographic regions: North America, South America, Australia, Africa and Nevada. Our North America segment consists primarily of Cripple Creek &#38; Victor (&#8220;CC&#38;V&#8221;) in the U.S., Musselwhite, Porcupine and &#201;l&#233;onore in Canada and Pe&#241;asquito in Mexico. Our South America segment consists primarily of Yanacocha in Peru, Merian in Suriname, Cerro Negro in Argentina and our 40% equity interest in the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic. Our Australia segment consists primarily of Boddington and Tanami in Australia. Our Africa segment consists primarily of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana. Our Nevada segment consists of our 38.5% interest in Nevada Gold Mines (\"NGM\") in the U.S., which is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method. \n\nIn January 2023, Newmont launched certain initiatives to reassess accountabilities of the senior leadership team and the Company's operating strategies for its operations. Depending on the timing and outcome of this assessment, the Company may change its reportable segments in 2023. \n\nFor information on acquisitions and asset sales impacting the comparability of our results, refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. \n\nRefer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below, and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to our reportable segments. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to domestic and export sales and lack of dependence on a limited number of customers. \n\nProducts \n\nReferences in this report to &#8220;attributable&#8221; means that portion of gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources based on our proportionate ownership, unless otherwise noted. \n\nGold \n\nGeneral. We had consolidated gold production from continuing operations of 5.8 million ounces (6.0 million attributable gold ounces) in 2022, 5.9 million ounces (6.0 million attributable gold ounces) in 2021 and 5.8 million ounces (5.9 million attributable gold ounces) in 2020. Attributable gold ounces produced includes 0.3, 0.3, and 0.4 million attributable gold ounces for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the Pueblo Viejo mine, which is 40% owned by Newmont and accounted for as an equity method investment. Of our 2022 consolidated gold production, approximately 25% came from North America, 16% from South America, 22% from Australia, 17% from Africa and 20% from Nevada. \n\nFor 2022, 2021 and 2020, 87%, 86% and 90%, respectively, of our Sales were attributable to gold. Most of our Sales come from the sale of refined gold. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally dor&#233; bars. Dor&#233; is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Dor&#233; is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the dor&#233; bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to our account or delivered to buyers. A portion of gold sold from Pe&#241;asquito in North America and Boddington in Australia is sold in a concentrate containing other metals such as copper, silver, lead and/or zinc. \n\nGold Uses. Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry. \n\nGold Supply. A combination of mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information \n\navailable, for the years 2020 through 2022, mine production has averaged approximately 75% of the annual gold supply with the remainder primarily sourced from recycled gold. \n\nGold Price. The following table presents the annual high, low and average daily afternoon LBMA Gold Price over the past ten years on the London Bullion Market ($/ounce): \n\n##TABLE_START Year High Low Average \n\n2023 (through February 16, 2023) \n\n$ 1,955 $ 1,835 $ 1,891 2022 $ 2,039 $ 1,629 $ 1,800 2021 $ 1,943 $ 1,684 $ 1,799 2020 $ 2,067 $ 1,474 $ 1,770 2019 $ 1,546 $ 1,270 $ 1,393 2018 $ 1,355 $ 1,178 $ 1,268 2017 $ 1,346 $ 1,151 $ 1,257 2016 $ 1,366 $ 1,077 $ 1,251 2015 $ 1,296 $ 1,049 $ 1,160 2014 $ 1,385 $ 1,142 $ 1,266 2013 $ 1,694 $ 1,192 $ 1,411 ##TABLE_END\n\nOn February 16, 2023, the afternoon LBMA gold price was $1,837 per ounce. \n\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how we recognize revenue for gold sales from dor&#233; production. \n\nOther Co-product Metals \n\nGenerally, if a metal expected to be mined represents more than 10% to 20% of the life of mine sales value of all the metal expected to be mined, the metal is considered a co-product and recognized as Sales in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCopper production at Boddington and silver, lead and zinc production at Pe&#241;asquito are considered co-products. Copper, silver, lead and zinc sales are generally in the form of concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. \n\nThe following table details consolidated co-product production and the percentage of Sales that was attributable to copper, silver, lead and zinc for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Co-product Production Sales as % of Total Sales Co-product Production Sales as % of Total Sales Co-product Production Sales as % of Total Sales \n\nCopper (pounds/millions) (1) \n\n84 3 % 71 2 % 56 1 % \n\nSilver (ounces/millions) (2) \n\n29.7 5 % 31.4 5 % 27.8 5 % \n\nLead (pounds/millions) (2) \n\n149 1 % 177 2 % 179 1 % \n\nZinc (pounds/millions) (2) \n\n377 4 % 435 5 % 381 3 % ##TABLE_END ____________________________ \n\n(1) All of our copper co-product production came from Australia. \n\n(2) All of our silver, lead and zinc co-product production came from North America. \n\nBy-product Metals \n\nIf a metal expected to be mined falls below the co-product sales value percentages, the metal is considered a by-product. Revenues from by-product sales are credited to Costs applicable to sales in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAside from the co-product sales at Boddington and Pe&#241;asquito, copper and silver produced at other Newmont sites are by-product metals. \n\nGold and Other Metals Processing Methods \n\nDor&#233;. Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit to recover the gold. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable, synthetically lined pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold contained within the ore. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation. \n\nGold contained in ores that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores. \n\nSome gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. \n\nConcentrate. At Pe&#241;asquito, sulfide ore is delivered to a crushing and grinding plant which feeds a sulfide processing plant. The sulfide processing plant primarily comprises lead and zinc flotation stages. In the lead and zinc flotation, the slurry is conditioned with reagents to activate the desired minerals and produce lead and zinc concentrate. The lead concentrate is highly enriched in gold and silver, with a smaller fraction of the precious metal recovered in the zinc concentrate. The resulting concentrate is sold to smelters or traders for further processing. \n\nAt Boddington, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation resulting in a gold/copper concentrate containing approximately 15% to 20% copper. The flotation tailings have a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately twenty-five percent of total worldwide mined gold production. We currently rank as the top gold producer with approximately five percent of estimated total worldwide mined gold production. Our competitive position is based on the size and grade of our ore bodies anchored in favorable mining jurisdictions and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers. We have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce, and to manage our costs. \n\nLicenses and Concessions \n\nOther than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contracts with, the host government. These countries include, among others, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Australia and Ghana. Refer to Item 2, Properties, below for further information on licenses and concessions by property. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with the host country. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information. \n\nCondition of Physical Assets and Insurance \n\nOur business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. Refer to Results of Consolidated Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources within Part II, Item 7, MD&#38;A, for further information. \n\nWe maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information. \n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance \n\nESG Overview. Focusing on leading environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices are a core part of Newmont&#8217;s business. Widely recognized for our principled ESG practices, we have been consistently ranked as a leader in the mining and metal sector S&#38;P Global, and we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (&#8220;DJSI World&#8221;) since 2007. \n\nESG is a key part of how we make investment decisions and central to our culture and purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Sustainability and safety are integrated into the business at all levels of the organization through our global policies, standards, strategies, business plans and remuneration plans. In 2022, we refreshed our Sustainability and External Relations Strategy with the review and oversight of our Board and Safety &#38; Sustainability Committee to better reflect how ESG practices and expectations have evolved with a vision to generate shared value and serve as a catalyst for sustainable development. In support of our vision, our updated strategy is made up of four strategic pillars: \n\n&#8226; Leadership &#8211; Demonstrate consistent and courageous leadership through our words and actions \n\n&#8226; Integration &#8211; Integrate leading sustainability practices into our overall business processes and decision-making \n\n&#8226; Engagement &#8211; Build trust and credibility through respectful and meaningful engagement, communication and transparent reporting \n\n&#8226; Performance &#8211; Deliver leading environmental and social performance to manage risk and achieve beneficial outcomes \n\nDriving our sustainability practices and supporting our ability to meet the ambitions of each strategic pillar are the following critical enablers: \n\n&#8226; Environmental stewardship &#8211; Leading practices through the enhancement of shared resources and reduction of long-term liabilities incorporating nature, water and climate \n\n&#8226; Social responsibility &#8211; Leading practices that mitigate impacts, generate value for local communities and governments, and promote transparent and meaningful engagement to build credibility and support our reputation \n\n&#8226; Governance &#8211; Leading practices through an effective standardized framework that includes global policies and standards integrated risk management systems; metrics and targets to measure our performance; and processes to enable transparent reporting and improved collaboration and ensure optimal decision-making and resource allocation \n\nESG Stakeholder Engagement . We engage regularly with relevant stakeholders, who we consider to be any person or organization potentially impacted by our activities or influential to our success, which allows us to gain a greater understanding of their needs, interests and perspectives while, at the same time, encouraging shared decision making to promote mutually beneficial outcomes. These engagements also inform what information is most useful for stakeholders for the purposes of our non-financial reporting. Newmont also engages with a variety of organizations at a global, regional, national and local level to adhere to high standards of governance, social and environmental policies and performance. These memberships and voluntary commitments reflect our values, support our approach to working collaboratively on best practices across several key matters and allow external stakeholders to hold us accountable. Our participation in industry initiatives, wherein we often take a leadership role, allows us to inform and influence global standards and practices, as well as gain insight into emerging expectations and issues. \n\nESG Reporting . We believe that transparency and accountability are key attributes of governance. Since 2003, Newmont has been reporting on how we manage the sustainability issues of relevance to stakeholders around the globe. Our sustainability report provides an annual review of non-financial performance updates on governance, strategy and management approach, risk management, and performance and targets in key areas that include health, safety and security, workforce, the environment, supply chain, social acceptance, business integrity and compliance, value sharing, and equity, inclusion and diversity domains. Our sustainability report is compiled in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (\"GRI\") 2021 Universal Standards Core option, the GRI Mining and Metals Sector Supplement, and the SASB Metals &#38; Mining standards, is externally assured, and reflects Newmont&#8217;s commitment to transparency and reporting obligations as a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (\"ICMM\") and as an early adopter of the United Nations (\"UN\") Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. Additionally, our sustainability report aligns with the ICMM's Mining Principles' Performance Expectations, GISTM and the World Gold Council's Responsible Gold Mining Principles. \n\nNewmont&#8217;s sustainability reporting suite also includes our climate report, sustainability-linked bond framework, ESG data tables, conflict-free gold report, policy influence disclosures, political spending disclosures, economic impact reports, taxes and royalties contributions report, CDP (formerly, &#8220;Carbon Disclosure Project&#8221;) responses, and other reports and responses, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com/sustainability. The information on our website, including, without limitation, in the annual sustainability report and climate report, should not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report or otherwise &#8220;filed&#8221; for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. \n\nEnvironmental Practices \n\nClimate Change. We accept the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#8217;s (\"IPCC\") assessment of climate science, and we acknowledge that human activities contribute to climate change and business has an important role in addressing this global challenge. It is our firm belief that climate change is one of the greatest global challenges of our time. For a discussion of climate-related risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors. \n\nClimate Targets and Initiatives to Achieve. As the world&#8217;s leading gold mining company, we believe that value-creation industries like mining have a responsibility to drive bold actions and innovation to transition us to a low-carbon economy. In an effort to play our part in addressing climate change, in 2020 we announced science-based, GHG emissions reduction targets of 32% for Scope 1 and Scope 2 and 30% for Scope 3 by 2030 (\"2030 climate targets\"), with an ultimate goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. Our 2030 targets have been approved and validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative, which ensures that our targets support the Paris Agreement&#8217;s goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. \n\nOur most significant opportunities to reduce emissions exist in building or deploying cleaner energy solutions at the mine sites, as well as the greening of the electrical grid that supplies energy to our operations. Since announcing our 2030 climate targets, we have taken steps to invest in climate change initiatives in support of our goal. As part of these initiatives, in November 2021, Newmont announced a strategic alliance with Caterpillar Inc. (&#8220;CAT&#8221;) with the aim to develop and implement a comprehensive all-electric autonomous mining system to achieve safer and more productive operations while also supporting Newmont in achieving our climate targets. Newmont pledged an investment of $100 to CAT, of which $39 has been paid as of December 31, 2022. These dollars fund collaborative work to develop and deploy electric equipment for surface and underground mining at Newmont&#8217;s Cripple Creek &#38; Victor mine in Colorado, U.S. and Tanami mine in Northern Territory, Australia. Other investments supporting our climate change initiatives are expected to include emissions reduction projects and renewable energy opportunities as we seek to achieve these climate targets. \n\nWe also see sustainable finance as a way to further demonstrate Newmont's commitment to achieving our 2030 climate targets. In December 2021, Newmont became the first in the mining industry to issue a sustainability-linked bond, with the registered public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.6% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2032 (the \"Notes\"), with the coupon linked to Newmont&#8217;s performance against key ESG commitments regarding 2030 climate targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles target. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Newmont published a Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework and obtained a second party opinion on the framework from Institutional Shareholder Services group of companies (\"ISS\") ESG. This follows Newmont&#8217;s decision earlier in 2021 to amend its revolving credit facility to include an interest rate margin adjustment based on the Company&#8217;s ESG external ratings. The Notes and Revolver align Newmont&#8217;s business and financing with its commitments and values by creating a direct link between its sustainability performance and funding strategies. \n\nIn addition to our focus on reducing carbon emissions, we believe that access to clean, safe water is a human right, and reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. Because water is also critical to our business, we recognize the need to use water efficiently, protect water resources, and collaborate with the stakeholders within the watersheds where we operate to effectively manage this shared resource. We operate in water-stressed areas with limited supply and increasing population and water demand. Increasing pressure on water use may occur due to increased populations in and around communities in proximity to our operations. We have set annual water efficiency targets through 2023 to reduce freshwater consumption and developed water action plans in support of our goal to achieve water stewardship. \n\nBiodiversity. Our operations span four continents in a range of ecosystems that include tropical, desert and arctic climates. We understand the impact our activities can have on the environment and are committed to protect and prevent &#8211; or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate &#8211; those impacts in the areas where we operate through responsible management during all aspects of the mine lifecycle and collaboration with stakeholders to develop integrated approaches to land use. \n\nOur Environmental Impact. We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. \n\nOur Environmental Reclamation and Remediation Commitments. Each operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets, in all material respects, applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. The reclamation and remediation stage is a multifaceted process with complex risks. Successfully closing and reclaiming mines is crucial for gaining stakeholder trust and maintaining social acceptance. Notably, Newmont is committed to the implementation of the GISTM and all tailing storage facilities are expected to be in conformance with the GISTM by 2025. Compliance with GISTM remains on-going and has and may continue to result in further increases to our sustaining costs and estimated closure costs. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in connection with closure are becoming increasingly stringent. Compliance with water management and discharge quality remains dynamic and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated closure costs. For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, refer to Note 5 and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of regulatory, tailings storage facilities, water, climate and other environmental risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. \n\nSocial Practices \n\nOur People. At Newmont, one of the strategic pillars is people. \n\nThe success of our business comes from the accomplishments and well-being of our employees and contractors. That is why we strive to build a workplace culture that fosters leaders where everyone belongs, thrives, and is valued. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, approximately 14,600 people were employed by Newmont and Newmont subsidiaries and approximately 17,800 people were working as contractors in support of Newmont&#8217;s operations and attainment of our objectives. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, approximately 33% of our workforce were members of a union or participated in collective bargaining. We are committed to fostering solid relationships with all members of our workforce based on trust, treating workers fairly and providing them with safe and healthy working conditions. For a discussion of related risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors. \n\nIn 2022, the full Board reviewed and approved our refreshed global people strategy. Our people strategy represents a multi-year journey, and its three pillars and respective aspirations include: (i) leadership &#8211; grow and attract exceptional leaders for our Company, the industry and beyond; (ii) inclusion, diversity and equity - through bold actions cultivate an inclusive, diverse and engaged workforce; and (iii) people experiences - foster a meaningful work experience that enables our culture and strategy to flourish. The Board of Directors&#8217; Leadership Development and Compensation Committee holds reviews with management every quarter and on an ad hoc basis as needed to ensure appropriate management of human capital and progress against our stated goals. \n\nThe people who work on our behalf give us a competitive advantage. Through our global people strategy, we align our talent management efforts with the overall business strategy. The strategy&#8217;s focus areas include enhancing the employee experience and evolving for future workforce needs; building our bench strength and leadership capabilities; developing effective labor relations that align stakeholders with a shared future; and improving inclusion, including reaching gender parity. \n\nInclusion and Diversity. We believe that progressing an inclusive workplace culture is a critical part of tackling the challenge of attracting and retaining diverse employees. We are also active participants in the Paradigm for Parity framework, a coalition of business leaders committed to a workplace where women and men have equal power, status and opportunity in senior leadership, and we are committed to advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goal to achieve gender equality. Newmont has committed to increasing women in senior leadership roles to 50% by 2030 in line with Paradigm for Parity objectives. \n\nIn 2022, we did significant work to identify those practices that would most significantly improve diverse representation and advancement in our business. Enterprise-wide female representation at the end of 2022 increased from 14 percent in 2021 to 15 percent despite challenges associated with the pandemic and shifts in the labor market. Site-based action plans were established and overall representation of females in operations increased from 8% to 9% in 2022. Female representation in senior leadership roles also increased from 26% to 30% in 2022. Female representation at the Board level in 2022 was 45% of independent directors with 70% of independent directors being either gender or ethnically diverse. \n\nIn our annual sustainability report, Newmont voluntarily reports workforce and labor information in accordance with GRI Standards, including data on workforce demographics, compensation and equal remuneration, gender diversity, union representation, labor relations, employee turnover, hiring representation, and training and development. Newmont also reports employment data in U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEO-1 reports which can be found on our website. The information in our sustainability report and on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report. \n\nESG Performance-based Compensation. The importance of ESG performance is emphasized with our workforce through our training and development programs and our compensation design. Employees eligible for our short-term incentive plan are held accountable for the Company&#8217;s health, safety and sustainability performance through Newmont&#8217;s performance-based compensation structure. ESG will comprise 30% of the Company&#8217;s Short-term Incentive Plan payout for 2022, with 20% allocated to health &#38; safety metrics and 10% to sustainability performance based upon key public indices. In 2022, Newmont generated strong above target results in our health and safety and our sustainability measures with all sites and regions having performed above target for manager/supervisor critical control verifications and manager coaching to support fatality risk management, and strong recognition by external rating agencies in connection with sustainability, including with S&#38;P Global CSA (DJSI) ranking Newmont as the co-leader in the Mining &#38; Metals sector. \n\nAdditional information regarding the Company&#8217;s compensation programs and performance will be provided in the 2023 Proxy Statement. \n\nHealth and Safety. We believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We continue to sustain robust controls at our operations and offices around the globe, including a risk-based application of controls in connection with COVID-19 to protect both our workforce and the local communities in which we operate. In addition, the Company has an established Health &#38; Safety Management System and Health, Safety and Security Standards that in most cases exceed regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The quality of our Health &#38; Safety Management System is audited regularly as part of our assurance and governance process. \n\nIn 2022, we launched a refreshed three-year Health, Safety and Security Strategy that advances our journey toward a fatality, injury and illness-free workplace. The updated strategy recognizes the progress we have made while also acknowledging the need to further improve our performance. The strategy links our health, safety and security work together across three themes: \n\n&#8226; Act on risk &#8212; Control future outcomes by acting to reduce risks and minimize potential impacts. \n\n&#8226; Actively care &#8212; Consistently take action to engage and support our employees and business partners. \n\n&#8226; Apply knowledge &#8212; Foster a knowledge-sharing mindset, apply what we learn and inspire innovation. \n\nSupporting and extending the impact of our strategy are the following three amplifiers: \n\n&#8226; Data &#8212; Consolidating the various data systems into a data warehouse we can analyze and obtain insights. \n\n&#8226; Technology &#8212; Leverage new and existing technology and innovation to provide data, reduce risk, improve decision making and engage our people. \n\n&#8226; Communication &#8212; Encourage communications with employees and contractors (particularly those on site with the greatest exposure to risks) to remain focused on the right work and retain agility based on our changing environment and risk profile. \n\nThe strategy will track efforts to build (identifying capabilities, frameworks and tools we need to develop), embed (penetrating, engaging and sustaining impacts) and expand (growing and collaborating) work across the health, safety and security programs. \n\nThe quality and quantity of critical control verifications (\"CCVs\") in the field are important leading indicators for preventing fatalities and significant potential events (\"SPEs\"). In 2022, we completed over 620,000 CCVs in the field (a 31% increase compared to 2021). More than 69,000 controls were identified as absent or failed, which means we were able to implement the control in the field and prevent a serious event. SPEs were down 36% compared to 2021. \n\nCommitments to Communities. Newmont aims to better understand both the positive and negative impacts that our activities have on host communities, and to engage impacted communities and groups to mitigate or optimize these impacts in a manner that is culturally appropriate and with the consent of those impacted. We strive to build meaningful relationships with stakeholders and recognize the need to understand, minimize and mitigate our impacts and to build long-term, positive partnerships. We also recognize our responsibility to respect and promote human rights. At our sites on or adjacent to Indigenous Peoples&#8217; territories, we respect and acknowledge the individual and collective rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples in line with the International Labour Organization (\"ILO\") Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \n\nGovernance Practices \n\nBoard of Directors Oversight. Newmont believes that strong corporate governance, with management accountability and active oversight from an experienced Board of Directors, is essential for mitigating risk, serving in the best interests of all stakeholders and creating long-term value. The highest level of oversight at Newmont resides with Newmont&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;). The Board plays a critical role, overseeing the Company&#8217;s business strategy and the overall goal of delivering long-term value creation for shareholders and other stakeholders. The members of Newmont&#8217;s Board bring a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and talents, along with ethnic, racial and gender diversity, to our governance process. As of December 31, 2022, the Board was comprised of 12 directors (11 independent non-executive directors and one executive director) with more than 70% of the independent directors with a form of ethnic, racial or gender diversity to the Board, with 45% female representation among independent directors. \n\nFour core Board committees, Audit, Corporate Governance and Nominating, Leadership Development and Compensation, and Safety and Sustainability, provide oversight and guidance in key areas. Each committee assists the Board in carrying out responsibilities such as assessing major risks, ensuring high standards of ethical business conduct, succession planning and talent management, and approving and providing oversight of the sustainability strategy, which includes commitments to adoption of best practices in promotion of a healthy and safe work environment, and environmentally sound and socially responsible mining and resource development. All members of these four core Committees are independent, as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and Newmont&#8217;s Corporate Governance Guidelines. More information on Newmont&#8217;s Board, governance practices and risk oversight can be found in our annual Proxy Statement. \n\nCode of Conduct. Our global Code of Conduct (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), which was adopted and approved by Newmont&#8217;s Board, forms the foundation for our integrity expectations, and six overarching policies, along with our standards on Anti-Corruption, Conflicts of Interest, Gifts and Entertainment and U.S. Export Compliance, state the minimum requirements for conducting business honestly, ethically and in the best interests of Newmont. Our Code reflects our belief that as important as what we do is how we do it. It requires all representatives of Newmont to demonstrate our values &#8211; safety, integrity, sustainability, inclusion and responsibility &#8211; in every aspect of our professional lives and ultimately, to live up to our purpose, which is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. \n\nGovernance Materials. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Proxy Statement, policies, and the charters for the Committees of Board of Directors are available on our website, www.newmont.com, and are available free of charge upon request to Investor Relations at our principal executive office. We also file with the New York Stock Exchange an annual certification that our Chief Executive Officer is unaware of any violation of the NYSE&#8217;s corporate governance standards.

As a global business, we are committed to doing our part to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and protect people and their livelihoods. Newmont engaged its Rapid Response process early in connection with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and continues to proactively take steps \n\nto prevent further transmission. These steps have included a risk-based approach to the application of controls including, but not limited to the following: \n\n&#8226; Enforcing social distancing protocols; \n\n&#8226; Providing flexible and remote working plans for employees; \n\n&#8226; Providing logistical and healthcare support to nearby communities where needed; \n\n&#8226; Conducting screenings at entry to sites and pre-travel and on-entry screening tests for sites in high risk locations; \n\n&#8226; Restricting workplace access for confirmed and suspected COVID cases as well as close contacts with a confirmed case of COVID-19; and, \n\n&#8226; Providing support to facilitate access to initial and booster vaccination doses for employees and nearby communities. \n\nIn April 2020, we established the Newmont Global Community Support Fund, a $20 fund to help host communities, governments and employees combat the COVID-19 pandemic, of which approximately $17 has been distributed through December 31, 2022. The fund is designed to focus on employee and community health, food security and local economic resilience through partnerships with local governments, medical institutions, charities and non-governmental organizations to address the greatest needs with long-term resiliency and future community development in mind. \n\nOur mines continue to incur costs related to health and safety measures taken to combat the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. For a discussion of COVID-19 related risks to the business, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors. \n\nRefer also to Consolidated Financial Results, Results of Consolidated Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources within Part II, Item 7, MD&#38;A, for additional information about the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations. \n\nRisk Factor Summary \n\nWe are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including risks related to our operations and business, financial risks, risks related to our industry, environmental and climate risks, risks related to the jurisdictions in which we operate, risks related to our workforce, legal risks and risks related to our common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks that we deem material are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of this report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; A substantial or extended decline in gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices would have a material adverse effect on us. \n\n&#8226; We may be unable to replace gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead reserves as they become depleted. \n\n&#8226; Estimates of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources are uncertain and actual recoveries may vary from our estimates. \n\n&#8226; Estimates relating to projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated. \n\n&#8226; Increased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability. \n\n&#8226; Mine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made. \n\n&#8226; Our operations and business have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future by pandemics, epidemics, or other health emergencies. \n\n&#8226; Challenges in maintaining positive community relations and reputation can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects. \n\n&#8226; We are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation, upgrade, operation and integration. \n\n&#8226; Our interests in joint ventures remains subject to risk. \n\n&#8226; Increased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and capital controls may adversely affect Newmont&#8217;s costs, earnings and the value of some of our assets. \n\n&#8226; Future funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pay cash dividends or our ability to engage in share repurchase transactions. \n\n&#8226; Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing. \n\n&#8226; Our results could be significantly impacted by impairments. \n\n&#8226; Returns for investments in pension plans are uncertain. \n\n&#8226; Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income. \n\n&#8226; Civil disturbances, criminal activities, illegal mining and artisanal mining can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability. \n\n&#8226; Competition from other natural resource companies may harm our business. \n\n&#8226; We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining. \n\n&#8226; We may be unable to obtain or retain necessary permits and leases, which could adversely affect our operations. \n\n&#8226; Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate. \n\n&#8226; Our operations are subject to extensive health and safety and environmental laws and regulations. \n\n&#8226; Our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy. \n\n&#8226; Our operations are subject to transitional and physical risks related to climate change. \n\n&#8226; Our operations are subject to geotechnical challenges. \n\n&#8226; Our operations may be adversely affected by rising energy prices or energy shortages. \n\n&#8226; Our operations are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining operations. \n\n&#8226; Our operations are subject to risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions, including political, economic and other risks. \n\n&#8226; Our business depends on good relations with our employees, and if we are unable to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees, our business and future operations may be adversely affected \n\n&#8226; We rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects. \n\n&#8226; New legislation and tax risks in various operating jurisdictions could negatively affect us. \n\n&#8226; Our business is subject to changing regulations and laws, including, without limitation, extraterritorial and domestic anti-bribery laws and regulations, a breach or violation of which could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm. \n\n&#8226; Title to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or subject to legal challenge in the future. \n\n&#8226; The price of our common stock may be volatile, and holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the future. \n\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nForward-Looking Statements \n\nCertain statements contained in this report (including information incorporated by reference herein) are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221;

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nOur business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221; \n\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Business \n\nA substantial or extended decline in gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices would have a material adverse effect on us. \n\nOur business is dependent on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include: \n\n&#8226; Gold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks; \n\n&#8226; Speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals; \n\n&#8226; The relative strength of the U.S. dollar; \n\n&#8226; The monetary policies employed by the world&#8217;s major Central Banks; \n\n&#8226; The fiscal policies employed by the world&#8217;s major industrialized economies; \n\n&#8226; Expectations of the future rate of inflation; \n\n&#8226; Interest rates; \n\n&#8226; Recession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries; \n\n&#8226; Decreased industrial, jewelry, base metal or investment demand; \n\n&#8226; Increased import and export taxes; \n\n&#8226; Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap; \n\n&#8226; Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; \n\n&#8226; Availability of cheaper substitute materials; and \n\n&#8226; Changing investor or consumer sentiment, including in connection with transition to a low-carbon economy, investor interest in crypto currencies and other investment alternatives and other factors. \n\nAverage gold prices for 2022 were $1,800 per ounce (2021: $1,799; 2020: $1,770), average copper prices for 2022 were $3.99 per pound (2021: $4.23; 2020: $2.80), average silver prices for 2022 were $21.73 per ounce (2021: $25.12; 2020: $20.55), average lead prices for 2022 were $0.98 per pound (2021: $1.00; 2020: $0.83) and average zinc prices for 2022 were $1.58 per pound (2021: $1.36; 2020: $1.03). Any decline in our realized prices adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to sales of gold, silver, copper, lead or zinc. We have recorded impairments in the current year and may experience additional impairments in future years as a result of lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices. \n\nIn addition, sustained lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices can: \n\n&#8226; Reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that become uneconomic at sustained lower metal prices; \n\n&#8226; Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might be required to record write downs related to the carrying value of its stockpiles and ore on leach pads; \n\n&#8226; Halt or delay the development of new projects; \n\n&#8226; Reduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and \n\n&#8226; Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices \n\nWe may be unable to replace gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead reserves as they become depleted. \n\nMining companies must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. \n\nWe may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate reserves and resources. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties. \n\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. \n\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates. \n\nThe reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc that we estimated, at December 31, 2022, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, or will be, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. If our reserve estimations are required to be revised due to significantly lower gold, silver, zinc, copper and lead prices, increases in operating costs, reductions in metallurgical recovery or other modifying factors, this could result in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties, goodwill and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges. \n\nProducers use feasibility studies for undeveloped ore bodies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change. \n\nAdditionally, resources do not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company&#8217;s standards. Estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Inferred resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. The Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the resource will ever be converted into reserves. \n\nIn addition, if the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead declines from recent levels, if production costs increase, grades decline, recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, the indicated level of recovery may not be realized or mineral reserves or resources might not be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our mineral reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves and resources. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and resources are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired. \n\nReserves and resources disclosed in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with the Regulation S-K 1300. In 2021, the Company transitioned its approach to reporting and internal methodologies to take into account the required change from the SEC&#8217;s Industry Guide 7 to Regulation S-K 1300. To the extent that regulators adopt new requirements and issue or modify related guidance and interpretations in the future, it could results in changes to mineral reserve and mineral resource information. \n\nEstimates relating to projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated. \n\nMine development and expansion projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up. Our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others: \n\n&#8226; Changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed; \n\n&#8226; Changes in input commodity and labor costs; \n\n&#8226; The quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made; \n\n&#8226; Increases in development capital and investment costs; \n\n&#8226; Adverse geotechnical conditions; \n\n&#8226; Availability of adequate and skilled labor force; \n\n&#8226; Availability, supply and cost including: water, reagents, and power; \n\n&#8226; Costs related to environmental management and sales including waste management, monitoring and transport and storage of product sales; \n\n&#8226; Fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates; \n\n&#8226; Availability and terms of financing; \n\n&#8226; Delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development; \n\n&#8226; Changes in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements; \n\n&#8226; Government instability, including but not limited to decreased support for development of mining projects; \n\n&#8226; Weather or severe climate impacts, including, without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation, drought and/or sub-zero temperatures; \n\n&#8226; Potential delays and restrictions in connection with health and safety issues, including pandemics (such as COVID-19 and related variants) and other infectious diseases; \n\n&#8226; Potential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages; and \n\n&#8226; Potential challenges to mining activities or to permits or other approvals or delays in development and construction of projects based on claims of disturbance of cultural resources or the inability to secure consent for such disturbance. \n\nNew projects require, among other things, the successful completion of feasibility studies, attention to various fiscal, tax and royalty matters, obtainment of, and compliance with, required governmental permits and arrangements for necessary surface and other land rights. We may also have to identify adequate sources of water and power for new projects, ensure that appropriate community \n\ninfrastructure (for example, reliable rail, ports, roads, and bridges) is developed to support the project and secure appropriate financing to fund a new project. These infrastructures and services are often provided by third parties whose operational activities are outside of our control. Establishing infrastructure for our development projects requires significant resources, identification of adequate sources of raw materials and supplies, and the cooperation of national and regional governments, none of which can be assured. In addition, new projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future financial and operating performance, including future cash flow. Thus, it is possible that actual costs may increase significantly and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates. Consequently, our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. \n\nFor our existing operations, we base our mine plans on geological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and commodity price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and resources, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with mining operations. Further, future positive revisions, if any, remain subject to improvements in costs, recovery, commodity price or a combination of these and other factors. Additionally, we review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, and an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other favorable events occur. As a result of these uncertainties, actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook. \n\nIncreased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability. \n\nCosts at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses, and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow. \n\nOur operational costs, including, without limitation, labor costs, can be impacted by inflation. Certain of our operations are located in countries that have in the past experienced high rates of inflation, such as in Argentina, Suriname, and Ghana. It is possible that in the future, high inflation in the countries in which we operate may result in an increase in operational costs in local currencies (without a concurrent devaluation of the local currency of operations against the dollar or an increase in the dollar price of gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead). A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow. \n\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with new projects, costs related to closure reclamation activities, and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects. Significantly higher and sustained increases in operational costs or capital expenditures could result in the deferral or closure of projects and mines in the event that costs become prohibitive. \n\nMine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made. \n\nNatural resource extractive companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may change materially. \n\nAdditionally, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. Under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) and its state law equivalents, current or former owners of properties may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of site cleanup or required to undertake remedial actions in response to unpermitted releases of hazardous substances at such property, in addition to, among other potential consequences, liability to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be significant. These subject properties are referred to as &#8220;superfund&#8221; sites. For example, the inactive Midnite uranium mine is a superfund site subject to CERCLA. It is possible that certain of our other current or former operations, projects or exploration locations in the U.S. could be designated as a superfund site in the future, exposing us to potential liability under CERCLA. \n\nThe laws and regulations governing mine closure and reclamation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. For a more detailed description of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position. Any underestimated or unanticipated retirement and rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders and potentially result in impairments. \n\nFor example, in early 2015 and again in June 2017, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment (&#8220;MINAM&#8221;), issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria modified the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In 2017, Yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the Mining Ministry (&#8220;MINEM&#8221;). The Company did not receive a response or comments to this submission until 2021 and is in the process of updating its compliance achievement plan to address these comments. During this interim period, Yanacocha separately submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment modification considering the ongoing operations and the projects to be developed and obtained authorization from MINEM for such projects. This authorization included a deadline for compliance with the modified water quality criteria by January 2024. In May 2022, Yanacocha submitted a proposal modification to this plan requesting an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations in 2027. In the event that MINEM does not grant Yanacocha an extension of the previously authorized timeline for, and agree to, the updated compliance achievement plan, fines and penalties relating to non-compliance may result beyond January 2024. \n\nThe Company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by MINAM, as referenced above, will be met. This also includes performing a comprehensive update to the Yanacocha reclamation plan to address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. These ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, were progressed in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the study team continued to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. While certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s annual 2022 update process for all asset retirement obligations, the Company recorded an increase of $511 to the Yanacocha reclamation liability based on the progress of the closure studies with a corresponding non-cash charge of $529 recorded to reclamation expense related to portions of site operations no longer in production with no expected substantive future economic value and $18 recorded as a decrease to the asset retirement cost for producing areas of the operation. The annual 2022 update included an initial consideration of known risks (including the associated risk that water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). However, these and other risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of our tailings storage facility management, review of Yanacocha&#8217;s water balance and storm water management system and review of post-closure management costs. The ongoing Yanacocha closure studies are expected to be progressed in 2023 and continue in the future. Future material increases or decreases to the asset retirement obligation could occur as additional analyses are completed and further refinements to water quality and volume modeling are completed. Additionally, revisions to the Yanacocha reclamation plan may change in connection with the Company&#8217;s ultimate submission and review of the plan with Peruvian regulators. Refer to Notes 5 and 25 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reclamation and remediation, and Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Company&#8217;s interest in Yanacocha. \n\nOur operations and business have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future by pandemics, epidemics and other health emergencies. \n\nThe Company faces risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could significantly disrupt operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts on the world, our industry and our Company. Despite protocols we have developed and deployed, COVID-19 and its variants present ongoing risks and challenges, and could continue to impact our people, operations and surrounding Communities. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 impacted the operation of Newmont&#8217;s mines and the development of projects and exploration activities and may continue to do so in the future. The governments in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate implemented restrictive measures such as travel bans, quarantine and self-isolation at various times during the pandemic and may do so again in the future. The scope and duration of any such restrictions remains outside of the Company&#8217;s control. The Company carefully considers government restrictions and the needs of its employees and host communities. Additionally, based upon evolving contagion rates or occurrences at our operating sites, senior management or the Board may be required to or decide to reduce or limit operational activities to essential care and maintenance procedures including the management of critical environmental systems. For example, in order to protect nearby communities and align with government travel restrictions or health considerations certain of Newmont&#8217;s operations were temporarily put into care and maintenance resulting in a temporary decrease in production at these sites in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the majority of our sites experienced pandemic-related absenteeism in 2021 and early 2022. Reductions in our operational activities due to COVID-19, or another pandemic, epidemic or health outbreak, could result in additional sites being placed \n\ninto care and maintenance for extended periods of time and/or have a material adverse impact on our business, or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If the majority of our sites are placed into care and maintenance, this could significantly reduce our cash flow and impact our ability to meet certain covenants related to our revolving credit facility and borrowing capacity. \n\nThe Company incurred, and could continue to incur costs as a result of actions taken to protect against the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to comply with local mandates, including but not limited additional health screenings, incremental travel, security and employee-related costs. Other impacts of changing government restrictions and the evolving health environment in connection with pandemics, epidemics or health outbreaks and emergencies could include prolonged travel restraints, more stringent shipment restraints, delays in product refining and smelting due to restrictions or temporary closures, other supply chain disruptions and workforce interruptions, including loss of life, and reputational damage in connection with challenges or reactions to action or perceived inaction by the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position. \n\nDamage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects. \n\nDamage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of a variety of events and circumstances, and could result in negative publicity (for example, with respect to handling of environmental, employee, safety and security matters, dealings with local community organizations or individuals, community commitments, handling of cultural sites or resources, and various other matters). \n\nWe have also provided greater transparency on environmental, social and governance performance in response to stakeholder engagement and requests in recent years, and provide supplemental disclosures in our Annual Sustainability Report and other sustainability reports on our website in connection with stakeholder concerns and issues. Such increased transparency may result in greater scrutiny and impact how the Company is perceived. \n\nOur Code of Conduct (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) forms the foundation of our internal governance structure as well as our commitment to responsible mining. We encourage employees and others to promptly report incidents of possible violations of the Code and/or our global policies and standards, including in the areas of business integrity, social and environmental, community relations and human rights. Employees and non-employees, including suppliers and community members, can anonymously report concerns via our third-party helpline. Each mine site has a complaints and grievances register to record matters raised by local stakeholders. When necessary, we use independent mechanisms agreed to by the complainants, such as a local leader or committee, to facilitate resolution of such matters before they require public or legal intervention. However, we are not always able to resolve these matters before they are raised publicly or in legal or regulatory proceedings and in the future we may not be able to meet the growing demands of stakeholders through these mechanisms. Such matters once publicized may negatively impact our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. \n\nThe growing use of social media to generate, publish and discuss community news and issues and to connect with others has made it significantly easier, among other things, for individuals and groups to share their opinions of us and our activities, whether true or not. We do not have direct control over how we are perceived by others and any resulting loss of reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. \n\nWe are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation, upgrade, operation and integration. \n\nWe are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems. The operating and control systems at our mines increasingly leverage technology-based solutions based on a combination of on-premises and cloud-based platforms. These systems are crucial for operating our mines safely and efficiently. Our systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, may be targeted by increasing ly sophisticated threat actors. These threat s include continually evolving cybersecurity risks from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, malware, computer viruses, cyber threats, extortion, employee error, malfeasance, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity risk is increasingly difficult to identify and quantify and cannot be fully mitigated because of the rapidly evolving nature of the threats, and the increasing sophistication of the threat actors. Additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems for company information through fraud or other means of deceiving our third-party service providers, employees or vendors. We have experienced attempts by external parties to compromise our networks and systems. For example, in 2020, we detected a cyberattack on our systems. Although we were able to respond quickly to stop the continued spread of the threat, it took significant time and resources to fully identify the scope of the attack and to recover our systems and data. The cost of responding to and remediating such event was immaterial. Although the 2020 attempts and other cyber incidents to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for preparing and protecting against such attempts and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient against future attacks. Any future material compromise or breach of our IT systems could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or \n\ncorruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions. Outages in our operational technology may affect operations related to health and safety and could result in putting lives at risk of harm or death. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cybersecurity attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm. Such efforts may prove insufficient to deter future cybersecurity attacks or prevent all security breaches. While we maintain general insurance, we no longer maintain specific insurance policies covering cybersecurity risk due to increased premium costs and restrictions to coverage, and, as such, any events for which we are not insured may results in additional costs and could affect our results of operations and financial position. \n\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. System modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. \n\nTo the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures, our interest in these properties is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures. \n\nTo the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures in the future, the existence or occurrence of one or more of the following circumstances and events could have a material adverse impact on our profitability or the viability of our interests held through joint ventures, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition: \n\n&#8226; inconsistent economic, political or business interests or goals between partners or disagreements with partners on strategy for the most efficient development or operation of mines; \n\n&#8226; inability to control certain strategic decisions made in respect of properties; \n\n&#8226; exercise of majority rights by our partners so as to take actions for which we may not believe to be in the joint venture&#8217;s best interests, including but not limited to decisions related to day to day operations, labor relations, litigation, government relations, political contributions, community relations, project approval and project funding mechanisms; \n\n&#8226; inability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations to the joint venture or third parties; and \n\n&#8226; litigation between partners regarding management, funding or other decisions related to the joint venture. \n\nTo the extent that we are not the operator of a joint venture properties, such that we will be unable to control the activities of the operator, the success of such operations will be beyond our control. In many cases we will be bound by the decisions made by the operator in the operation of such property, and will rely on the operator to manage the property and to provide accurate information related to such property. We can provide no assurance that all decisions of operators of properties we do not control will achieve the expected results. \n\nFor example, our joint ventures, including the joint venture that combines our and Barrick Gold Corporation&#8217;s (&#8220;Barrick&#8221;) respective Nevada operations, forming NGM, pursuant to the operating agreement entered into on July 1, 2019 between Barrick, Newmont and their wholly-owned subsidiaries party thereto (the &#8220;Nevada JV Agreement&#8221;), may not be as beneficial to us as expected, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, integration challenges, political risks, labor disputes or other factors. Pursuant to the terms of the Nevada JV Agreement, we hold a 38.5 percent economic interest and Barrick holds a 61.5 percent economic interest in NGM. Barrick operates NGM with overall management responsibility and is subject to the supervision and direction of NGM&#8217;s Board of Managers, which is comprised of three managers appointed by Barrick and two managers appointed by Newmont. Outside of certain prescribed matters, decisions of the Board of Managers will be determined by majority vote, with the managers appointed by each company having voting power in proportion to such company&#8217;s economic interests in NGM. Because we beneficially own less than a majority of the ownership and governance interests in NGM, we have limited control of NGM&#8217;s operations, and we depend on Barrick to operate NGM. In the event that Barrick has interests, objectives and incentives with respect to NGM that differ from our own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor. Any such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in NGM, the business of NGM or the portion of our growth strategy related to NGM. Additionally, to the extent NGM is subject to liabilities or litigation, we would be responsible for a proportional share of certain liabilities and/or NGM&#8217;s operations could be impacted, which could have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position. \n\nAdditionally, the Company is subject to certain funding requirements in connection with its joint ventures. Joint venture funding requirements, as well as the ability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations, may result in increases to our costs and required capital expenditures. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information including with respect to loan agreements with Pueblo Viejo. \n\nFinancial Risk \n\nIncreased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and capital controls may adversely affect Newmont&#8217;s costs, earnings and the value of some of our assets. \n\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the majority of our earnings and cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars. We conduct certain business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States. The foreign currencies that primarily affect our results of operations are the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. Our consolidated earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by movements in the exchange rates. Change in the value of the currencies of the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the Argentine Peso, the Ghana Cedi, the Chilean Peso or Surinamese Dollar versus the U.S. dollar could negatively impact our earnings. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and more information our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, see Foreign Currency Exchange Rates section in Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\nIn addition, from time to time, countries in which we operate adopt measures to restrict the availability of the local currency or the repatriation of capital across borders. These measures are imposed by governments or central banks, in some cases during times of economic instability, to prevent the removal of capital or the sudden devaluation of local currencies or to maintain in-country foreign currency reserves. In addition, many emerging market countries require consents or reporting processes before local currency earnings can be converted into U.S. dollars or other currencies and/or such earnings can be repatriated or otherwise transferred outside of the operating jurisdiction. These measures may have a number of negative effects on Newmont, reducing the immediately available capital that we could otherwise deploy for investment opportunities or the payment of expenses. In addition, measures that restrict the availability of the local currency or impose a requirement to operate in the local currency may create other practical difficulties for Newmont. For example, Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary environment with a cumulative inflation rate of over 100% for the last four years. In recent years, Argentina&#8217;s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency. These restrictions directly impact the timing of Cerro Negro's ability to remit cash from gold sales and pay interest and principal portions of intercompany debt to the Company. For more information, see Results of Consolidated Operations and Foreign Currency Exchange Rates sections in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. See also risk factors under the headings &#8220; Our operations in Argentina are susceptible to risk as a result of economic and political instability in Argentina and labor unrest &#8221;, &#8220; Our operations at Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana are subject to political, economic and other risks &#8221; and &#8220; Our Merian operation in Suriname is subject to political and economic risks &#8221; below. \n\nFuture funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, pay cash dividends or engage in share repurchase transactions. \n\nPotential future investments, including projects in the Company&#8217;s project pipeline, acquisitions and other investments, will require significant funds for capital expenditures. Depending on gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead prices, our operating cash flow may not be sufficient to meet all of these expenditures, depending on the timing of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities, and fund construction and operation of potential future projects. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it may be necessary or preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. However, U.S. and global markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions, For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and events related to the conflict and related sanctions in Ukraine, Russia and/or Belarus increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. Additional financing may not be commercially available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, any additional financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. In the event of lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt, fund share repurchase programs and transactions and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. See also the risk factor under the heading &#8220; Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends .&#8221; In addition, our joint venture partners may not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability in order to make their capital commitments. In the case that our partners do not make their economic commitments, the Company may be prevented from pursuing certain development opportunities or may assume additional financial obligations, which may require new sources of capital. \n\nOur long-lived assets and goodwill could become impaired, which could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. We also review our goodwill for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Management makes multiple assumptions in estimating future cash \n\nflows, which include production levels based on life of mine plans, future costs of production, estimates of future production levels based on value beyond proven and probable reserves at our operations, prices of metals, the historical experience of our operations and other factors. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating production levels of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead and the costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. We may be required to recognize material non-cash charges relating to impairments of long-lived assets and/or goodwill in the future if actual results differ materially from management&#8217;s estimates, which include metal prices, our ability to reduce or control production costs or capital costs through strategic mine optimization initiatives, increased costs or decreased production due to regulatory issues or if we do not realize the mineable reserves, resources or exploration potential at our mining properties. Additions to asset retirement costs could result in impairment charges. \n\nThe Company continues to evaluate strategic priorities and deployment of capital to projects in the pipeline. A decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project could result in a future impairment charge. For example, in response to the current challenging market conditions, which include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, in the third quarter of 2022 the Company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. The Company is currently in the process of assessing project plan options for the Yanacocha Sulfides project. The Company also periodically updates the economic model for its Conga project to understand changes to the estimated capital costs, cash flows, and economic returns from the project. Certain decisions or changes in circumstances could result in determinations that carrying value is not recoverable and could result in impairment. See Part II, Item 7 under the heading &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Carrying value of long-lived assets and Carrying value of Conga &#8221; for additional information. \n\nIf an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, or other favorable events occur. As a result of these uncertainties, our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the im pairment, and actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook. For additional information regarding goodwill, refer to Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income. \n\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on historical results of operations, forecasted cash flows from operations, and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. In the future, our estimates could change requiring a valuation allowance or impairment of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading &#8220;Income and Mining Taxes - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets&#8221; and Note 2 under the heading &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets&#8221; for additional information and factors that could impact the Company&#8217;s ability to realize the deferred tax assets. For additional information regarding Newmont&#8217;s non-current deferred tax assets, refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing. \n\nThere can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services or Moody&#8217;s Investors Service to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency&#8217;s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. The Company&#8217;s credit ratings have been subject to change over the years. We currently maintain a Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s rating of &#8220;BBB+&#8221; (stable outlook) and a Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rating of Baa1 (stable). We cannot make assurances regarding how long these ratings will remain unchanged or regarding the outcome of the rating agencies future reviews (including following any planned or future business combinations). A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and financial position. \n\nReturns for investments in pension plans are uncertain. \n\nWe maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The Company&#8217;s qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with IRS rules and regulations. The Company&#8217;s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading &#8220;Pension and Other Benefit Plans&#8221; for additional information regarding the funding status of qualified and non-qualified plans. The Company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market \n\nconditions and the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate. The ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions. \n\nRisks Related to Our Industry \n\nWe may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining. \n\nThe exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; Environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals; \n\n&#8226; Industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling and processing; \n\n&#8226; Accidents in connection with transportation, including transportation of chemicals, explosions or other materials, transportation of large mining equipment and transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites; \n\n&#8226; Social, community or labor force disputes resulting in work stoppages or shipping delays, such as at Pe&#241;asquito, Cerro Negro, Merian and Akyem, or related loss of social acceptance of community support; \n\n&#8226; Changes and/or increasingly stringent legal and regulatory requirements; \n\n&#8226; Delays in permitting due to reduced resources and capacity for review and formulation of permits at regulatory agencies; \n\n&#8226; Security incidents, including activities of illegal or artisanal miners, gold bullion or concentrate theft, including in transport, and corruption and fraud; \n\n&#8226; Shortages in materials or equipment and energy and electrical power supply interruptions or rationing; \n\n&#8226; Failure of unproven or evolving technologies or loss of information integrity or data; \n\n&#8226; Unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form); \n\n&#8226; Metallurgical conditions and gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and other metal recovery, including unexpected decline of ore grade; \n\n&#8226; Unanticipated changes in inventory levels at heap-leach operations; \n\n&#8226; Ground and surface water conditions; \n\n&#8226; Fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations; \n\n&#8226; Failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls; \n\n&#8226; Seismic activity; \n\n&#8226; Surface or underground fires or floods; and \n\n&#8226; Other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions, including those impacting operations or the ability to access and supply sites. \n\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities, development and production and closure of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. \n\nWe compete with other natural resource companies, and shortage of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects. \n\nWe compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment and supplies necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and other minerals. The mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules. We may be unable to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations. \n\nWe may be unable to obtain or retain necessary permits and leases, which could adversely affect our operations. \n\nOur mining and processing operations and development and exploration activities are subject to extensive permitting requirements. The requirements to obtain and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits can be costly and involve extended timelines. While we strive to obtain and comply with all permits required of us, there can be no assurance that we will obtain all such permits and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits at all times. Previously obtained permits may be suspended or revoked for a number of reasons, including through government or court action. Failure to obtain and/or comply with required permits can have serious consequences, including damage to our reputation; cessation of the development of a project; increased costs of development or production and litigation or regulatory action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. \n\nOur ability to obtain the required permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate near communities in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends in part on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to operate near certain communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, health and safety of communities in which we operate. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be adjusted in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations. Permit review and approval could be delayed, adversely impacting project implementation due to delays in review and development of permits from limited resources at the regulatory agencies. \n\nCertain of our mining and processing operations, including tailings storage, and project expansion and development activities require the lease of land, rights and properties. Obtaining and/or maintain and renewing lease arrangements can be costly, and no assurance can be provided that all necessary lease arrangements and renewals will be achieved or maintained at all times. For example, additional tailings capacity is needed to support future growth and sustainability of Boddington operations beyond 2025. Boddington&#8217;s existing tailings facility is expected to reach the permitted capacity in 2026. As the Company continues to work through incorporating the requirements of the GISTM, the life of mine tailings study has been re-initiated to explore options for tailings deposition. This study is due to be completed in 2023 and requires extensive environmental assessment. As such, the cost and viability of other options remains uncertain at this time. Further, the Boddington operation is primarily located on mining leases with renewal dates commencing in 2028 and no assurances can be provided that such renewals and additional lease scope for further tailings capacity will be secured at similar cost or at all. Failure to obtain necessary leases can have serious consequences, including cessation of operations and processing or the development of a project and/or increased costs, litigation or regulatory action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. See also the risk factors under the headings &#8220; Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability ,&#8221; and &#8220; Title to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or challenged &#8221;. \n\nMining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations. \n\nGreater scrutiny on the private sector broadly and multi-national companies specifically, to contribute to sustainable outcomes in the places where they operate, has led to a proliferation of standards and reporting initiatives focused on environmental stewardship, social performance and transparency. Extractive industries, and mining in particular, have seen significant increases in stakeholder expectations. These businesses are increasingly required to meaningfully engage with impacted stakeholders; understand and avoid or mitigate negative impacts while optimizing economic development and employment opportunities associated with their operations. The expectation is for companies to create shared value for shareholders, employees, governments, local communities and host countries. Such expectations tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have high socio-economic and environmental impacts. In response, Newmont has over many years developed and continues to evolve a robust system of ESG management that includes standards, guidance, assurance, participation in international organizations focused on improved performance and outcomes for host communities and the environment. In Ghana, for instance, in response to resettlement-related complaints, Newmont worked with national and local government authorities, traditional leaders, impacted farmers/landowners and other concerned stakeholders to analyze impacts, extend programs to support vulnerable households and provide enhanced livelihood support. Despite the Company&#8217;s commitment to on-going engagement with communities and stakeholders, no assurances can be provided that increased stakeholder expectations will not result in adverse financial and operational impacts to the business, including, without limitation, operational disruption, increased costs, increased investment obligations and increased taxes and royalties payable to governments. \n\nIllegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks. \n\nArtisanal and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, some of Newmont&#8217;s African and South American properties, including in Suriname and Ghana in recent years. For example, in Ghana in 2019, illegal miners attacked a field team of security guards employed by a security contractor, tragically resulting in a fatality. Illegal mining, which involves trespass into the development or operating area of the mine, is both a security and safety issue, which may present a security threat to property and human life. The illegal miners from time to time have clashed with security staff and law enforcement personnel who have attempted to move them \n\naway from the facilities. Although, under certain circumstances, artisanal mining may be a legally sanctioned activity, artisanal mining is also associated with a number of negative impacts, including environmental degradation, poor working practices, erosion of civil society, human rights abuse and funding of conflict. The environmental, social, safety and health impacts of artisanal and illegal mining are frequently attributed to formal large scale mining activity, and it is often assumed that artisanally-mined gold is channeled through large-scale mining operators, even though artisanal and large-scale miners normally have separate and distinct supply chains. These misconceptions impact negatively on the reputation of the industry. The activities of the illegal miners could cause damage to Newmont&#8217;s properties or result in inappropriate or unlawful use of force for which Newmont could potentially be held responsible. The presence of illegal miners could lead to exploration and project delays and disputes regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits. Illegal mining and theft could also result in lost gold production and reserves, mine and development stoppages, and have a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations or project development. \n\nCivil disturbances and criminal activities can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability. \n\nCivil disturbances and criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, sabotage, theft, blockades, organized crime and vandalism may cause disruptions and could result in the suspension of operations, delays to project development and negative impacts on exploration activities at certain sites. Incidents of such activities have occasionally led to conflict with security personnel and/or police, which in some cases resulted in injuries including in Ghana, Peru, Mexico and Suriname. Additionally, some areas in which we conduct operations, develop projects and exploration activities are affected by persistent violence and organized crime involving significant drug cartels, such as in Mexico. \n\nAlthough security measures have been implemented by the Company to protect employees, community members, property and assets, such measures will not guarantee that such civil disturbances and criminal activities will not continue to occur in the future, or result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, decrease operational efficiency or construction delays, increase community tensions or result in liabilities or reputational harm to Newmont. Security incidents, in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our operations, development projects, exploration and reclamation activities, especially if criminal activity and violence continue to escalate. Such incidents may halt or delay production, increase operating costs; result in harm to employees, contractors, visitors or community members; decrease operational efficiency due to employee absenteeism and other factors; increase community tensions or otherwise adversely affect our ability to conduct business. The manner in which the Company&#8217;s personnel, national police or other security forces respond to civil disturbances and criminal activities can give rise to additional risks where those responses are not conducted in a manner consistent with international and Newmont standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights. Newmont takes seriously our obligation to respect and promote human rights, is a signatory to and active participant in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and has adopted a Sustainability and Stakeholder Engagement Policy and Human Rights Standard in-line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Nonetheless, although the Company has implemented a number of significant measures and safeguards which are intended to ensure that personnel understand and uphold these standards, the implementation of these measures will not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. The evolving expectations related to human rights, indigenous rights, and environmental protections may result in opposition to our current and future operations, the development of new projects and mines, and exploration activities. Such opposition may take the form of legal or administrative proceedings or manifestations such as protests, roadblocks or other forms of public expression against our activities, and may have a negative impact on our local or global reputation and operations. Opposition by community and activist groups to our operations may require modification of, or preclude the operation or development of, our projects and mines or may require us to enter into agreements with such groups or local governments with respect to our projects and mines or exploration activities, in some cases, causing increased costs and significant delays to the advancement of our projects. For example, in Peru, our Conga project faced opposition from anti-mining activists, after which we suspended construction on the project&#8217;s mining facilities and eventually reclassified Conga&#8217;s reserves to resource as the result of certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015. The failure to conduct operations in accordance with Company standards can result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, increase community tensions, reputational harm to Newmont or result in criminal and/or civil liability and/or financial damages or penalties. \n\nOur operations face substantial regulation of health and safety. \n\nOur operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations governing worker health and safety across our operating regions and our failure to comply with applicable legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. \n\nOur mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under local mining regulations. If inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. \n\nIn addition to potential government restrictions and regulatory fines, penalties or sanctions, our ability to operate (including the effect of any impact on our workforce) and thus, our results of operations and our financial position (including because of potential related fines and sanctions), could be adversely affected by accidents, injuries, fatalities or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate. \n\nOur operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. \n\nOur exploration, development, mining and processing operations, and closed facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous and non-hazardous waste management and reclamation. Many of the countries in which we operate have laws and regulations related to water (quality and quantity), nature and greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG\") emissions which are becoming increasingly more stringent. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, failure to obtain or renew, or cancellation of, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our operations and closure processes. Increased global attention or regulation on consumption of shared resources and use products or development of waste that have the potential to impact human health and the environment could similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs. \n\nOur operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy. \n\nClimate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy is expected to impact Newmont in a number of ways. Producing gold is an energy-intensive business, currently resulting in a significant carbon footprint. Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy will require significant investment and may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. Depending on the nature, speed, focus and jurisdiction of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to the business. \n\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (&#8220;UNFCC&#8221;) held in Paris in 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted which was intended to govern emission reductions beyond 2020. Newmont supports the UNFCC goal of limiting global warming to &#8220;well below 2 o C&#8221; compared to pre-industrial levels and plans to transition its operations to meet this goal by 2030, with an aspiration of carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2020, Newmont also announced plans to significantly invest in climate change initiatives in support of this goal, and additional material investments and capital expenditures will be required in order to meet our climate targets in the future. Inconsistent implementation or significant delay in the implementation of country-level policy related to the Paris Agreement and enhanced framework objectives announced at the most recent annual UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP27) in November 2022 are likely to increase the risk for future regulatory impacts and rapid shifts to low-carbon technologies. \n\nPolicy and regulatory risk related to actual and proposed changes in climate- and water-related laws, regulations and taxes developed to regulate the transition to a low-carbon economy may result in increased costs for our operations, venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Regulatory uncertainty may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than originally estimated for new development projects and operations, including closure reclamation obligations. For example, operational and capital expenses are expected to increase in order to meet renewable portfolio standard requirements by 50% or greater from current costs over the next 10 years in Australia, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Carbon taxes, fuel switching and the transition to cleaner purchased power and/or on-site renewable energy generation will require significant upfront capital expenditures and may also increase operating costs. As another example, the carbon tax in Canada of C$30/tonne of CO 2 increased to C$50/tonne in 2022, impacting operating costs at our Canadian operations. We expect the potential for similar tax increases in other jurisdictions. Additionally, we do not maintain insurance policies against such climate-related risks or taxes. \n\nThe development and deployment of technological improvements or innovations will be required to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, which could result in write-offs and early retirement of existing assets, increased costs to adopt and deploy new practices and processing including planning and design for mines, development of alternative power sources, site level efficiencies and other capital investments. We will also consider the limited use of carbon offsets to support meeting our 2050 carbon neutral goal by neutralizing hard to abate residual emissions. \n\nThere will be varied and complex market impacts due to climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. There will be shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products and services in connection with evolving consumer and investor sentiments. Market perceptions of the mining sector, and, in particular, the role that certain metals will or will not play in the transition to a low-carbon economy remains uncertain. Potential financial impacts may include reduced investment in gold due to shift in investor sentiment, increased production costs due to changing input prices, re-pricing of land valuation and assets, increased global competition for key materials needed for new technologies (lithium, copper, rare earth minerals used in solar technology, etc.), potential cost increases by insurers and lenders, and potential increases in taxation of the mining and metals sector. \n\nShould the mining and metals sector not respond quickly enough to meeting globally accepted science-based reductions required to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change, industry members may be subject to an increased risk of future climate litigation. In the U.S. and Canada, lawsuits have been filed against oil and gas companies to assign liability for climate-related impacts. Over time, litigation may also apply to other resource intensive sectors that fail to set and/or meet long-term reduction targets. While \n\nthe Company is not currently subject to any lawsuits related to climate, no assurances can be provided that similar suits will not be brought in the future. \n\nA failure to meet our climate strategy commitments and/or societal or investor expectations could also result in damage to our reputation, decreased investor confidence and challenges in maintaining positive community relations, which can pose additional obstacles to our ability to conduct our operations and develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects. Further, the Company&#8217;s financing strategy is tied to its ESG commitments. The interest rate of Newmont&#8217;s $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.600% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2032 (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) is linked to Newmont&#8217;s performance against key ESG commitments regarding 2030 emissions reduction targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles target. The interest rate margin of Newmont&#8217;s $3.0 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility is also subject to adjustment based on the Company&#8217;s ESG scores. As such, a failure to meet our climate and sustainability targets can result in further expense and impact our liquidity and financial condition. \n\nOur targets are uniquely tailored to our business, operations and capabilities, which do not easily lend to benchmarking against similar sustainability performance targets, and the related performance, of other companies. We will review our targets and sustainability framework from time to time, which may result in amendments in the future. Newmont may choose to adopt more ambitious targets in the future in connection with evolving best practices and market demand, which may be increasingly challenging and costly to achieve. Additionally, the methodologies that we use to calculate our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions may change over time based upon changing industry standards, which may impact, positively or negatively, our ability to satisfy our targets, which could in turn adversely affect our reputation. Any major acquisition, merger, consolidation or divestiture or any series of related acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or divestitures by or involving us may impact our ability to achieve our targets and commitments. There is currently no generally accepted global definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what criteria qualify as, &#8220;green,&#8221; &#8220;social,&#8221; &#8220;sustainable&#8221; or &#8220;sustainability-linked&#8221; (and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time), and therefore no assurance is or can be given that Newmont will meet any or all investor expectations. \n\nOur operations are subject to a range of transitional and physical risks related to climate change. \n\nWe believe that climate change has the potential to impact the regions and sites in which Newmont operates, as well as the surrounding communities. Long-term potential physical climate risks include, but are not limited to, higher temperature in all regions, higher intensity storm events in all regions, impacts to annual precipitation depending upon the latitude and proximity of the site to oceans, and more extreme heat for sites near the equator or in Australia. \n\nPhysical risks related to extreme weather events such as extreme precipitation, flooding, longer wet or dry seasons, increased temperatures and drought, landslides, wildfires or brushfires, or more severe storms may have financial implications for the business. For example, we experienced severe flooding in early 2017 at our Tanami mine in Australia which led to shutdown of operations for several weeks. In 2019, Tanami completed the construction of a natural gas pipeline to deliver fuel to the site to replace diesel fuel that is trucked to the site on roads that regularly flood due to increasing seasonal rainfall. Our operations in Suriname and Peru have also experienced delays in the connection with the delivery of key production supplies due to temporary flooding. There is also the potential for disruption to transport routes associated with the distribution of our products. Severe storm events can also result in unpermitted off-site discharges, slope instability, mine pit erosion and structural failures, tailings storage facility overtopping and other impacts, including water storage and treatment facility capacity considerations. Extended dry seasons or unseasonal dry conditions could exacerbate dust generation from operating activities that may require additional controls for continued operation or result in compliance breaches. Changing climatic conditions may also affect the likelihood of meeting closure success criteria and require adjustments to mine site rehabilitation and closure plans. The higher potential for extreme heat conditions may affect equipment efficiency. For additional information, see risk factors under the headings &#8220; Our operations are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies and subject to water-related risks &#8221; and &#8220; Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.&#8221; \n\nSuch events can temporarily slow or halt operations due to physical damage to assets, reduced worker productivity for safety protocols on site related to extreme temperatures or lightening events, worker aviation and bus transport to or from the site, and local or global supply route disruptions that may limit transport of essential materials, chemicals and supplies, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Additional financial impacts could include increased capital or operating costs to increase water storage and treatment capacity, obtain or develop maintenance and monitoring technologies, increase resiliency of facilities and establish supplier climate resiliency and contingency plans. \n\nAn increase in frequency and duration of extreme weather conditions can be followed by extended power outages. Energy disruptions can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to production delays or additional costs to ensure business continuity through reliable sources of on-site power generation. Energy transmission and supply may be impacted by wildfires, such as those that occurred in Australia in 2020, which may interrupt electrical power transmission lines to mine sites, and that may pose risks to on-site facilities and energy generators, fuel dispensing systems and supplies. In jurisdictions that rely on purchased hydroelectric power, such as in Ghana and Peru, extreme drought and extended dry seasons may impact the electric utility&#8217;s \n\nwater supplies needed to generate hydroelectric power purchased by the mine to run operations, which would result in higher costs and/or limit energy availability for continuity of operations as well as impact our environmental systems and processes. \n\nOur Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability. \n\nNewmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and hydrogeological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced geotechnical failures (such as pit wall and slope failures) at some of our mines, including, without limitation, at our operations in Australia, Ghana, Peru, Canada, Colorado and at NGM, in Nevada. See also the risk factor under the heading &#8220; Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations &#8221;. \n\nUnanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions, may occur. For example, seismic activity, such as seismic activity experienced at our &#201;l&#233;onore mine, surface or underground fires, floods, landslides and pit wall failures, can be difficult to predict. Such conditions are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Such events may not be detected in advance. \n\nIn addition, Newmont has both operational (active and inactive) and closed tailings storage facilities (\"TSFs\") in a variety of climatic and geographic settings. Annually, Newmont manages and disposes more than 100 million tonnes of milled rock slurry, referred to as tailings, that are placed within engineered, surface containment facilities, or placed as structural backfill paste in underground mines. Newmont has experienced seepage at site TSFs in the past which required us to re-evaluate our emergency response systems and make facility and storage modifications. TSF seepage or failures event could occur in the future. The failure of a TSF embankment or a water storage dam at one of our mine sites could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. For example, in early 2019, the extractive industry experienced a large-scale tailings dam failure at an unaffiliated mine in Brazil, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property, environmental and reputational damage. Recognizing this risk, Newmont continues to review our existing practices and supported the International Council on Mining &#38; Metals and the co-convenors in development of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (&#8220;GISTM&#8221;). Newmont is committed to the implementation of the GISTM. We are working to bring our priority facilities (those with 'very high' or 'extreme' consequence classification) in conformance by August 2023, and all other TSFs are expected to be in conformance with the GISTM in the second half of 2025. Compliance with the GISTM remains on-going and has and may continue to result in increases to our estimated sustaining costs and closure costs for existing facilities. Despite these efforts, no assurance can be given that TSF failure events will not occur in the future. \n\nA geotechnical failure of a TSF, dam, or pit slope could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, regulatory actions or penalties, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs and other impacts, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See also the risk factors under the heading &#8220; We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining &#8221; and &#8220;Damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects .&#8221; \n\nOur operations may be adversely affected by rising energy prices or energy shortages. \n\nOur mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long-distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical supply networks. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations. \n\nOur principal energy sources are purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal. Increasing global demand for energy, concerns about nuclear power and the limited growth of new energy sources are affecting the price and supply of energy. A variety of factors, including higher energy usage in emerging market economies, actual and proposed taxation of carbon emissions as well as concerns surrounding unrest and the war in Ukraine and conflict elsewhere, could result in increased demand or limited supply of energy and/or sharply escalating diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and other energy prices. Availability of renewable power sources or conflicting government regulations, such as the proposed reform of the energy market in Mexico, may have an impact on our ability to meet our reduction targets with a specific timeline. Changes in energy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, restrictions on energy supply and increased energy prices could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flow. \n\nAs our operations move to reduce our GHG emissions, power sources and technology at our operations will continue to be evaluated and implemented. Such transitions are likely to require capital expenditures and may result in additional costs. Certain of our operations may also become more dependent upon access to electrical power supply as certain mines advance projects aimed at the electrification of large haulage fleets. The availability to access renewable power (with greater competition) and the readiness of \n\ntechnology to support decarbonization with the timeframe of the 2030 and 2050 targets remains subject to uncertainties, which could impact ability to achieve targets. See the risk factor above under the heading &#8220; Our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy &#8221;. \n\nOur operations are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies and subject to water-related risks. \n\nWe recognize the right to clean, safe water and that reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. Water is also critical to our business, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our management approach. We have set annual water efficiency targets at each of our operating sites. Additionally, we aim to achieve ambitious long-term water stewardship actions, which integrate our operations and value chain and support collective management of water through external partnerships and collaborations. A failure to meet our water targets and/or societal or investor expectations could also result in damage to our reputation, decreased investor confidence and challenges in maintaining positive community relations, which can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects. \n\nAcross the globe, water is a shared and regulated resource. Newmont operates in areas where watersheds are under stress with limited supply, increasing population and water demand, and impacted water in various forms. Increasing pressure on water use may occur due to in-migration of communities and increased populations in proximity to our operations. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights, claims and contracts to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings or community negotiations relating to our water rights, claims, contracts and uses. \n\nWater shortages and surplus may also result from weather or climate impacts outside of the Company&#8217;s control. Changes in the quantity of water, whether in excess or deficient amounts, may impact exploration and development activities, mining and processing operations, water management and treatment facilities, tailings storage facilities, closure and reclamation efforts, and may increase levels of dust in dry conditions and land erosion and slope stability in case of prolonged wet conditions. Our Pe&#241;asquito and CC&#38;V operations are situated in areas with high baseline water stress. CC&#38;V in Colorado must purchase water supply in order to meet site needs and augmentation requirements. Pe&#241;asquito in Mexico takes its water supply from the Cedros Aquifer which has limited and declining yield as it is located in a dry and arid area that is prone to drought, and also is relied upon by nearby communities as a water supply for drinking water and agriculture. The water supply at Pe&#241;asquito is thus subject to a significant degree of regulatory and community scrutiny, and Pe&#241;asquito has made long-term commitments to provide safe community water supplies. Seasonality and changes in the levels of rainfall can also impact our operations. For example, in January 2023, our Tanami site in Australia experienced unexpected and significant rain resulting in flooding and road closure limiting our ability to get supplies to the site, causing mill backup and impacts to production. Similarly, at Boddington in Australia severe weather and heavy rainfall at Boddington caused delays and impacted productivity the third quarter of 2021 and 2022. There is also a risk at Boddington that extended below average rainfall or the occurrence of drought in southwest Australia could impact raw water supply for the site. While we have incorporated systems to address the impact of the dry season and water shortages as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions. \n\nIncreased precipitation and severe storm events may potentially impact tailings storage facilities in the future by exceeding water management capacity, overtopping the facility, and/or undermining the geotechnical stability of the structure. We have experienced impacts at various sites in recent years due to heavy rainfall and severe storms. For example, in 2022, Yanacocha experienced heavy rainfall, above average historical levels, which resulted in significant water balance stress and required active emergency management. Refer to Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Environmental Matters - Minera Yanacocha S.R.L , for additional information. Increased amounts of water may also result in flooding of mine pits, maintenance and storage facilities; or may exceed current water management and treatment capacity to store and treat water, physical conditions resulting in an unintended overflow and discharge either on or off of the mine site property. See the risk factor above under the heading &#8220; Our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy &#8221; for additional information. \n\nOperations have identified seepage from infrastructure (tailings, waste rock and seepage) that may have an impact on groundwater. We are currently managing this risk through monitoring, collection and treatment systems. There is a risk that the seepage could have an impact on beneficial use of groundwater resulting in increased requirements for collection and treatment as well as the potential requirement to provide alternative water sources. See also the risk factor under the heading &#8220; Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.&#8221; \n\nLaws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in closure are becoming increasingly stringent. For example, at our Pe&#241;asquito operation, regulators have asserted non-conformance of water wells and subsequent use of ground water. A failure to resolve such allegations of non-compliance with regulators could result in loss of permits and restriction of such wells, which could impact our ability to operate the site. We are also seeing increasingly stringent regulations of surface and groundwater at a number of our sites resulting in increased monitoring and potentially the need for pump back systems and treatment in the future. New requirements and regulation have resulted or may result in increased costs and could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flows in the future. \n\nFor more information on the Company&#8217;s reclamation and remediation liabilities, refer to Notes 5 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the risk factor under the heading &#8220; Mine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.&#8221; \n\nRisks Related to the Jurisdictions in Which We Operate \n\nOur operations are subject to risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions. \n\nExploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions, including: \n\n&#8226; Potential instability of foreign governments and changes in government policies, including relating to or in response to changes of U.S. laws or foreign policies; \n\n&#8226; Expropriation or nationalization of property; \n\n&#8226; Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds; \n\n&#8226; Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold and other metals offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts; \n\n&#8226; Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold, silver, copper, zinc and/or lead; \n\n&#8226; Disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory; \n\n&#8226; Royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, the State of Colorado and the State of Nevada in the U.S.; \n\n&#8226; Changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in changes resulting from changes in political administrations; \n\n&#8226; Risk of increased taxation related to impacts to government revenue as a result of challenging socioeconomic conditions, including recessions and/or in connection with heath and community emergencies, such as COVID-19 and other pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks; \n\n&#8226; Fines, fees, and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate; \n\n&#8226; Risk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations; \n\n&#8226; Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights; \n\n&#8226; Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals; \n\n&#8226; Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism; \n\n&#8226; Claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities; \n\n&#8226; Risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, blockade, local artisanal or illegal mining, organized crime by drug cartels, theft and vandalism; \n\n&#8226; Delays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements; \n\n&#8226; Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act; \n\n&#8226; Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located; \n\n&#8226; Increased financing costs; \n\n&#8226; Currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation; \n\n&#8226; Foreign exchange controls; \n\n&#8226; Increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington operation where use of alternative ports is not currently economical, or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects; \n\n&#8226; Risk of disruption, damage or failure of information technology systems, and risk of loss and operational delays due to impacts to operational technology systems, such as due to cyber-attacks, malicious software computer viruses, security breaches, design failures and natural disasters; \n\n&#8226; Risk of loss due to disease, such as malaria or the zika virus, and other potential medical endemic or pandemic issues, such as Ebola or COVID-19, as a result of the potential related impact to employees, disruption to operations, supply chain delays, trade restrictions and impact on economic activity in affected countries or regions; and \n\n&#8226; Disadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues. \n\nConsequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. \n\nNew or changing legislation and tax risks in certain operating jurisdictions could negatively affect us. \n\nWe have operations and conduct business in a number of jurisdictions, which may increase our susceptibility to sudden tax changes. For instance, a 12% export duty was imposed by the Argentine government in 2018, revised down to 8% thereafter, which could affect our Argentine operations. In the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, a local procurement law was passed in 2021 requiring extractive industries to procure at least 50% of their goods and services from registered local providers, which could further impact our operational results. In the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, environmental taxes became effective in 2017 with little clarity on how the taxes are to be calculated. An ecological tax agreement was ratified in 2021 which provides clarity for 2021 to 2024, after which, the Company, along with other companies in the State of Zacatecas, will need to engage with governmental authorities to understand how the environmental tax would be levied year-over-year. Also, in Mexico, a 2021 tax reform bill proposed federal fees on revenue generated from mining which could impact our operations if passed. Furthermore, a new Economic Plan for 2022 (the \"Proposal\") was enacted. While the changes under the Proposal are not substantive in nature (in the sense that they do not create new taxes or increase applicable rates), they may increase the future cost of our compliance and pose additional uncertainties in application of the law. In the United States, at the federal and state level, regulatory changes which may be implemented in the area of tax reform remain uncertain and may adversely affect companies in the mining sector. For example, NGM could be impacted by the resolutions before the State of Nevada Legislature to amend the State Constitution to increase mining taxes. An example of this was the passing of Assembly Bill 495 in 2021 that results in a new excise tax on mining companies engaged in the business of extracting gold and silver in the state of Nevada. Taxation laws and other regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, subject to varying interpretations and applications by the relevant tax authorities and subject to changes and revisions in the ordinary course. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to regulations will be passed or to what extend they will impact the Company. Any additional and/or unexpected taxes imposed on us could have a material and adverse impact on our Company. See also the risk factor under the heading &#8220; Our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy &#8221; for a discussion of uncertainties and potential tax increases in connection with climate change considerations. \n\nChanges in mining or investment policies or shifts in political and social attitudes in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our operations or profitability. \n\nOur operations may be affected in a number of ways by laws and regulations related, but not limited to: restrictions on production; price controls; export controls; import restrictions, such as restrictions applicable to, among other things, equipment, services and supplies, currency remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of mineral claims, environmental legislation, land use, surface land access, land claims of local communities, water use, and mine safety. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as partners with carried or other interests, any of which may adversely affect our operations or profitability. \n\nIn addition, as governments continue to struggle with deficits and concerns over the potential and actual effects of depressed economic conditions (including in connection with COVID-19 impacts), many of them have targeted the mining and metals sector in order to raise revenue. Governments are continually assessing the fiscal terms of the economic rent for a mining company to exploit resources in their countries. Numerous countries have implemented changes to their mining regimes that reflect increased government control over or participation in the mining sector, including, but not limited to, changes of law affecting foreign ownership and takeovers, mandatory government participation in mining enterprises, taxation and royalties, working conditions, rates of exchange, exchange controls, exploration licensing, export duties, requirements to sell to the government, repatriation of income or return of capital, environmental protection, as well as requirements intended to boost the local economy, including usage of local goods and employment of local and community staff or contractors, among other benefits to be provided to local residents. The effects of the various requirements and uncertainties related to the economic risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Some concern exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position. \n\nOur operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks. \n\nMinera Yanacocha S.R.L. (&#8220;Yanacocha&#8221;), including the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. While recently roadblocks and protests have diminished and focused on local political activism and labor disputes, we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect the Conga Project&#8217;s development, other new projects in the area and the continued operation of Yanacocha. \n\nConstruction activities on our Conga project were suspended in 2011, at the request of Peru&#8217;s central government following protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project was reviewed by independent experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. This review concluded that the environmental impact assessment complied with international standards and provided recommendations to improve water management. Based on the Company's internal project portfolio evaluation process, we have reprioritized other projects ahead of the Conga project, and therefore do not anticipate developing Conga in the next ten years. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the project&#8217;s development timeline, we have allocated our exploration and development capital to other projects in our portfolio. As a result, the Conga project is currently in care and maintenance and we will continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the Conga project. Should the Company be unable to develop the Conga project or conclude that future development is not in the best interest of the business, a future impairment charge may result. \n\nThe prior Central Government of Peru supported responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of Peru. However, following the presidential election in 2021, there has been considerable political unrest in Peru. In a close and contested election, Pedro Castillo was declared the president-elect of Peru in July 2021, which resulted in a period of protests, unrest and uncertainty around the political and social environment in Peru and Cajamarca. Amidst political turmoil and instability, Castillo made numerous changes to his cabinet, including ministers of mining, work and interior, and of prime ministers. Castillo was ultimately removed from office in late 2022 due to his attempt to dissolve the legislative body and install an emergency government. Political turmoil and division has continued in Peru as protest and demonstrations against the current President Dina Boluarte escalated in early 2023 resulting in clashes with security forces and violence. \n\nThe current Central Government&#8217;s legislative priorities and support for responsible mining in Peru remains uncertain. Previous regional governments of Cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed certain mining projects in the past, including by protests, community demands and road blockages, which may occur again in the future. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken by the Central or regional government and neighboring communities in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect current operations and new projects at Yanacocha or Conga. Risks related to mining and foreign investment under the new administration include, without limitation, risks to mining concessions, land tenure and permitting, increased taxes and royalties, nationalization of mining assets and increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, the inability to develop Conga or operate or expand at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth and production in the region. See also the risk factor under the heading &#8220; Mine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made&#8221; and refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Company&#8217;s interest in Yanacocha. \n\nOur Merian operation in Suriname is subject to political and economic risks. \n\nWe hold a 75% interest in the Merian gold mine (&#8220;Merian&#8221;) in the mid-eastern part of Suriname. Suriname has experienced political instability and uncertainty in the past which may continue in future years. Suriname is faced with high debts to foreign creditors, significant inflation rates and has experienced a hyperinflationary economy. Significant devaluation of the Surinamese dollar against the U.S. dollar in recent years has resulted in an increase of the prices of certain goods and services within Suriname, including without limitation, the price of fuel, which had been subsidized by successive governments. The government of Suriname recently passed a new law to introduce Value Added Tax, which came into effect on January 1, 2023 and has drastically increased the cost of living and negatively impacts the purchasing power of the residents of Suriname, including our employees. These impacts and negative economic trends can cause social unrest, which may present risks for our operations in Suriname. \n\nOperations and development in Suriname are governed by a mineral agreement with the Republic of Suriname. The mineral agreement was approved by parliament and requires approval by parliament to change. However, in 2021, the government made requests for prepayment of taxes and special solidarity payments in light of budgetary concerns, it is possible that the government may request changes to the mineral agreement in the future. While the government is generally considered by the Company to be mining friendly, it is possible that the current or future government may adopt substantially different policies, make changes in taxation treatment or regulations, take arbitrary action which might halt operations, increase costs, or otherwise impact mining and exploration rights and/or permits, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and/or financial condition. \n\nThe government of Suriname previously exercised an option to participate in a fully-funded 25 percent equity ownership stake in Merian. Suriname manages its participation through Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (&#8220;Staatsolie&#8221;), a Surinamese corporation with the Republic of Suriname as sole shareholder. If Staatsolie does not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability to make their capital commitments in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement our operations in Suriname could be impacted. See the risk factor under the heading &#8220; Future funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pay cash dividends or our ability to engage in share repurchase transactions. &#8221; earlier in this section under &#8220;Risks Related to Our Business&#8221;. \n\nOur operations at Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana are subject to political, economic and other risks. \n\nNewmont operates in Ghana pursuant to a Revised Investment Agreement ratified by Ghana&#8217;s Parliament in 2015, which established a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for Newmont operations in Ghana. The financial and tax stability periods established by such agreements expire as early as 2025 for Ahafo and 2027 for Akyem. The Republic of Ghana has experienced worsening socioeconomic conditions in recent years. The Ghanaian cedi has experienced significant depreciation with inflation accelerating to 54.1% at the end of 2022. Ghana&#8217;s credit rating worsened to speculative grade, at near default to default levels, as the Ghanaian Finance Ministry announced suspension of debt service payments in December 2022 on the majority of its external debt, including commercial and bilateral loans, and that Ghana was seeking to restructure its debt. Efforts in early 2023 to put in place a domestic debt exchange program have faced setbacks from pension funds and by individual bond holders leading to amended terms. Continued economic recession and/or unfavorable macroeconomic indicators have also resulted in pressures from the Government of Ghana to obtain more revenue and benefits from mining companies on the back of anti-mining sentiment and perceived inequities that the industry is not contributing its fair share. To address budgetary deficits, the Government of Ghana has in the past, and is expected in 2023, to initiate measures to generate additional revenue from the mining industry and other sectors of the economy as it attempts to increase revenue collection through various tax audits and investigations, proposed new fees, increased revenue and tax initiatives and other vehicles, such as the proposed Growth and Stabilization Levy as well as new local content regulation. Other risks include impacts to supply chain, restrictions and local procurement requirements, increase in key commodity prices, more restrictive local banking requirements including requirements for repatriation of proceeds to banks domiciled in Ghana, limitations on capacity of banks to provide reclamation bonds, requests for further local employment requirements, requests for contract renegotiation and increases in contract rates and other costs. Additionally, the government may grant artisanal mining rights or alternative mining rights, such as sand and gravel, in locations in which the Company has land rights, but no active operations, impacting the Company&#8217;s non-operational land positions. Economic setbacks and anti-mining sentiment can also result in an increase in community frustration and friction with artisanal small-scale mining resulting in conflicts, which can negatively impact our operations in Ghana. \n\nOur operations in Argentina are susceptible to risk as a result of economic and political instability in Argentina and labor unrest. \n\nThere continue to be risks relating to the uncertain and unpredictable political and economic environment in Argentina, especially at the provincial level in Santa Cruz where our Cerro Negro mine is located. Inflation remains a challenge in Argentina and Argentina&#8217;s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in 2019 and 2020 in an effort to stabilize the local currency. For information on Argentina&#8217;s foreign currency controls and their effect on our operations, see the section titled &#8220;Foreign Currency Exchange Rates&#8221; in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Maintaining operating revenues in Argentine pesos could expose us to the risks of peso devaluation and high domestic inflation. \n\nIn recent years, we experienced work stoppages by miners represented by unions at the Cerro Negro Mine. Disruptions may arise again in the future with the unions at the Cerro Negro mine or with the local communities and unions that could adversely affect access to, and operations at, the Cerro Negro Mine. \n\nRisks Related to Our Workforce \n\nOur business depends on good relations with our employees. \n\nProduction at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stops or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. For example, in recent years, there have been work stoppages by miners represented by unions at our Cerro Negro and Merian mines, which have disrupted operations. At December 31, 2022, various unions represented approximately 33% of our employee workforce worldwide. In 2022, Newmont implemented a new employment model in Ghana converting permanent employees into two-year fixed term contracts. Although 99.8% of eligible employees accepted the new fixed term contract and, received severance for their years of service, following implementation of the new employment model, the two unions requested and were granted a new collective bargaining certificates from Ghana&#8217;s Chief Labor Officer. Both certificates have been placed on hold to engage in proper process in accordance with Ghana&#8217;s Labor laws, and until Newmont and the unions agree on the class of workers to be represented. The outcome of that engagement and whether such certificates will be granted remains to be determined. In Peru, our two labor agreements expire in 2026 and 2027. In Suriname, the previous labor agreement held with the union for our Merian mine expired in 2021, and negotiations remain in progress. In Argentina where there are two unions; one union has an expired agreement under negotiation and another has an agreement in place until 2024. In Timmins, Ontario, we renegotiated a three-year collective bargaining agreement for our Porcupine mine with the United Steelworkers Union which will be in effect through \n\nOctober 2023. In Mexico, following negotiations, we reached a profit sharing agreement in 2022 whereby union represented workforce will participate in uncapped profit-sharing bonus up to 10%, which will result in increased labor costs in the future. A failure to successfully enter into new contracts or resolve ongoing union complaints could result in future labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Future disputes at the Company&#8217;s operations, projects or joint ventures may not be resolved without disruptions. \n\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to perform their jobs in a safe and respectful work environment. \n\nWe depend upon the services of a number of key executives and management personnel. Our success is also dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to execute on our strategy. We are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated fairly, with dignity, decency, respect and in accordance with all applicable laws. We recognize that bullying, sexual harassment and harassment based on other protected categories, including race, have been prevalent in every industry, including the mining industry. Features of the mining industry, such as being a historically hierarchical and male-dominated culture, create risk factors for harmful workplace behavior. While we do not tolerate discrimination and harassment of any kind (including but not limited to sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, age, or disability, among others), our policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential harmful workplace behaviors. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in harmful behaviors and improper, inappropriate or unlawful conduct, including but not limited to bullying, discrimination and harassment. If the Company fails to maintain a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment, it could impact our ability to retain talent and maintain a diverse workforce and damage the Company&#8217;s reputation. There continues to be competition over highly skilled personnel in our industry. If we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. \n\nOur business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience periods where our employees are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19), our operations could be adversely affected. See the risk factor under the heading &#8220;Our operations and business have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future.&#8221; In addition to physical safety, protecting the psychological safety of our employees is necessary to maintaining a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment. If the Company fails to maintain a safe environment that is free of harassment, discrimination or bullying, it could adversely impact employee engagement, performance and productivity, result in potential legal claims and/or damage the Company&#8217;s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s market value. See also the risk factor under the heading \" Damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects .&#8221; \n\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects. \n\nA significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including: \n\n&#8226; Negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms; \n\n&#8226; New legislation limiting or altering the ability to utilize contractors or outsourced resources; \n\n&#8226; The inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement; \n\n&#8226; Reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor; \n\n&#8226; Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement; \n\n&#8226; Interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events; \n\n&#8226; Failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and \n\n&#8226; Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues; \n\n&#8226; Liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. \n\nIn addition, law and regulations relating to the use of contractors may vary in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and changes in legal and regulatory restrictions may also impact our ability to utilize contractors and outsourcing services. For example, \n\nnew mining industry regulations recently came into effect in Ghana, Africa, which require that the supply of specific products and services, and certain roles, be reserved for citizens, which may limit the pool of available contractors and service providers and restrict our ability to utilize certain contractors. Additionally, the Mexican government enacted labor and tax laws in April 2021, significantly restricting certain subcontracting and outsourcing of personnel, which has required the conversion of certain contractors to employee status and resulted in increased labor costs. Further changes in law and the occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. \n\nLegal Risks \n\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other extraterritorial and domestic anti-bribery laws and regulations, a breach or violation of which could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm. \n\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws and heightened expectations of enforcement authorities may be in tension with certain local customs and practices. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with extraterritorial reach, including the U.K. Bribery Act, and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. We have a business integrity and compliance program which includes our Code of Conduct, Business Integrity Policy and other policies and standards, all of which mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws by the Company and its affiliates and their personnel, and also by third parties when they are engaged on our behalf. Our program also includes a well-publicized helpline for raising complaints, questions and concerns as well as processes for evaluating and investigating such concerns and assurances of non-retaliation for persons who raise concerns in good faith. We report regularly to the executive leadership team and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on such programs and the results of investigations conducted. \n\nWe could be held responsible if our internal control policies and procedures fail to protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, regulations and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the our affiliates, employees, agents or associated persons for which we might be claimed to be responsible. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. In addition, the compliance mechanisms and monitoring programs adopted and implemented by Goldcorp prior to our acquisition of Goldcorp in April 2019 may not have adequately prevented or detected possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act (Canada) attributable to Goldcorp prior to our acquisition of Goldcorp and we may be held liable for any such violations. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in improper or unlawful conduct for which we might be held responsible. Our policy when receiving credible information or allegations is to conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to evaluate that information, determine compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations and company policies and take such remedial steps as may be warranted. In appropriate circumstances, we communicate with authorities in the United States and elsewhere about those investigations and reviews. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits and other collateral consequences, and may damage the Company&#8217;s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline. \n\nTitle to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or challenged. \n\nThe sufficiency or validity of the Company's rights, titles, or interests in and to its properties (\"Legal Title\") may be uncertain or challenged by third parties, including governmental authorities, Indigenous or communal peoples, or private parties. For example, at our Conga project in Peru, we continue to seek resolution to a land dispute with local residents. In Mexico, exploration and mining rights are granted through a mining concession, pertaining to the mineral estate, and do not include rights of ownership, possession, or access in or to the corresponding surface estate. Such rights in and to the surface estate are acquired through purchase, lease, or easement from private parties, local communities, or governmental authorities. We enter into temporary occupation agreements ranging from five to 30 years with the Ejido communities, which allow us to use the surface of the lands for our mining operations, and at any particular time we may be involved in negotiations to enter into new temporary occupation agreements or other surface access agreements or amend existing agreements. Failure to reach new agreements or disputes regarding existing agreements may cause, blockades, suspension of operations, delays to projects, and on occasion, may lead to legal disputes. \n\nIn addition, certain Australian and Canadian properties are owned by Indigenous peoples or are subject to certain inherent aboriginal rights, treaty rights, and/or asserted rights in and to their traditional territories, and our ability to acquire necessary rights to explore, develop, or mine these properties is dependent on agreements with them. Our ability to secure such agreements may be dependent on formal determinations of Indigenous or Native title rights issued by governmental authorities, the lack or delay of which may impede the Company&#8217;s ability to explore, develop, or mine. In French Guiana, Ghana and Suriname, our Legal Title may be subject to challenge based on the presence and activities of artisanal miners. See the risk factor under the heading &#8220; Illegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks &#8221; below for further information. A determination of insufficient or defective Legal Title or risks in connection with a challenge to our Legal Title could result in loss of Legal \n\nTitle, litigation, insurance claims, the impairment, preclusion, or cessation of exploration, development, or mining operations, and potential losses affecting the Company's business as a whole. \n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock \n\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. \n\nAs a publicly traded company listed on the NYSE and TSX, the market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: (i) changes in gold, and to a lesser extent, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices; (ii) operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors or our financial outlook; (iii) developments in our business or in the mining sector generally; (iv) regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; (v) the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; (vi) announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; (vii) our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; (viii) the perception of the Company&#8217;s ESG performance and its ability to deliver on ESG commitments and expectations, including in connection with the Company's climate strategy; (ix) response to activism; and (x) changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. \n\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends. \n\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock. An annualized dividend payout level has not been declared by the Board of Directors, and the declaration and payment of future dividends, including future quarterly dividends, remains at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Our dividend framework is non-binding, and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend framework or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. \n\n"

(100% owned) Pe&#241;asquito is an open pit operation located in the northeast corner of Zacatecas State, Mexico, approximately 125 miles (200 kilometers) northeast of the city of Zacatecas and is accessible by paved roads with a private airport close to the site. The property began production in 2009, with commercial production being achieved in 2010. Goldcorp acquired its ownership in the mine in 2006 when it acquired Glamis. In 2019, Newmont acquired Goldcorp, obtaining full ownership interest in Pe&#241;asquito. Pe&#241;asquito consists of the Pe&#241;asco and Chile Colorado open pit mines. \n\nPe&#241;asquito is comprised of 20 mining concessions for operations comprising 113,231 acres (45,823 hectares) and 60 mining concessions for exploration of 107,456 acres (43,486 hectares). Surface rights in the vicinity of the Pe&#241;asco and Chile Colorado open pits are held by three ejidos: Ejido Cedros, Ejido Mazapil and Ejido Cerro Gordo. Pe&#241;asquito has signed land use agreements with each ejidos, valid through 2035 and 2036, and the relevant private owners. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn August 2020, the Company and Cedros General Assembly ratified the definitive agreement that was reached on April 22, 2020 and resolved all outstanding disputes between Pe&#241;asquito and the San Juan de Cedros community (Cedros). In addition, easements have been granted in association with the La Pardita-Cedros Highway and the El Salero-Pe&#241;asquito powerline. All necessary permits have been granted. \n\nIn July 2007, Goldcorp and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (then Silver Wheaton Corp.) entered into a silver streaming agreement. The Company is obligated to sell 25% of silver production from the Pe&#241;asquito mine to Wheaton Precious Metals Corporation at the lesser of market price or a fixed contract price, subject to an annual inflation adjustment of up to 1.65%. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. \n\nA 2% net smelter return royalty is owed to Royal Gold Inc. from both the Chile Colorado and Pe&#241;asco open pits of the Pe&#241;asquito mine. Since January 1, 2014, the Mexican Government levies a 7.5% mining royalty that is imposed on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. There is also a 0.5% environmental erosion fee payable on precious metal production, based on revenues. In December 2016, the State of Zacatecas in Mexico approved new environmental taxes (&#8220;Ecological Taxes&#8221;) that became effective January 1, 2017. The Ecological Taxes are calculated based on a predetermined formula and the volume of carbon emissions, as well as other environmental variables, at Pe&#241;asquito. The Company's payment of the Ecological Taxes primarily relates to the volume of carbon emissions at Pe&#241;asquito from fixed and mobile sources. \n\nThe mineralization at Pe&#241;asquito contains gold, silver, lead and zinc. Deposits currently mined within the Pe&#241;asquito operations are considered to be examples of breccia pipes developed as a result of intrusion-related hydrothermal activity. \n\nProcess facilities include a sulfide processing plant, comprising four stages of flotation: carbon, lead, zinc and pyrite. The carbon pre-flotation circuit was added in 2018 ahead of lead flotation to remove organic carbon associated with sedimentary ores. In the lead and zinc flotation, the slurry is conditioned with reagents to activate the desired minerals and produce lead and zinc concentrates. The pyrite circuit flotation was added at the end of 2018, which treats the zinc tailings in a pyrite flotation leach, and Merrill Crowe process to recover additional silver and gold in the form of dor&#233;. The tailings from the leach circuit undergoes cyanide destruction and combines with final flotation tailings for final deposition in the tailings storage facility. \n\nThe available mining fleet consists of five rope shovels, three hydraulic shovels, three loaders, and 82 haul trucks, each with a 312-tonne payload. The fleet is supported by 9 blast hole production drills, as well as track dozers, rubber tire dozers, excavators, and graders. \n\nBrownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing. \n\nIn January 2011, Pe&#241;asquito entered into a 20-year power delivery agreement with a subsidiary of InterGen Servicios Mexico (now Saavi Energia) where Pe&#241;asquito agreed to purchase electrical power from a gas-fired electricity generating facility located near San Luis de la Paz, Guanajuato, Mexico. The agreement commenced in August 2015. Power is also supplied by the Mexican Electricity Federal Commission (Comision Federal de Electricidad) at its central power grid through the El Salero-Pe&#241;asquito powerline. \n\nPe&#241;asquito&#8217;s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was $6,003. \n\nPe&#241;asquito produced 566,000 ounces of gold and 1,048,000 gold equivalent ounces of other metals in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Pe&#241;asquito reported 5.4 million and 6.3 million ounces of gold reserves, respectively, 346 million ounces and 394 million of silver reserves, respectively, 2,300 million and 2,580 million pounds of lead, respectively, and 5,540 million and 6,250 million pounds of zinc, respectively. The overall reduction in gold reserves is primarily due to depletion. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Pe&#241;asquito reported 3.7 million and 2.9 million ounces of gold resources, respectively, 314 million ounces and 256 million of silver resources, respectively, 2,070 million and 1,710 million pounds of lead resources, respectively, and 4,740 million and 3,760 million pounds of zinc resources, respectively. The overall increase in gold resources is primarily due to net positive revisions. \n\nSouth America \n\nThe South America region maintains its headquarters in Miami, Florida and operates three sites, Yanacocha, Merian and Cerro Negro. We also hold a 40% interest in the Pueblo Viejo Mine, an open pit gold mine located in the Dominican Republic. Barrick operates the Pueblo Viejo Mine and holds the remaining 60% interest. \n\nYanacocha, Peru. (100% owned) In 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Compa&#241;ia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A.'s (&#8220;Buenaventura&#8221;) 43.65% noncontrolling interest and Summit Global Management II VB's, a subsidiary of Sumitomo (\"Sumitomo\"), 5% noncontrolling interest in Yanacocha. At December 31, 2022, the Company holds 100% ownership interest in Yanacocha.

(40% owned) Pueblo Viejo is a joint venture with Barrick, where Barrick is the operator. Commercial production was achieved in January 2013 and the Pueblo Viejo Mine completed its ramp-up to full design capacity in 2014. In March 2006, Barrick acquired the Pueblo Viejo mine as a result of their acquisition of Placer Dome Inc and subsequently sold 40% to Goldcorp. Newmont obtained the 40% ownership of Pueblo Viejo when Newmont acquired Goldcorp in 2019. We report our interest in Pueblo Viejo on an equity method basis. \n\nThe Pueblo Viejo mine is an open pit conventional truck and shovel mining operation located approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The Pueblo Viejo mine is situated on the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve, an area specially designated by Presidential Decree for the leasing of minerals and mine development, which covers an area of approximately 19,756 acres (7,995 hectares) in aggregate. The property is accessible year-round by paved road from Santo Domingo. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nA special lease agreement (&#8220;SLA&#8221;) between the Dominican State and Pueblo Viejo governs the development and operation of the Pueblo Viejo mine. The SLA provides the right to operate the Pueblo Viejo mine for a 25-year period commencing on February 26, 2008, with one extension by right for 25 years and a second 25-year extension by mutual agreement of the parties, allowing a possible total term of 75 years. Pueblo Viejo pays the Dominican Republic government a net smelter return royalty of 3.2% based on gross revenues for gold and silver, a net profits interest of 28.75% based on an adjusted taxable cash flow, a corporate income tax of 25% based on adjusted net income, a withholding tax on interest paid on loans and on payments abroad, and other general tax obligations which include a graduated minimum tax. \n\nThe Pueblo Viejo deposits are located in two major areas, the Monte Negro pit and the Moore pit, and consists of high sulfidation or acid sulfate epithermal gold, silver, copper and zinc mineralization. Process facilities include a conventional mill which consists of a crushing and grinding circuit, autoclaves, and a carbon-in-leach circuit. Pueblo Viejo is continuing to advance a plant expansion and tailings storage facility designed to extend its life to 2040 and beyond. In 2013, Pueblo Viejo commissioned a combined cycle reciprocating engine power plant, together with a transmission line connecting the plant to the mine site. The power plant is located near the port city of San Pedro de Macoris and will provide the long-term power supply for the Pueblo Viejo mine. In 2019, Pueblo Viejo signed a 10-year natural gas supply contract with AES Andres DR, S.A. (&#8220;AES&#8221;) in the Dominican Republic who also completed a new gas pipeline to the facility. \n\nThe available mining fleet consists of three shovels, five front loaders, 46 haul trucks, and seven drills. \n\nThe Company's attributable portion of Pueblo Viejo&#8217;s gross property, plant and mine development is $1,687 at December 31, 2022. We report our 40% interest in Pueblo Viejo on an equity method basis under U.S. GAAP and as a result our attributable portion of Pueblo Viejo's gross property, plant and mine development is included in the carrying value of our equity method investment at December 31, 2022. \n\nPueblo Viejo produced 285,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's attributable portion of gold reserve reported by Pueblo Viejo is 8.2 million and 3.6 million ounces of attributable gold reserves, respectively. The increase in reserves is primarily due the completion of the pre-feasibility study for the Tailings Storage Facility which resulted in the conversion of resources to reserves. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Pueblo Viejo reported 2.1 million and 7.3 million attributable ounces of gold resources, respectively. The decrease to resources is primarily due to the conversion of resources to reserves. \n\nAustralia \n\nThe Australia region maintains its headquarters in Perth, Australia and operates two sites, Boddington and Tanami. \n\nAboriginal land rights in Australia, which recognize the traditional rights and customs of Aboriginal people, are governed by the Commonwealth Native Title Act and certain other Acts specific to individual states and territories. The Commonwealth Native Title Act was enacted in 1993 following a decision in the High Court of Australia, which held that Aboriginal people, who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditional laws and customs, may hold certain rights which should be recognized under Australian common law. In the Northern Territory, where the Tanami operation is located, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act (&#8220;ALRA&#8221;) was introduced in 1976, which established an Aboriginal Land rights regime. Under the ALRA, approximately 50% of the land in the Northern Territory is Aboriginal freehold land. \n\nAll of Newmont&#8217;s operations in Australia take place on land that falls under the custodianship of Aboriginal people. Newmont does not consider that native title claims or determined areas where rights have been established are an impediment to the operation of existing mines. Newmont has existing agreements with the traditional owners of the land utilized by our Tanami and Boddington operations. Any future agreements would depend on a determination of native title, which is likely to take many years. If successful, a native title determination could give rights to compensation claims in the future. Throughout Australia, new exploratory and mining tenements may require native title agreements to be entered into and will be subject to a negotiation process, which often gives rise to compensation payments and heritage survey protocols. \n\nIn Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Aboriginal groups have negotiated compensation/royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where native title rights are determined or where they own the land. \n\n##TABLE_START Boddington, Australia. (100% owned) Boddington is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia and is accessible primarily by paved road. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited. \n\nThe Boddington project area comprises 52,506 acres (21,249 hectares) of mining tenure leased from the State of Western Australia, of which 26,910 acres (10,890 hectares) is subleased from the South 32 Worsley Joint Venturers (\"Worsley JV\"). The total project area is comprised of multiple leases that expire between 2023 and 2041. Royalties are paid to the state government at 2.5% for gold and 5% for copper based on revenue. Shipping and treatment and refining costs are allowable deductions from revenue for royalty calculations for copper. Newmont owns 74,474 acres (30,139 hectares) of rural freehold property, some of which overlaps existing mining tenure. The majority of its current operational area is located on its freehold property. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe subleases from the Worsley JV expire immediately prior to the expiry of the relevant mining leases. Newmont holds rights to renew the subleases. The mining leases are renewable upon application to the State of Western Australia by the Worsley JV. As these mining leases are in their third term, renewal of these mining leases is at the discretion of the State. The subleases do not confer an express right to require the Worsley JV to seek application to renew the mining leases. Newmont is entitled to all gold and other non-bauxite mineralization conferred by the mining leases. The Worsley JV retains the rights to bauxite mineralization. The relationship between the Worsley JV bauxite operations and the Boddington gold operations are regulated through a cross-operation agreement. This agreement confers priority on the bauxite operations such that the bauxite/alumina mining operations of the Worsley JV will take priority over the gold mining operations and Newmont is required to take reasonable measures to conserve bauxite including by mining and stockpiling bauxite on behalf of the Worsley JV. \n\nBoddington consists of greenstone diorite hosted mineralization and exploration activities continue to develop the known reserve. The mine operates two pits (North and South Pits), utilizing two electric rope shovels, a diesel powered face shovel and an electric hydraulic shovel as its prime ex-pit material movers with a fleet of 36 production autonomous haulage trucks. Boddington has a current capacity to mine approximately 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of material per day. The milling plant includes a three-stage crushing facility (two primary crushers, six secondary crushers and four high-pressure grinding rolls), four ball mills, a flotation circuit and a carbon-in-leach circuit. The flotation circuit process recovers gold-copper concentrate before the material is then processed by a traditional carbon-in-leach circuit where the remaining gold is recovered to produce dor&#233;. Mining operations consist of two open pit operations located adjacent to each other. \n\nPower for the operation is sourced through the local power grid under a long-term power purchase agreement with Bluewaters Power. The power supply contract with Bluewaters commenced in 2006 with a term of 17 years and includes an option to extend. \n\nBoddington&#8217;s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was $4,612. \n\nBoddington produced 798,000 ounces of gold and 227,000 gold equivalent ounces of other metals in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Boddington reported 10.6 million and 11.6 million ounces of gold reserves, respectively, and 1,160 million and 1,290 million pounds of copper reserves. respectively. The overall reduction in gold reserves is primarily due to depletion. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Boddington reported 4.6 million and 4.8 million ounces of gold resources, respectively, and 660 million and 680 million pounds of copper resources, respectively. The gold resources remained consistent. \n\nBrownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing. \n\nTanami, Australia. (100% owned) Tanami is located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs. The underground mining infrastructure and operation is located at Dead Bullock Soak (&#8220;DBS&#8221;). The processing infrastructure is located 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the east of the mining operations at the Granites. Ore is transported by road train from DBS underground to the processing facility at the Granites. \n\nThe Newmont Tanami Operations are comprised of exploration licenses encompassing a total area of 1,620,332 acres (655,725 hectares) including 677,736 acres (274,270 hectares) relating to the Tobruk and Monza Joint Ventures entered into with Prodigy Gold, for which Newmont is the operator, and 11,025 acres (4,462 hectares) of mineral leases granted pursuant to the Northern Territory Mineral Titles Act. Additionally, Newmont operates through agreements with the Central Land Council who represent the Warlpiri people. \n\nTanami consists of sediment hosted sheeted quartz vein mineralization. Tanami, as an underground mining operation, has a fleet of ten underground loaders and 22 haul trucks, each with 60 to 65-tonne payloads. Processing plant facilities currently consist of a crushing plant, a grinding circuit, gravity carbon in pulp tanks and a conventional tailings disposal facility. Tanami&#8217;s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was $2,608. Tanami produced 484,000 ounces of gold in 2022 and reported 5.7 million ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2022. \n\nBrownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing with the main focus being underground ore definition drilling of the Auron, Federation and Liberator ore bodies as well as exploration of the Oberon deposit. \n\nAfrica \n\nThe Africa region maintains its headquarters in Accra, Ghana and operates two sites, Ahafo and Akyem. \n\nIn December 2003, Ghana&#8217;s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement (&#8220;IA&#8221;) between Newmont and the government of Ghana. The IA established a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. In December 2015, Ghana&#8217;s Parliament ratified the Revised Investment Agreements (&#8220;Ghana Investment Agreements&#8221; or &#8220;Revised IAs&#8221;). Currently, the maximum corporate income tax rate remains at 32.5% and royalties are paid on a sliding scale system that is based on average monthly gold prices. The rates range from 3% to 5% of revenues (plus an additional 0.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project&#8217;s net cash flow after reaching specific production milestones by receiving 1/9th of the total amount paid as dividends to Newmont parent. When the average quoted gold price exceeds $1,300 per ounce within a calendar year, an advance payment on these amounts of 0.6% of total revenues is required. The Ghana Investment Agreements also contain commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection. \n\nThe Ghana Investment Agreements also include a change in tax stabilization from life of mine to 15 years from commercial production for each mine. In October 2017, the government of Ghana approved Newmont&#8217;s request to extend the stability period of the Revised IAs at the Ahafo operations for five years to December 31, 2025. The extension was approved based on Newmont&#8217;s commitment to invest at least $300 for the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion projects. This commitment was completed during the fourth quarter of 2018. \n\nThe Ahafo and Akyem mines operate using electrical power generated by the Volta River Authority along with supplemental power generation capacity built by Newmont. \n\n##TABLE_START Ahafo, Ghana. (100% owned) Our current Ahafo operation (\"Ahafo South\") is located near Kenyasi in the Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of the national capital city of Accra, and is largely accessible by paved roads. In 2002, Newmont acquired 50% of Ahafo South as a result of the merger with Normandy. In 2003, Newmont purchased the remaining interest from Moydow Mines International Inc. (&#8220;Moydow&#8221;), thereby making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The Ahafo South mine commenced commercial production in 2006 and currently operates a mill, two pits and an underground operation. In July 2021, the Board of Directors approved full funding for the Ahafo North project which will expand our existing footprint in Ghana with four open pit mines and a stand-alone mill located approximately 30 kilometers from our current Ahafo South operations. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Ahafo South operations are comprised of three mining leases issued under the Ghanaian Mining Act encompassing a total area of approximately 137,000 acres (55,000 hectares) with current mine take area of approximately 13,200 acres (5,300 hectares) that has been fully compensated and approximately 10,700 acres (4,300 hectares) of mining area that has not been fully compensated (e.g. payment would be necessary to move people from their land). The mining leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area, including the processing, storing and transportation of mineral and materials. The mining leases require Ahafo South to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations and expire in 2031 and are renewable subject to certain conditions. Ahafo South pays a royalty of 2% on net smelter returns to Franco-Nevada for all gold ounces recovered from areas previously owned by Moydow and a sliding scale royalty based on the average monthly gold price up to 5% on gold production to the government of Ghana. \n\nThe Ahafo South mine is composed of three orogenic gold deposits that have oxide and primary mineralization. Gold occurs primarily in pyrite and secondarily as native gold in quartz veins. Ahafo South has two active open pits, Subika and Awonsu. Subika added an underground operation, which reached commercial production in November 2018, and Awonsu completed a layback in November 2019. The available mining fleet for surface mining consists of three shovels and 36 haul trucks, each with 141-tonne payload. The available mining fleet for underground mining consists of eight underground loaders and 12 haul trucks, with payload ranging from 50 to 55-tonnes. The daily production rate is approximately 95,000 tonnes. The original processing plant was commissioned in 2006. The Ahafo Mill Expansion, which was completed in October 2019, expanded the plant capacity to process approximately 11 million tonnes per year. The current processing plant consists of two crushing plants, two grinding circuits, carbon-in-leach circuits, elution circuit, counter current decantation circuit, a tailings disposal facility and an analytical laboratory managed by a third party. \n\nBrownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing. \n\nAhafo South&#8217;s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was $3,052. \n\nAhafo South produced 574,000 ounces of gold in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Ahafo South reported 5.7 million and 6.1 million ounces of gold reserves respectively. The overall reduction in gold reserves is primarily due to depletion. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Ahafo South reported 5.2 million and 5.0 million ounces of gold resources respectively. The overall increase in gold resources is primarily due to exploration additions and positive net revisions partially offset by conversion to reserves. \n\nAkyem, Ghana . (100% owned) Akyem, located in Birim North District of the Eastern Region of Ghana, approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of the national capital city of Accra, is an open pit mining operation comprised of two mining leases issued under the Ghanaian Mining Act, encompassing an area of approximately 16,000 acres (6,000 hectares). The Akyem mine is an orogenic gold deposit that has oxide and primary mineralization. Process facilities include a crushing plant, a SAG and ball milling circuit, carbon-in-leach circuit, elution circuit and bullion smelting facilities. The available mining fleet consists of four excavators made up of two front end shovels and two backhoe excavators and twenty one 136-tonne haul trucks. Akyem&#8217;s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was $1,697. Akyem produced 420,000 ounces of gold in 2022 and reported 1.5 million ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2022. \n\nNevada \n\n##TABLE_START NGM, Nevada, U.S. (38.5% owned) Nevada Gold Mines (\"NGM\") is located in Elko, Nevada. On July 1, 2019, Newmont and Barrick consummated the Nevada JV Agreement, which combined the Company&#8217;s Nevada mining operations with Barrick&#8217;s Nevada mining operations resulting in the establishment of NGM; a joint venture with Barrick who is the operator. NGM operations are primarily accessible by paved road and is comprised of 180,921 acres (73,217 hectares) in aggregate including Cortez 53,999 acres (21,853 hectares), Carlin 58,255 acres (23,575 hectares), Turquoise Ridge 26,679 acres (10,797 hectares), Phoenix 17,900 acres (7,244 hectares), and Long Canyon 24,088 acres (9,748 hectares). \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAll sites at NGM contain open pit operations while Cortez, Carlin, and Turquoise Ridge also include underground operations. At Cortez, mineralization is sedimentary rock-hosted and consists of submicron to micrometer-sized gold particles and gold in solid solution in pyrite. Refractory ore is transported to Carlin for processing. Phoenix is a skarn-hosted polymetallic massive sulfide replacement deposit. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. Carlin, Turquoise Ridge, and Long Canyon are a sediment-hosted disseminated gold deposit. Additionally, at Long Canyon, oxide ore with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on a heap leach pad. Gold recovered from the leach pad is transferred as gold-bearing carbon to Carlin for refining and shipment. \n\nIn Nevada, mining taxes are assessed on up to 5% of net proceeds of a mine. During 2021, the Nevada legislature enacted a new excise tax which is assessed up to 1.1% of gross revenues. \n\nNGM owns, or controls through leases, fee ownership, and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations. The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, NGM pays a net smelter royalty equivalent to 16.2% of the mineral production. NGM wholly-owns or controls the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, NGM is obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1% to 8% of production. \n\nEach site has its own process facilities which include: an oxide mill, which consists of a crushing and grinding circuit and carbon-in-leach circuit, and two heap leach pads at Cortez; an autoclave, two roasters, an oxide mill/flotation circuit and four heap leach pads at Carlin; the Sage autoclave, an oxide mill, and three heap leach pads at Turquoise Ridge; a flotation mill, a carbon-in-leach plant, a copper leach pad and a solvent extraction electrowinning (&#8220;SX/EW&#8221;) plant at Phoenix; and a heap leach pad at Long Canyon. NGM has a current capacity across all sites to mine approximately 340,000 tonnes of material per day. The milling facilities were commissioned over a range of years beginning in the 1990&#8217;s. They undergo routine maintenance each year with process improvements implemented as the projects are identified and approved. Power is either purchased in the open market or supplied by the power plants owned and operated by NGM. \n\nThe NGM operations include, in aggregate, an open pit mining fleet consisting of 28 shovels and 155 haul trucks with an average payload of 261 tonnes, and an underground mining fleet consisting of 51 underground loaders and 76 haul trucks, with an average payload of 30 tonnes. \n\nNewmont&#8217;s share of NGM&#8217;s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was $8,081. \n\nNGM produced 1,169,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's attributable portion of gold reserve reported by NGM is 18.6 million and 19.3 million attributable ounces of gold reserves, respectively. The decrease in reserves is primarily due to mining depletion, which offset net positive revisions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, NGM reported 19.2 million and 16.2 million attributable ounces of gold resources, respectively. The increase to resources is primarily due to exploration additions and positive net revisions. \n\nBrownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing. \n\nOperating Statistics \n\nOperating Statistics, Proven and Probable Reserves and Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources presented below contain tabular information that is presented in both metric and imperial as follows: (i) metric tonnage is utilized for all metals;

The risks that could affect title to our property are included above in Item 1A, Risk Factors. \n\nA &#8220;mineral reserve&#8221; is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. The term &#8220;economically viable,&#8221; as used in the definition of reserve, means that the qualified person has analytically determined that extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. \n\nThe term &#8220;proven reserves&#8221; means the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource. The term &#8220;probable reserves&#8221; means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less closely spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or molybdenum attributable to Newmont&#8217;s ownership or economic interest. \n\nProven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The reference point for mineral reserves is the point of delivery to the process plant. Metal price assumptions, adjusted for our exchange rate assumption, are based on considering such factors as market forecasts, industry consensus and management estimates. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralization considered economic to process, varies between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or molybdenum extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available. Reserve estimates may have non-material differences in comparison to our joint venture partners due to differences in classification and rounding methodology. \n\nThe proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum will be realized. Ounces of gold or silver or pounds of copper, lead, zinc or molybdenum included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing higher cost reserves uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves. \n\nWe had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 96.1 million ounces at December 31, 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company raised the reserves gold pricing assumption from $1,200 in 2021 to $1,400. The increase in reserves gold pricing assumption is based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of multiple factors, including historical gold pricing trends, consensus price forecasts, impacts of inflation and resulting high-interest rate environment, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These volatile market conditions have created a high degree of uncertainty in the global markets, which \n\nhave historically positively impacted gold prices. We estimate our 2022 reserves would increase by 3% (3.3 million ounces), or decline by 7% (7.2 million ounces), if estimated at a $1,500 and $1,300 per ounce gold price, respectively, with all other assumptions remaining constant. \n\nWe publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2023, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, to future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2023. \n\nThe Company has internal controls for reviewing and documenting the information supporting the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, describing the methods used, and ensuring the validity of the estimates. These internal control processes were not materially impacted by the adoption of S-K 1300 in 2021. Information that is utilized to compile mineral reserves and resources is prepared and certified by appropriately qualified persons at the mine site level and is subject to our internal review process which includes review by the Newmont-designated region and the Qualified Person (&#8220;QP&#8221;) based in our corporate office in Denver, Colorado. Additionally, all material sites are audited every other year and the non-material sites on a three-year cycle by subject matter experts for compliance to internal standards and guidelines as well as regulatory requirements. The QP presents the mineral reserve and mineral resource information to the Audit Committee and the Disclosure Committee on an annual basis for further review. \n\nThe following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves reflecting only those reserves attributable to Newmont&#8217;s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Gold Reserves at December 31, 2022 (1) \n\nProven Reserves Probable Reserves Proven and Probable Reserves Deposits/Districts Newmont Share Tonnage (2) \n\n(000 tonnes) \n\nGrade (g/tonne) Ounces (3) \n\n(000) \n\nTonnage (2) \n\n(000 tonnes) \n\nGrade (g/tonne) Ounces (3) \n\n(000) \n\nTonnage (2) \n\n(000 tonnes) \n\nGrade (g/tonne) Ounces (3) \n\n(000) \n\nMetallurgical \n\nRecovery (3) \n\nNorth America CC&#38;V Open Pits \n\n100% 49,300 0.39 620 12,000 0.31 120 61,400 0.37 740 57% CC&#38;V Leach Pads (4)(5) \n\n100% &#8212;

The risks that could affect title to our property are included above in Item 1A, Risk Factors. \n\nThe measured, indicated, and inferred resource figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation and are exclusive of reserves. A &#8220;mineral resource&#8221; is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth&#8217;s crust in such form, grade, or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. The reference point for mineral \n\nresources is in situ. Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories. Ounces of gold and silver or pounds of copper, zinc, lead, and molybdenum included in the measured, indicated and inferred resources are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. The terms \"measured resource,\" \"indicated resource,\" and \"inferred resource\" mean that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of geological evidence and sampling that is considered to be comprehensive, adequate, or limited, respectively. \n\nMarket fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and molybdenum, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could change future estimates of resources. Metal price assumptions are based on approximately a fifteen to twenty-five percent premium over reserve prices. \n\nOur exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new resources and converting it into proven and probable reserves. We conduct brownfield exploration around our existing mines and greenfield exploration in other regions globally. Brownfield exploration can result in the discovery of additional deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of existing operating, processing and administrative infrastructures. In contrast, the discovery of mineralization through greenfield exploration efforts will require capital investment to build a stand-alone operation. Our Exploration expense was $231, $209 and $187 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nWe had attributable measured and indicated gold resources of 75.3 million ounces and attributable inferred gold resources of 36.1 million ounces at December 31, 2022. For 2022 and 2021, attributable measured, indicated, and inferred gold resources were estimated at a gold price assumption of $1,600 and $1,400 per ounce, respectively. The increase in the resource gold pricing assumption in 2022 from 2021 is based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of multiple factors, including historical gold pricing trends, consensus price forecasts, impacts of inflation and resulting high-interest rate environment, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These volatile market conditions have created a high degree of uncertainty in the global markets, which have historically positively impacted gold prices. \n\nThe resource figures presented herein do not include that part of our resources that have been converted to Proven and Probable Reserves as shown above, as they are reported exclusive of reserves, and have been estimated based on information available at the time of calculation. \n\nThe Company has internal controls for reviewing and documenting the information supporting the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, describing the methods used, and ensuring the validity of the estimates. Refer to Proven and Probable Reserves above for further information on these internal controls. \n\nWe publish measured, indicated, and inferred resources annually, and will recalculate them at December 31, 2023, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and conversion to reserves, as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2023. \n\nThe following tables detail measured, indicated, and inferred resources reflecting only those that are attributable to Newmont&#8217;s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Gold Resources at December 31, 2022 (1)(2) \n\nMeasured Resources Indicated Resources Measured and Indicated Resources \n\nInferred Resources Deposits/Districts Newmont Share Tonnage \n\n(000 tonnes) \n\nGrade (g/tonne) Ounces \n\n(000) \n\nTonnage \n\n(000 tonnes) \n\nGrade (g/tonne) Ounces \n\n(000) \n\nTonnage \n\n(000 tonnes) \n\nGrade (g/tonne) Ounces \n\n(000) \n\nTonnage \n\n(000 tonnes) \n\nGrade (g/tonne) Ounces \n\n(000) \n\nMetallurgical \n\nRecovery (3) \n\nNorth America CC&#38;V, Colorado \n\n100% 79,700 0.38 980 42,300 0.32 440 122,000 0.36 1,420 32,200 0.34 350 59% Musselwhite, Canada 100% 1,300 3.92 170 2,600 3.93 330 3,900 3.93 490 3,000 4.15 410 95% Porcupine Underground 100% 300 6.69 70 1,000 8.64 270 1,300 8.15 340 1,800 8.08 480 92% Porcupine Open Pit 100% 200 0.51 &#8212;

      "text": " ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES \n\nAt Newmont, safety is a core value, and we strive for superior performance. Our health and safety management system, which includes detailed standards and procedures for safe production, addresses topics such as employee training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. In addition to strong leadership and involvement from all levels of the organization, these programs and procedures form the cornerstone of safety at Newmont, ensuring that employees are provided a safe and healthy environment and are intended to reduce workplace accidents, incidents and losses, comply with all mining-related regulations and provide support for both regulators and the industry to improve mine safety. \n\nIn addition, we have established our &#8220;Rapid Response&#8221; crisis management process to mitigate and prevent the escalation of adverse consequences if existing risk management controls fail, particularly if an incident may have the potential to seriously impact the safety of employees, the community or the environment. This process provides appropriate support to an affected site to complement their technical response to an incident, so as to reduce the impact by considering the environmental, strategic, legal, financial and public image aspects of the incident, to ensure communications are being carried out in accordance with legal and ethical requirements and to identify actions in addition to those addressing the immediate hazards. \n\nThe health and safety of our people and our host communities is paramount. This is why Newmont engaged its Rapid Response process early in connection with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and continues to sustain robust controls at our operations and offices globally. For steps taken by the Company, refer to \"COVID-19 Pandemic\" in Item 1, Business. \n\nThe operation of our U.S. based mine is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;MSHA&#8221;) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the &#8220;Mine Act&#8221;). MSHA inspects our mine on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years. \n\nNewmont is required to report certain mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, and that required information is included in Exhibit 95 and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. It is noted that the Nevada mines owned by NGM, in which the Company holds a 38.5% interest, are not included in the Company&#8217;s Exhibit 95 mine safety disclosure reporting as such sites are operated by our joint venture partner, Barrick. \n\nPART II \n\n"

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nThe following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Newmont,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221;). We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in our MD&#38;A. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this MD&#38;A, please refer to the discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measures. This item should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. \n\nThe following MD&#38;A generally discusses our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are included in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2022. \n\nOverview \n\nNewmont is the world&#8217;s leading gold company and is the only gold company included in the S&#38;P 500 Index and the Fortune 500 list of companies. We have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World since 2007 and have adopted the World Gold Council&#8217;s Conflict-Free Gold Policy. Since 2015, Newmont has been ranked as the mining and metal sector&#8217;s top gold miner by the S&#38;P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Newmont has been ranked the top miner in 3BL Media&#8217;s 100 Best Corporate Citizens list which ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded U.S. companies on ESG transparency and performance since 2020. We are primarily engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties, some of which may contain copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals. We have significant operations and/or assets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. Our goal is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. \n\nRefer to the Consolidated Financial Results, Results of Consolidated Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Non-GAAP Financial Measures for information about the continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting significant inflation experienced globally, as well as the effects of certain counter measures taken by central banks, on the Company. Also refer to discussion of Risk and Uncertainties within Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, relating to inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, with particular consideration on the outlook for increased costs specific to labor, materials, consumables and fuel and energy on operations, as well as impacts on the timing and cost of capital expenditures and the risk of potential impairment to certain assets. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, as a result of these challenging market conditions, record inflation rates, the rising prices for commodities and raw materials, prolonged supply chain disruptions, competitive labor markets and consideration of capital allocation, the Company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. With the delay of the Yanacocha Sulfides project, management will focus its efforts on optimizing its allocation of funds to current operations and other capital commitments, while also assessing execution options and project plans options, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion \n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Buenaventura's 43.65% noncontrolling interest in Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (\"Yanacocha\") (the \"Yanacocha Transaction\") and sold its 46.94% ownership interest in Minera La Zanja S.R.L. (\"La Zanja\"). The Company acquired the remaining 5% interest previously held by Sumitomo in the second quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company holds 100% ownership interest in Yanacocha. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding these transactions. \n\nFor information on asset sales impacting comparability of below results, refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nConsolidated Financial Results \n\nThe details of our Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders are set forth below: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2022 2021 Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders $ (459) $ 1,109 $ (1,568) Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders per common share, diluted $ (0.58) $ 1.39 $ (1.97) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2021 2020 Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 1,109 $ 2,666 $ (1,557) Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders per common share, diluted $ 1.39 $ 3.31 $ (1.92) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to higher Impairment charges resulting from impairment of goodwill at Cerro Negro and Porcupine and impairment of long-lived assets at CC&#38;V, higher Costs applicable to sales predominately resulting from cost inflation impacts and $70 related to the profit-sharing agreement entered into by the Company in 2022 at Pe&#241;asquito (the \"Pe&#241;asquito Profit-Sharing Agreement\") related to 2021 site performance, and lower sales volumes for all metals except copper, partially offset by lower Reclamation and remediation, lower income tax expense, and the Loss on assets held for sale in 2021 related to the Conga mill assets. For additional information, refer to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe details and analyses of our Sales for all periods presented are set forth below.

Exploration expense increased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in drilling projects in the current year, particularly at South America, NGM and Africa, as a result of projects being delayed from prior years due to COVID-19 and higher drilling costs due to cost inflation. \n\nAdvanced projects, research and development expense was $229, $154 and $122 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Advanced projects, research and development expense increased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to payments made as part of the strategic alliance with Caterpillar Inc. (\"CAT\") relating to the Company's climate change initiatives and project spend relating to certain development projects at Cerro Negro in South America and Galore Creek in Corporate and Other. Advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and other project expenses that do not qualify for capitalization. \n\nGeneral and administrative expense was $276, $259 and $269 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. General and administrative expense increased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to increased labor costs. General and administrative expense as a percentage of Sales was 2.3%, 2.1% and 2.3% for 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. \n\nInterest expense, net was $227, $274 and $308 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $69, $38, and $24 in each year, respectively. Interest expense, net decreased in 2022, compared to 2021, as a result of the repayment of debt in 2021 and 2022 and higher capitalization of interest. \n\nIncome and mining tax expense (benefit) was $455, $1,098, and $704 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors and the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods will be primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) impacts of the changes in tax law; (iv) valuation allowances on tax assets; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and foreign currencies; and (vii) the impact of specific transactions and assessments including a significant impairment of goodwill during 2022. As a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. This trend is expected to continue in future periods.

All-In Sustaining Costs per gold ounce increased 33% primarily due to higher costs applicable to sales per gold ounce and higher sustaining capital spend. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates \n\nOur foreign operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc production based on USD metal prices. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do not have a material impact on our revenue. Despite selling gold and silver in London, we have no exposure to the euro or the British pound. \n\nForeign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profits to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies, including the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the Argentine peso, the Peruvian sol, the Surinamese dollar and the Ghanaian cedi. In 2022, approximately 49% of Costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 Australian Dollar 16 % Mexican Peso 13 % Canadian Dollar 12 % Argentine Peso 4 % Peruvian Sol 3 % Surinamese Dollar 1 % Ghanaian Cedi &#8212; % ##TABLE_END\n\nVariations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased Costs applicable to sales by $34 per ounce in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily in Argentina, Australia, and Canada. \n\nOur Cerro Negro mine, located in Argentina, is a USD functional currency entity. Argentina has a hyperinflationary economy with a cumulative inflation rate of over 216% for the last three years. In recent years, Argentina&#8217;s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, including requiring the Company to convert USD proceeds from metal sales to local currency within 60 days from shipment date or five business days from receipt of cash, whichever happens first, as well as restricting payments to foreign-related entities denominated in foreign currency, such as dividends or distributions to the parent and related companies and royalties and other payments to foreign beneficiaries. These restrictions directly impact Cerro Negro's ability to pay principal portions of intercompany debt to the Company. We continue to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk and the limitations of repatriating cash to the U.S. Currently, these currency controls are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nOur Merian mine, located in the country of Suriname, is a USD functional currency entity. Suriname has experienced significant inflation over the last three years and has a highly inflationary economy. In 2021, the Central Bank took steps to stabilize the local currency, while the government introduced new legislation to narrow the gap between government revenues and spending. The measures to increase government revenue mainly consist of tax increases; however, Newmont and the Republic of Suriname have a Mineral Agreement in place that supersedes such measures. The Central Bank of Suriname adopted a controlled floating rate system, which resulted in a concurrent devaluation of the Surinamese dollar. The majority of Merian&#8217;s activity has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, the devaluation of the Surinamese dollar has resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Therefore, future devaluation of the Surinamese dollar is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nLiquidity Overview \n\nWe have a disciplined cash allocation strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. \n\nThe continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting significant inflation experienced globally, as well as the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, have been and are expected to continue to adversely affect the Company. Depending on the duration and extent of the impact of these events, commodity prices and the prices for gold and other metals could continue to experience volatility; transportation industry disruptions could continue, including limitations on shipping produced metals; our supply chain could continue to experience disruption; cost inflation rates could further increase; or we could incur credit related losses of certain financial assets, which could materially impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As of December 31, 2022, we believe our available liquidity allows us to manage the short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts of these events on our business. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on risks and uncertainties. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had $2,877 in Cash and cash equivalents. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company began investing in time deposits with a maturity of more than three months but less than one year, and at December 31, 2022 the Company had $829 of these time deposits, which are included in Time deposits and other investments . Our Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits are highly liquid and low-risk investments that are able to fund our operations as necessary. We may have investments in prime money market funds that are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the SEC requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could \n\nhave a net asset value less than their par value. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, $907 of Cash and cash equivalents was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to USD. Cash and cash equivalents denominated in Argentine Peso are subject to regulatory restrictions. Refer to Foreign Currency Exchange Rates above for further information. At December 31, 2022, $658 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. We expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with any potential withholding taxes. \n\nWe believe our existing consolidated Cash and cash equivalents , time deposits, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2022, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $3,000, and we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We continue to remain compliant with covenants and do not currently anticipate any events or circumstances that would impact our ability to access funds available on this facility. Refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our Debt . \n\nOur financial position was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,877 $ 4,992 \n\nTime deposits (1) \n\n829 &#8212; Borrowing capacity on revolving credit facility 3,000 3,000 Total liquidity $ 6,706 $ 7,992 \n\nNet debt (2) \n\n$ 2,426 $ 1,310 ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Time deposits are included within Time deposits and other investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. \n\nCash Flows \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations was $3,198 in 2022, a decrease in cash provided of $1,068 from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in operating cash expenditures resulting from the impacts of cost inflation due to higher input commodity prices, notably fuel and energy costs, and increased labor costs; lower sales volumes, and payments related to: (i) increased reclamation and remediation obligations, (ii) the Pe&#241;asquito Profit-Sharing Agreement, (iii) previously accrued employee severance resulting from a recent employment model change in Ghana, and (iv) our strategic alliance with CAT. \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations was $(2,983) in 2022, an increase in cash used of $1,115 from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the purchase of time deposits and higher capital expenditures in 2022, partially offset by the acquisition of GT Gold in 2021. \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(2,356) in 2022, a decrease in cash used of $602 from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher stock repurchases in 2021 and higher net repayments of debt in 2021, partially offset by the acquisition of non-controlling interest in Yanacocha in 2022. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nIn February 2023, the Board declared a dividend of $0.40 per share, determined under the dividend framework. This framework is non-binding and is periodically reviewed and reassessed by the Board of Directors. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the full discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company&#8217;s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. \n\nThe Company's stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion of common stock expired on December 31, 2022. We repurchased $525 under the plan, all of which was completed in 2021. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nCash generated from operations is used to execute our capital priorities, which include sustaining and developing our global portfolio of long-lived assets. Our near-term development capital projects include Tanami Expansion 2 and Ahafo North, which are being funded from existing liquidity and will continue to be funded from future operating cash flows. Capital costs are estimated to be \n\nbetween $1,200 and $1,300 for Tanami Expansion 2 and between $950 and $1,050 for Ahafo North, with the first full year of commercial production expected to be 2026 for both projects. \n\nWe consider sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations, where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are considered non-sustaining or development capital. The Company&#8217;s decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project, which may include returning mining concessions to host governments, could result in a future impairment charge. \n\nThe Company continues to evaluate strategic priorities and deployment of capital to projects in the pipeline to ensure we execute on our capital priorities and provide long-term value to shareholders. Included in the Company's continuous evaluation is consideration of current market opportunities or pressures. In response to the current challenging market conditions, which include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, in the third quarter of 2022 the Company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. \n\nIn 2020, we announced climate targets to reduce GHG emissions and plans to invest in climate change initiatives in support of this goal, which may be capital in nature. As part of these initiatives, in November 2021, Newmont announced a strategic alliance with CAT with the aim to develop and implement a comprehensive all-electric autonomous mining system to achieve zero emissions mining. To support this alliance, Newmont pledged a preliminary investment of $100, of which $39 has been paid as of December 31, 2022 and is recognized in Advanced projects, research and development within our Consolidated Statements of Operations, to CAT in connection with automation and electrification goals for surface and underground mining infrastructures and haulage fleets. The remaining pledged amount is anticipated to be paid as certain milestones are reached through 2025. \n\nOther investments supporting our climate change initiatives are expected to include emissions reduction projects and renewable energy opportunities as we seek to achieve these climate targets. For risks related to climate-related capital expenditures, refer to Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 we had Additions to property, plant and mine development as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Development Projects Sustaining Capital Total Development Projects Sustaining Capital Total Development Projects Sustaining Capital Total North America $ 128 $ 369 $ 497 $ 30 $ 309 $ 339 $ 49 $ 269 $ 318 South America 497 133 630 201 127 328 93 111 204 Australia 236 189 425 257 228 485 132 248 380 Africa 185 121 306 154 125 279 44 103 147 Nevada 78 230 308 63 171 234 81 160 241 Corporate and other 7 17 24 3 25 28 7 42 49 Accrual basis $ 1,131 $ 1,059 $ 2,190 $ 708 $ 985 $ 1,693 $ 406 $ 933 $ 1,339 Decrease (increase) in non-cash adjustments \n\n(59) (40) (37) Cash basis $ 2,131 $ 1,653 $ 1,302 ##TABLE_END\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, development projects included Pamour in North America; Yanacocha Sulfides and Cerro Negro expansion projects in South America; Tanami Expansion 2 and Power Generation Civil Upgrade in Australia; Ahafo North and Subika Mining Method Change in Africa; and Goldrush Complex and the Turquoise Ridge 3rd Shaft in Nevada. \n\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into A$574 of AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts to mitigate variability in the USD functional cash flows related to the AUD-denominated capital expenditures expected to be incurred in 2023 and 2024 during the construction and development phase of the Tanami Expansion 2 project.

The Company from time to time will redeem its outstanding senior notes ahead of their scheduled maturity dates utilizing Cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, depending upon market conditions and strategic considerations, we may choose to refinance debt in the capital markets. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, our future debt maturities include $5,624 that mature beginning in 2029. We generally expect to be able to fund maturities of debt from Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities , Time deposits and other investments , existing cash balances and available credit facilities. \n\nRefer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on redemptions and future debt maturities. \n\nDebt Covenants \n\nOur senior notes and revolving credit facility contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, leases, sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions.

Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nSupplemental Guarantor Information \n\nThe Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, of 1933, as amended, which enables us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants and units (the &#8220;Shelf Registration Statement&#8221;). Under the Shelf Registration Statement, our debt securities may be guaranteed by Newmont USA Limited (&#8220;Newmont USA&#8221;), one of our consolidated subsidiaries (Newmont, as issuer, and Newmont USA, as guarantor, are collectively referred to here-within as the \"Obligor Group\"). These guarantees are full and unconditional, and none of our other subsidiaries guarantee any security issued and outstanding. The cash provided by operations of the Obligor Group, and all of its subsidiaries, is available to satisfy debt repayments as they become due, and there are no material restrictions on the ability of the Obligor Group to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend, loan, or otherwise, except to the extent of any rights noncontrolling interests, foreign currency or regulatory restrictions limiting repatriation of cash. Net assets attributable to noncontrolling interests were $179 at December 31, 2022. All noncontrolling interests relate to non-guarantor subsidiaries. \n\nNewmont and Newmont USA are primarily holding companies with no material operations, sources of income or assets other than equity interest in their subsidiaries and intercompany receivables or payables. Newmont USA&#8217;s primary investments are comprised of its 38.5% interest in NGM. For further information regarding these and our other operations, refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Results of Consolidated Operations, above. \n\nIn addition to equity interests in subsidiaries, the Obligor Group&#8217;s balance sheets consisted primarily of the following intercompany assets, intercompany liabilities and external debt. The remaining assets and liabilities of the Obligor Group are considered immaterial at December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 Obligor Group Newmont USA Current intercompany assets $ 13,982 $ 5,815 Non-current intercompany assets $ 520 $ 506 Current intercompany liabilities $ 13,118 $ 1,907 Current external debt $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Non-current external debt $ 5,564 $ &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nNewmont USA's subsidiary guarantees (the &#8220;subsidiary guarantees&#8221;) are general unsecured senior obligations of Newmont USA and rank equal in right of payment to all of Newmont USA's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of Newmont USA's future subordinated indebtedness. The subsidiary guarantees are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of Newmont USA to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Newmont USA had approximately $5,564 of consolidated indebtedness (including guaranteed debt), all of which relates to the guarantees of indebtedness of Newmont. \n\nUnder the terms of the subsidiary guarantees, holders of Newmont&#8217;s securities subject to such subsidiary guarantees will not be required to exercise their remedies against Newmont before they proceed directly against Newmont USA. \n\nNewmont USA will be released and relieved from all its obligations under the subsidiary guarantees in certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of a majority of the total voting power of the capital stock or other interests of Newmont USA (other than to Newmont or any of Newmont&#8217;s affiliates); \n\n&#8226; upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of Newmont USA (other than to Newmont or any of Newmont&#8217;s affiliates); or \n\n&#8226; upon such time as Newmont USA ceases to guarantee more than $75 aggregate principal amount of Newmont&#8217;s debt (at December 31, 2022, Newmont USA guaranteed $600 aggregate principal amount of debt of Newmont that did not contain a similar fall-away provision). \n\nNewmont&#8217;s debt securities are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of Newmont to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities of Newmont&#8217;s non-guarantor subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, (i) Newmont&#8217;s total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $6,132, none of which was secured (other than $561 of Lease and other financing obligations), and (ii) Newmont&#8217;s non-guarantor subsidiaries had $5,211 of total liabilities (including trade payables, but excluding intercompany, external debt and reclamation and remediation liabilities), which would have been structurally senior to Newmont&#8217;s debt securities. \n\nFor further information on our debt, refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur contractual obligations at December 31, 2022 are summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Current Non-Current \n\nDebt (1) \n\n$ 8,975 $ 231 $ 8,744 \n\nFinance lease and other financing obligations (2) \n\n749 94 655 \n\nRemediation and reclamation liabilities &#160;(3) \n\n8,720 495 8,225 \n\nEmployee-related benefits &#160;(4) \n\n626 127 499 \n\nUncertain income tax liabilities and interest &#160;(5) \n\n220 &#8212; 220 \n\nOperating leases and other obligations (6) \n\n137 29 108 \n\nMinimum royalty payments &#160;(7) \n\n41 26 15 \n\nPurchase obligations &#160;(8) \n\n969 276 693 \n\nOther &#160;(9) \n\n184 63 121 $ 20,621 $ 1,341 $ 19,280 ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Debt includes principal of $5,624 and estimated interest payments of $3,351 on Senior Notes, assuming no early extinguishment. \n\n(2) Finance lease and other financing obligations includes finance lease payments of $744 and additional payments of $5 for finance leases that have not yet commenced. \n\n(3) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these Reclamation and remediation liabilities are reflected here. For more information regarding reclamation and remediation liabilities, refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n(4) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefit s include severance, workers&#8217; participation, pension and other benefit plans. Pension plan and other benefit payments beyond 2032 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. \n\n(5) We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. \n\n(6) Operating lease and other obligations includes operating lease payments of $133 and additional payments of $4 for operating leases that have not yet commenced. \n\n(7) Minimum royalty payments are related to continuing operations and are presented net of recoverable amounts. \n\n(8) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. \n\n(9) Other includes service contracts and other obligations not recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Norte Abierto and Galore Creek deferred payment obligations accrued in Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities . \n\nEnvironmental \n\nOur mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. We perform a comprehensive review of our reclamation and remediation liabilities annually and review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Notably, Newmont is committed to the implementation of GISTM and all tailing storage facilities are expected to be in conformance with the GISTM by 2025. Compliance with GISTM remains on-going and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated sustaining costs and closure costs for existing operations and non-operating sites. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in connection with closure are becoming increasingly stringent. Compliance with water management and discharge quality remains dynamic and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated closure costs. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, $6,731 and $5,768, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing or development stage mineral properties, of which $482 and $213, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. \n\nIn addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $373 and $344 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $44 and $60, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. We spent $56, $43 and $25 during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former mining activities. \n\nReclamation and remediation adjustments during 2022 primarily related to (i) increased water management costs at portions of our Yanacocha and Porcupine site operations that are no longer in production and with no expected substantive future economic value (i.e., non-operating) (ii) increased costs due to closure plan design changes at our Porcupine site operations (iii) higher waste disposal costs and project execution delays at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites and (iv) higher estimated closure costs due to cost inflation. Reclamation and remediation adjustments during 2021 primarily related to (i) increased water treatment costs at non- \n\noperating portions of our Yanacocha site operation and (ii) higher estimated closure costs at various other non-operating sites arising from recent tailings management review and monitoring requirements set forth by GISTM. \n\nDuring the year ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, capital expenditures were approximately $29, $13, and $23, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. \n\nOur sustainability strategy is a foundational element in achieving our purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Sustainability and safety are integrated into the business at all levels of the organization through our global policies, standards, strategies, business plans and remuneration plans. For more information on the Company&#8217;s reclamation and remediation liabilities, refer to Notes 5 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of regulatory, tailings, water, climate and other environmental risks, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional information. \n\nForward-Looking Statements \n\nThe foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors that might impact forward-looking statements and other important information about forward-looking statements, refer to the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Part I, Item 1, Business and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by GAAP. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, we present the Non-GAAP financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nEarnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization \n\nManagement uses earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) and EBITDA adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period (&#8220;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221;) as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company&#8217;s operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management&#8217;s determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.

The Company believes the use of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) allows investors and analysts to understand the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the sale of products, by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Adjustments to continuing operations are presented before tax and net of our partners&#8217; noncontrolling interests, when applicable. The tax effect of adjustments is presented in the Tax effect of adjustments line and is calculated using the applicable regional tax rate.

Amounts are presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13 and $3, respectively. \n\n(17) Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share is calculated using diluted common shares, which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nManagement uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less Additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company&#8217;s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company&#8217;s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. \n\nThe presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company&#8217;s performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company&#8217;s definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,220 $ 4,279 $ 4,882 Less: Net cash used in (provided by) operating activities of discontinued operations (22) (13) 8 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations 3,198 4,266 4,890 Less: Additions to property, plant and mine development (2,131) (1,653) (1,302) Free Cash Flow $ 1,067 $ 2,613 $ 3,588 \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1) \n\n$ (2,983) $ (1,868) $ 91 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (2,356) $ (2,958) $ (1,680) ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities includes Additions to property, plant and mine development, which is included in the Company&#8217;s computation of Free Cash Flow. \n\nNet Debt \n\nManagement uses Net Debt to measure the Company&#8217;s liquidity and financial position. Net Debt is calculated as Debt and Lease and other financing obligations less Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits included in Time deposits and other investments , as presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits are subtracted from Debt and Lease and other financing obligations as these are highly liquid, low-risk investments and could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations. The Company believes the use of Net Debt allows investors and others to evaluate financial flexibility and strength of the Company's balance sheet. Net Debt is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate this measure differently. \n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net Debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Debt and Lease and other financing obligations , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to Net Debt. \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Debt $ 5,571 $ 5,652 Lease and other financing obligations 561 650 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (2,877) (4,992) \n\nLess: Time deposits (1) \n\n(829) &#8212; Net debt $ 2,426 $ 1,310 ##TABLE_END ____________________________ \n\n(1) Refer to Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. \n\nCosts applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce \n\nCosts applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and other metals by gold ounces or gold equivalent ounces sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. We believe that these measures provide additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility into the direct and indirect costs related to production, excluding depreciation and amortization, on a per ounce/gold equivalent ounce basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. \n\nThe following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. \n\n##TABLE_START Gold &#160;(1) \n\nGEO &#160;(2) \n\nYear Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 \n\nCosts applicable to sales (3) \n\n$ 5,423 $ 4,628 $ 4,408 $ 1,045 $ 807 $ 606 \n\nGold/GEO sold (thousand ounces) (4) \n\n5,812 5,897 5,831 1,275 1,258 1,062 \n\nCosts applicable to sales per ounce (5) \n\n$ 933 $ 785 $ 756 $ 819 $ 640 $ 571 ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Includes by-product credits of $109, $187 and $128 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\n(2) Includes by-product credits of $8, $7 and $2 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\n(3) Excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation . \n\n(4) Gold equivalent ounces is calculated as pounds or ounces produced multiplied by the ratio of the other metals price to the gold price, using Gold ($1,200/oz.), Copper ($3.25/lb.), Silver ($23.00/oz.), Lead ($0.95/lb.) and Zinc ($1.15/lb.) pricing for 2022, Gold ($1,200/oz.), Copper ($2.75/lb.), Silver ($22.00/oz.), Lead ($0.90/lb.) and Zinc ($1.05/lb.) pricing for 2021 and Gold ($1,200/oz.), Copper ($2.75/lb.), Silver ($16.00/oz.), Lead ($0.95/lb.) and Zinc ($1.20/lb.) pricing for 2020. \n\n(5) Per ounce measures may not recalculate due to rounding. \n\nAll-In Sustaining Costs \n\nCurrent GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, Newmont calculates All-In Sustaining Costs (&#8220;AISC&#8221;) based on the definition published by the World Gold Council. The World Gold Council is a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by gold mining companies around the world and a regulatory organization. \n\nAISC is a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations. We believe that AISC is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production. \n\nAISC amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in IFRS, or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company&#8217;s internal policies. \n\nThe following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the All-In Sustaining Costs measure: \n\nCosts applicable to sales . Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from CAS, such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation , which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of other metals. The other metals' CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and other metals is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the period. \n\nReclamation costs . Includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related ARC for the Company&#8217;s operating properties. Accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. \n\nAdvanced projects, research and development and exploration . Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. As these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations less incurred expenses related to the \n\ndevelopment of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. We also allocate these costs incurred at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals. \n\nGeneral and administrative . Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to supporting our corporate structure and fulfilling our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis. We allocate these costs to gold and other metals at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals. \n\nOther expense, net . For Other expense, net we include care and maintenance costs relating to direct operating costs incurred at the mine sites during the period that these sites were temporarily placed into care and maintenance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company&#8217;s non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. \n\nTreatment and refining costs . Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. \n\nSustaining capital and finance lease payments . We determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. We determined development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures and finance lease payments to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation and are excluded from the calculation of AISC. The classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company&#8217;s current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. We also allocate these costs incurred at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 Costs Applicable to Sales (1)(2)(3) \n\nReclamation Costs (4) \n\nAdvanced Projects, Research and Development and Exploration (5) \n\nGeneral and Administrative Other Expense, Net (6)(7) \n\nTreatment and Refining Costs Sustaining Capital and Lease Related Costs (8)(9) \n\nAll-In Sustaining Costs Ounces (000) Sold All-In Sustaining Costs Per oz.

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. We have identified the accounting estimates listed below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting estimates require the application of significant management judgment and are critical due to the significant level of estimation uncertainty regarding the assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with GAAP. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may materially differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\nExpenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. Facilities and equipment acquired as a part of a finance lease, build-to-suit or other financing arrangement are recorded based on the contractual lease terms. The facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the lesser of the lease terms or the estimated productive lives of such facilities. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. \n\nCosts incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the UOP method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds to be produced from proven and probable reserves. \n\nMajor mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production that are capitalized are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. \n\nCapitalized asset retirement costs incurred are amortized according to how the related assets are being depreciated. Open pit and underground mining costs are amortized using the UOP method based on recoverable ounces by source. Other costs, including leaching facilities, tailing facilities, and mills and other infrastructure costs, are amortized using the straight-line method over the same estimated future lives of the associated assets. \n\nThe calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions \n\nused in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. \n\nThe expected useful lives used in depreciation and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of depreciation and amortization calculations. \n\nCarrying value of stockpiles \n\nStockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. We generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of ore stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile&#8217;s average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed. \n\nWe record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals price assumptions that are applied to expected short-term (12 months or less) and long-term sales from stockpiles, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include declines in short-term or long-term metals prices, increases in costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized mineral grades and recovery rates. The significant assumption in determining the stockpile net realizable value for each mine site at December 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of $1,600 per ounce. A decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of the carrying value of our stockpiles of up to approximately $70. \n\nOther assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as long-term commodity prices and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates. If short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. \n\nRefer to Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding stockpiles. \n\nCarrying value of ore on leach pads \n\nOre on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold, copper or silver. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces or pounds are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold or silver or pound of copper on the leach pad. \n\nEstimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. \n\nAlthough the quantities of recoverable metal placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on our leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant assumption in determining the net realizable value for each mine site at December 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of $1,600 per ounce. A decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption would not result in a material write-down of the carrying value of the leach pads. \n\nOther assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term metal \n\nprices. If short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to net realizable value. \n\nRefer to Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding ore on leach pads. \n\nCarrying value of long-lived assets \n\nWe review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Significant negative industry or economic trends, adverse social or political developments, declines in our market capitalization, geotechnical difficulties, reduced estimates of future cash flows from our reporting segments or other disruptions to our business are a few examples of events that we monitor, as they could indicate that the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets, including development projects, may not be recoverable. In such cases, a recoverability test may be necessary to determine if an impairment charge is required. \n\nFor development projects, including our Conga project which is discussed further below, we review and evaluate changes to project plans and timing to determine continued technical, economic and social viability of the projects. If the Company determines to sell or abandon a project due to uncertainty from changes in circumstances related to technical, economic, social, political or community factors, or other evolving circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, then a recoverability test is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded. \n\nAn impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. Fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are primarily considered Level 3 fair value measurements. Occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. \n\nThe estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of our mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and our projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable reserve estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n\nThe significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at December 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of $1,600 per ounce. A decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, of up to approximately $2,800 before consideration of other value beyond proven and probable reserves which may significantly decrease the amount of any potential impairment charge. \n\nAs discussed above under Depreciation and amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves which could impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified measured, indicated and inferred resources could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. \n\nEvents that could result in additional impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in future metal prices, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, increases in future closure costs, and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site cash flows. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment annually as of December 31, 2022 and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. \n\nThe Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying value. At the Company's election or if it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using either the income approach utilizing estimates of discounted future cash flows or the market valuation approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Any impairment loss recognized in the \n\ncurrent period is not reversed in future periods. The Company recognizes its pro rata share of Goodwill and any subsequent goodwill impairment losses recorded by entities that are proportionately consolidated. \n\nWhen the income approach is utilized to determine fair value, the estimated cash flows used to assess the fair value of a reporting unit are derived from the Company&#8217;s current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management&#8217;s projections for long-term average metal prices. The significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at December 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of $1,600 per ounce. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.. \n\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. For testing purposes of our reporting units, management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. However, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, such items as: (i) a decrease in forecasted production levels if we are unable to realize the mineable reserves, resources and exploration potential at our mining properties and extend the life of mine (ii) increased production or capital costs (iii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions including the market price of metals and changes in the equity and debt markets or country specific factors which could result in higher discount rates, (iv) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates including increased corporate income or mining tax rates, and (v) negative changes in regulation, legislation, and political environments which could impact our ability to operate in the future. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units equal to or in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. \n\nCarrying value of Conga \n\nWe review and evaluate the Company&#8217;s Conga development project for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We have considered a variety of technical, economic, social and political developments related to the Conga project during our evaluation of impairment indicators since November 2011, when construction and development activities at the project were largely suspended. Project activities in recent years have focused on continued engagement with the local communities and maintaining and protecting existing project infrastructure and equipment through our active care and maintenance program. Although we have reclassified Conga reserves to resources and reallocated exploration and development capital to other projects, we continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the Conga project and improve social and political acceptance. While we have reprioritized the Yanacocha Sulfides project ahead of the Conga project, we have delayed the full-funds decision and are currently in the process of assessing project plan options for the Yanacocha Sulfides project. The Company also periodically updates the economic model for its Conga project to understand changes to the estimated capital costs, cash flows, and economic returns from the project. As of December 31, 2022, we have not identified events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the Conga project is not recoverable. \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nAll financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, except for the portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions such as commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are designated as effective cash flow hedges, whereby the changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. To the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations immediately. \n\nRefer to Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding derivative instruments. \n\nReclamation and remediation obligations \n\nThe Company records the estimated asset retirement obligations associated with operating and non-operating mine sites when an obligation is incurred and the fair value can be reasonably estimated. Fair value is measured as the present value of expected cash flow estimates, after considering inflation, our credit-adjusted risk-free rates and a market risk premium appropriate for our operations. Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on our best estimate of when the expected spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. Our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation \n\nto retire long-lived assets in the period incurred. Changes in reclamation estimates at non-operating mines where the mine or portion of the mine site has entered the closure phase and has no substantive future economic value are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Costs included in estimated asset retirement obligations are discounted to their present value and are estimated over a period of up to fifty years. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine. \n\nRemediation costs are accrued when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in remediation estimates at non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value and are estimated over a period of up to fifty years. \n\nAccounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the Company expects to incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying inputs and assumptions. Such changes, including, but not limited to, (i) changes to environmental laws and regulations, which could increase the scope and extent of work required, (ii) changes in the timing of reclamation and remediation activities, which could occur over an extended future period and (iii) changes in the methods and technology utilized to settle reclamation and remediation obligations, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nRefer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding reclamation and remediation obligations. \n\nIncome and mining taxes \n\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. We derive our deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. The financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate. We have exposure to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tax positions in certain jurisdictions, such movements are recorded within Income and mining tax benefit (expense) related to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as non-current uncertain tax positions, while foreign exchange fluctuations impacting current tax positions are recorded within Other income (loss), net as foreign currency exchange gains (losses). With respect to the earnings that we derive from the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of these consolidated companies. \n\nMining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. \n\nOur operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. We are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income and mining tax benefit (expense) . In certain jurisdictions, we must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is ultimately collectible. \n\nValuation of deferred tax assets \n\nOur deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. We record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. We review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence. \n\nCertain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. We look to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date or the expectation of future pretax losses and the existence and frequency of prior cumulative pretax losses. \n\nWe utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. However, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. We also consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis. \n\nOther factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; Earnings history; \n\n&#8226; Projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices; \n\n&#8226; The duration of statutory carry forward periods; \n\n&#8226; Prudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference; \n\n&#8226; Nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and \n\n&#8226; The sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors. \n\nThe Company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence is recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence including projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded in Peru. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. \n\nRefer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the valuation allowance. \n\nFor additional risk factors that could impact the Company&#8217;s ability to realize the deferred tax assets, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (dollars in millions, except per ounce and per pound amounts). \n\nMetal Prices \n\nChanges in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the USD; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability; and global mine production levels. Changes in the market price of copper, silver, lead and zinc also affect our profitability and cash flow. These metals are traded on established international exchanges and prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. The Company does not currently hold instruments that are designated to hedge against the potential impacts due to market price changes in metals. Consideration of these impacts are discussed below. \n\nDecreases in the market price of metals can significantly affect the value of our product inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value, as well as significantly impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets and goodwill. For information concerning the sensitivity of our impairment analysis over long-lived assets and goodwill to changes in metal price, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within Item 7, MD&#38;A, and Notes 2, 6 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nNet realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of our stockpiles, leach pads and product inventory include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and product inventory adjustments for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2022 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, and the following short-term and long-term assumptions: \n\n##TABLE_START Short-term Long-term Gold price (per ounce) $ 1,726 $ 1,600 Copper price (per pound) $ 3.63 $ 3.50 Silver price (per ounce) $ 21.17 $ 20.00 Lead price (per pound) $ 0.95 $ 1.05 Zinc price (per pound) $ 1.36 $ 1.30 AUD to USD exchange rate $ 0.66 $ 0.75 CAD to USD exchange rate $ 0.74 $ 0.80 MXN to USD exchange rate $ 0.05 $ 0.04 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe net realizable value measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. For information concerning the sensitivity of our stockpiles and ore on leach pads to changes in metal price, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within Item 7, MD&#38;A. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nWe are subject to interest rate risk related to the fair value of our senior notes which consist of fixed rates. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. The terms of our fixed rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity which could be material. Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information pertaining to the fair value of our fixed rate debt. \n\nForeign Currency \n\nIn addition to our operations in the U.S., we have significant operations and/or assets in Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. All of our operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc production based on USD metal prices. Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic conditions. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins, cash flow and Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. \n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact to Costs applicable to sales per ounce arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement to local currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022 in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement would result in an approximate $33 increase to Costs applicable to sales per ounce at December 31, 2022. \n\nHedging \n\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into A$574 of AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts to mitigate variability in the USD functional cash flows related to the AUD-denominated capital expenditures expected to be incurred in 2023 and 2024 during the construction and development phase of the Tanami Expansion 2 project included in the Company's Australia segment. The Company has designated the forward contracts as foreign currency cash flow hedges against the forecasted AUD-denominated Tanami Expansion 2 capital expenditures. \n\nBy using hedges, we are affected by market risk, credit risk, and market liquidity risk. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or be subject to any margin calls on our derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2022, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the AUD foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analysis covered all of our AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on AUD market rates in effect at December 31, 2022. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in an approximate decrease in the fair value of the hedging derivative instruments of $40 at December 31, 2022. \n\nCredit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties. \n\nMarket liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breaches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time. \n\nRefer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative instruments. \n\nCommodity Price Exposure \n\nOur provisional concentrate sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the respective metal concentrates at the prevailing indices&#8217; prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. \n\nWe perform an analysis on the provisional concentrate sales to determine the potential impact to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders for each 10% change to the average price on the provisional concentrate sales subject to final pricing over the next several months. Refer below for our analysis as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Provisionally Priced Sales Subject to Final Pricing Average Provisional Price (per ounce/pound) Effect of 10% change in Average Price (millions) Market Closing \n\nSettlement Price (1) \n\n(per ounce/pound) \n\nGold (ounces, in thousands) 159 $ 1,817 $ 19 $ 1,814 Copper (pounds, in millions) 37 $ 3.80 $ 10 $ 3.80 Silver (ounces, in millions) 4 $ 23.86 $ 6 $ 23.95 Lead (pounds, in millions) 26 $ 1.05 $ 2 $ 1.06 Zinc (pounds, in millions) 74 $ 1.35 $ 7 $ 1.37 ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) The closing settlement price as of December 31, 2022 is determined utilizing the London Metal Exchange for copper, lead and zinc and the London Bullion Market Association for gold and silver. \n\n"

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe did not audit the financial statements of Nevada Gold Mines LLC, a 38.5% owned investment which is proportionately consolidated, which reflects total assets constituting 19% and 19% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and sales constituting 18%, 19%, and 21% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Nevada Gold Mines LLC, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. ##TABLE_START Reclamation liabilities \n\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Notes 2, 5 and 25 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s mining and exploration activities are subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Reclamation obligations are recognized when incurred and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Reclamation liabilities are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. \n\nAuditing management&#8217;s accounting for reclamation liabilities was especially challenging, as significant judgment is required by the Company to estimate required cash flows to meet obligations established by mining permit, local statutes and promissory estoppel at the end of mine life as well as estimation uncertainty inherent in the cash flows. The significant judgment was primarily related to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the extent of future reclamation activities and related costs. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company&#8217;s accounting for reclamation liabilities, including controls over management&#8217;s review of estimated future costs, premiums for uncertainty and the reclamation liability calculation. \n\nTo test the reclamation liabilities, among other procedures, we evaluated the methodology, significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its estimate. To assess the estimates of reclamation activities and cash flows, we evaluated significant changes from the prior estimate, verified consistency between timing of reclamation activities and projected mine life, compared anticipated costs across the Company&#8217;s mines, verified cost rates against third-party information or internal cost records and recalculated management&#8217;s estimate. We also evaluated the significant assumptions included in the fair value calculation, including market risk premium, cost inflation, and credit-adjusted risk-free rate. We involved our reclamation specialists to interview members of the Company&#8217;s engineering staff, assess the completeness of the mine reclamation estimates with respect to meeting mine closure and post closure requirements, and evaluate the reasonableness of the engineering estimates and assumptions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START \n\nImpairment of goodwill \n\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Notes 2, 6, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, management conducts a goodwill impairment assessment annually at December 31, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the use of the income approach using estimates of future cash flows attributable to the respective reporting units. As a result of the annual impairment assessment, the Company recognized $800 million of goodwill impairment charges related to the Cerro Negro and Porcupine reporting units. \n\nAuditing management&#8217;s fair value assessment was especially challenging, as significant judgment is required by the company to estimate future cash flows attributable to the respective reporting units, and changes in management&#8217;s assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of impairment charge, or both. The estimated future cash flows used to determine the fair values of reporting units are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management&#8217;s projections for long-term metal prices, and proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the assessment of goodwill impairment, including those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to management&#8217;s development of future cash flows and the cost of capital. \n\nTo test the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, the evaluation of significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its estimate. To assess the reasonableness of estimated future cash flows, we compared the Company&#8217;s short-term and long-term metal price projections to third-party sources and verified the consistency between management&#8217;s projections and the Company&#8217;s qualified person&#8217;s estimate of proven and probable reserves and resources. We also evaluated management&#8217;s projections, including timing and costs to develop and produce the reserves, against historical operating results, and evaluated management&#8217;s ability to accurately forecast future cash flows by comparing actual results to historical forecasts. We involved our valuation specialist to assist in reviewing the valuation methods selected by management. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2014. \n\nDenver, Colorado \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Board of Managers and Members of Nevada Gold Mines LLC \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Nevada Gold Mines LLC and its subsidiaries (together, the Joint Venture) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of changes in members&#8217; equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements) (not presented herein). We also have audited the Joint Venture&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Joint Venture as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Joint Venture maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Joint Venture&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (not presented herein). Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Joint Venture&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Joint Venture&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Joint Venture in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nAn entity&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entity&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Board of Managers (acting in a role equivalent to the audit committee) and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nQualitative Goodwill Impairment Assessment \n\nAs described in note 2 to the Joint Venture&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, the Joint Venture&#8217;s goodwill balance was $696 million (at a 100 percent economic interest) as of December 31, 2022. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and assessed for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The Joint Venture has five reporting units. The Joint Venture&#8217;s management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (qualitative goodwill impairment assessment). If it is determined that the fair value is more likely than not to be lower than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Management uses judgment in assessing the qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, including significant adverse changes to future gold prices, future operating and capital costs, future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources. Management uses future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by qualified persons (management&#8217;s specialists). \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are the judgment by management in assessing the qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is required, and a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s assessment of qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit with respect to significant adverse changes to future gold prices, future operating and capital costs, future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s qualitative goodwill impairment assessment. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit with respect to significant adverse changes to future gold prices and future operating and capital costs by (i) comparing gold prices to external industry data; (ii) comparing operating and capital costs to recent actual operating and capital costs incurred; and (iii) considering consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. The work of management&#8217;s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources. As a basis for using this work, the management&#8217;s specialists&#8217; qualifications were understood and the Joint Venture&#8217;s relationship with management&#8217;s specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by management&#8217;s specialists, tests of the data used by management&#8217;s specialists, and an evaluation of management&#8217;s specialists&#8217; findings. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nChartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants \n\nToronto, Canada \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Joint Venture&#8217;s auditor since 2019. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions, except per share) \n\nSales (Note 4) \n\n$ 11,915 &#160;

The Company purchased Sumitomo's 5 % interest during 2022. Refer to Note 1 for further information. \n\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nNOTE 1 THE COMPANY \n\nNewmont Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Newmont,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) predominantly operate in the mining industry, focused on the production of and exploration for gold properties, some of which may contain copper, silver, zinc, lead or other metals. The Company has significant operations and/or assets in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. The cash flow and profitability of the Company&#8217;s operations are significantly affected by the market price of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc. The prices of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. \n\nGT Gold \n\nIn May 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85.1 % interest of GT Gold Corporation (&#8220;GT Gold&#8221;) for cash consideration, including related transaction costs, of $ 326 . Immediately prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 14.9 % equity interest in GT Gold which was accounted for as a marketable equity security. The asset acquisition resulted in total consideration of $ 378 , including non-cash consideration of $ 52 . The non-cash consideration represents the fair value of the 14.9 % GT Gold investment held by the Company on the acquisition date. The total consideration paid was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, which primarily consisted of mineral interests of $ 590 and a related deferred tax liability of $ 211 . \n\nLoss on Assets Held for Sale \n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the Company entered into a binding agreement to sell certain equipment and assets originally acquired for the Conga project in Peru within our South America segment (the \"Conga mill assets\") for total cash proceeds of $ 68 . Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the sale is expected to close upon the delivery of the assets and receipt of the final payment at which time title and control of the assets will transfer. Upon entering the binding agreement, the Conga mill assets were reclassified as held for sale and remeasured at fair value less costs to sell. As a result, a loss of $ 571 was recognized and included in Loss on assets held for sale on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has received payments of $ 29 included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\nNewmont has a 75.0 % economic interest in Suriname Gold project C.V. (&#8220;Merian&#8221;), with the remaining interests held by Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (&#8220;Staatsolie&#8221;), a company wholly owned by the Republic of Suriname. Newmont consolidates Merian, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Newmont Suriname LLC., in its Consolidated Financial Statements as the primary beneficiary of Merian, which is a variable interest entity. For the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $( 59 ), $( 81 ) and $( 90 ) of Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests related to Merian. \n\nAt December 31, 2021, Newmont held a 51.35 % ownership interest in Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (\"Yanacocha\"), with 43.65 % owned by Compa&#241;ia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (&#8220;Buenaventura&#8221;) and 5 % owned by Summit Global Management II VB, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation (&#8220;Sumitomo&#8221;). The Company consolidated Yanacocha in its Consolidated Financial Statements under the voting interest model. During 2022, the Company acquired Buenaventura's and Sumitomo's ownership which resulted in the Company holding 100 % ownership interest in Yanacocha at December 31, 2022. Refer to \"Yanacocha transaction\" and \"Contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest\" below for further information. For the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $( 1 ), $ 1,014 and $ 128 of Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests related to Yanacocha. \n\nYanacocha transaction \n\nAt December 31, 2021, Buenaventura held 43.65 % ownership interest in Yanacocha. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Buenaventura&#8217;s 43.65 % noncontrolling interest in Yanacocha (the &#8220;Yanacocha Transaction&#8221;) for $ 300 cash consideration, certain royalties on any production from other future potential projects, and contingent payments of up to $ 100 tied to higher metal prices, achieving commercial production at the Yanacocha Sulfides project and resolution on the outstanding Yanacocha tax dispute. The Yanacocha Transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction, resulting in a decrease to additional paid-in-capital and no gain or loss recognition. Upon close of the Yanacocha Transaction, the Company&#8217;s ownership interest in Yanacocha increased to 95 %. The Company acquired the remaining 5 % ownership interest from Sumitomo in the second quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest\" below for further information. \n\nConcurrent with the Yanacocha Transaction, the Company sold its 46.94 % ownership interest in Minera La Zanja S.R.L. (\"La Zanja\"), accounted for as an equity method investment with a carrying value of $ &#8212; as of December 31, 2021. Per the terms of the sale, the Company sold its interest in La Zanja to Buenaventura, the parent company of La Zanja, in exchange for royalties on potential future production from the La Zanja operation and contributed cash of $ 45 to be used exclusively for reclamation costs at the La Zanja operation. Upon close of the sale during the first quarter of 2022, the Company recognized a $ 45 loss on sale of its equity interest, included in Gain on asset and investment sales, net . \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nContingently redeemable noncontrolling interest \n\nIn 2018, Sumitomo acquired a 5 % interest in Yanacocha for $ 48 in cash. Under the terms of the acquisition, Sumitomo had the option to require Yanacocha to repurchase the interest for the $ 48 , which was placed in escrow. In March 2022, Sumitomo exercised this option, and in June 2022, the Company acquired the remaining 5 % ownership interest held by Sumitomo in exchange for cash consideration of $ 48 , resulting in the Company holding 100 % ownership interest in Yanacocha. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations includes results related to the Batu Hijau and Elang contingent consideration assets associated with the sale of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara in 2016 and a retained royalty obligation (&#8220;Holt royalty obligation&#8221;) to Royal Gold, Inc. for production on the Holt-McDermott property owned by Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd (\"Kirkland\"). In 2020, the Company and Kirkland signed an agreement, in which the Company purchased an option (the &#8220;Holt option&#8221;) from Kirkland for the mining and mineral rights subject to the Holt royalty obligation for $ 75 , effectively reducing the Holt royalty obligation to $ &#8212; . If exercised, the Holt option will allow the Company to prevent Kirkland from mining minerals subject to the Holt royalty obligation. \n\nFor the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded income (expense) of $ 30 , $ 57 and $ 163 , net of a tax benefit (expense) of $( 4 ), $( 10 ) and $( 44 ), respectively, within discontinued operations. The Company received (paid) $ 22 , $ 13 and $( 8 ) for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to discontinued operations. Refer to contingent consideration assets in Note 14 for additional information. \n\nNOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nRisks and Uncertainties \n\nAs a global mining company, the Company&#8217;s revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing metal prices, primarily for gold, but also for copper, silver, lead and zinc. Historically, the commodity markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of reserves that the Company can economically produce. The carrying value of the Company&#8217;s Property, plant and mine development , net; Inventories; Stockpiles and ore on leach pads; Investments; Deferred income tax assets; and Goodwill are particularly sensitive to the outlook for commodity prices. A decline in the Company&#8217;s price outlook from current levels could result in material impairment charges related to these assets. \n\nThe continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting significant inflation experienced globally, as well as the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, have been and are expected to continue to adversely affect the Company. Although the Company does not currently have operations in Ukraine, Russia or other parts of Europe, impacts arising from Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine include the Company&#8217;s ability to complete the sale of assets currently classified as held for sale within one year as originally planned. In addition, these factors could have further potential short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts on the Company including, but not limited to, volatility in commodity prices and the prices for gold and other metals, changes in the equity and debt markets or country specific factors adversely impacting discount rates, significant cost inflation impacts on production, capital and asset retirement costs, logistical challenges, workforce interruptions and financial market disruptions, as well as potential impacts to estimated costs and timing of projects. In light of these challenging conditions, the Company recorded material long-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 6 for further information. \n\nAdditionally, as further response to the current market conditions, record inflation rates, the rising prices for commodities and raw materials, prolonged supply chain disruptions, competitive labor markets, and consideration of capital allocation, in the third quarter of 2022 the Company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. While the Company has extended the timeline of the full-funds decision, assessment of the project remains a priority in Peru as the Company continues to advance engineering and long-term procurement activities. The delay of the Yanacocha Sulfides project is intended to focus funds on current operations and other capital commitments while management assesses execution and project options, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure. To the extent that assessment determines that the project is no longer sufficiently profitable or economically feasible under the Company&#8217;s internal requirements, it would result in negative modifications to our proven and probable reserves. Additionally, should the Company ultimately decide to forgo the development of Yanacocha Sulfides, the current carrying value of the assets under construction and other long-lived assets of the Yanacocha operations could become impaired and the timing of certain closure activities would be accelerated. As of December 31, 2022, the Yanacocha operations have total long-lived assets of approximately $ 1,030 , inclusive of approximately $ 621 of assets under construction related to Yanacocha Sulfides. Refer also to our risk factors under the titles &#8220;Estimates relating to projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated&#8221; and &#8221;Our long-lived assets and goodwill could become impaired, which could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations&#8221; included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further information. \n\nAdditionally, the Company continues to hold the Conga project in Peru, which we do not currently anticipate developing in the next ten years as we continue to assess Yanacocha sulfides; accordingly, the Conga project remains in care and maintenance. Should \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nwe be unable to develop the Conga project or conclude that future development is not in the best interest of the business, we may consider other alternatives for the project, which may result in a future impairment charge for the remaining assets. The total assets at Conga were $ 900 at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nThe Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impacts to its business plans, asset retirement cost updates, operations, estimated capital expenditures and timing of other key development projects related to the current and ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. Depending on the duration and extent of COVID-19, ongoing global developments and increasing inflationary pressures, these factors could materially impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and could result in material impairment charges to the Company&#8217;s Property, plant and mine development, net ; Inventories ; Stockpiles and ore on leach pads ; Investments ; Deferred income tax assets ; and Goodwill . \n\nThe Cerro Negro mine, located in Argentina, is a U.S. dollar functional currency entity. Argentina&#8217;s central bank has enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, including requiring the Company to convert U.S. dollar proceeds from metal sales to local currency and restricting payments to foreign-related entities denominated in foreign currency, such as dividends or distributions to the parent and related companies. We continue to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk and the limitations of repatriating cash to the United States. Currently, these currency controls are not expected to impact the Company's ability to repay its debt obligations or declare dividends. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information used is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Actual results could differ from these estimates. \n\nThe more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations and units-of-production amortization calculations; environmental remediation, reclamation and closure obligations; estimates of recoverable gold and other minerals in stockpile and leach pad inventories; estimates of fair value for certain reporting units and asset impairments (including impairments of long-lived assets, goodwill and investments); write-downs of inventory, stockpiles and ore on leach pads to net realizable value; post-employment, post-retirement and other employee benefit liabilities; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; provisional amounts related to income tax effects of newly enacted tax laws; provisional amounts related to uncertain tax positions; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination; reserves for contingencies and litigation; and the fair value and accounting treatment of financial instruments including marketable and other equity securities and derivative instruments. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results will differ from those amounts estimated in these financial statements. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Newmont Corporation, more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries that it controls and variable interest entities where it is the primary beneficiary. The proportionate consolidation method is used for investments in which the Company has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities and operations and for certain unincorporated joint ventures in the extractive industry. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Equity method accounting is applied for certain entities where the Company does not have control, but does have significant influence over the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; operations and financial performance. The functional currency for the majority of the Company&#8217;s operations is the U.S. dollar. \n\nThe Company follows the ASC guidance for identification and reporting of entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. The guidance defines such entities as Variable Interest Entities. \n\nBusiness Combination and Asset Acquisition Accounting \n\nThe Company applies a screen test to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination. \n\nWhen an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business combination because either: (i) substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, or group of similar identified assets, or (ii) the acquired entity does not have an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the Company accounts for the acquisition as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized, but rather, any excess purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nassets as of the acquisition date and any direct acquisition-related transaction costs are capitalized as part of the purchase consideration. \n\nWhen an acquisition is accounted for as a business combination, the Company recognizes and measures the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, while transaction and integration costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase consideration in excess of the aggregate fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. For material acquisitions, the Company engages independent appraisers to assist with the determination of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest, if any, and goodwill, based on recognized business valuation methodologies. An income, market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest, if any, in a business combination. The income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using discrete financial forecasts, long-term growth rates, appropriate discount rates, and expected future capital requirements. The market valuation method uses prices paid for a similar asset by other purchasers in the market, normalized for any differences between the assets. The cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at the time of the acquisition adjusted for depreciation and economic and functional obsolescence of the asset. The fair value of property, plant and mine development is estimated to include the fair value of asset retirement costs of related long-lived tangible assets. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the period the adjustment arises. \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash \n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Because of the short maturity of these investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are held in overnight bank deposits or are invested in United States Treasury securities and money market securities. Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other current or non-current assets. Restricted cash is held primarily for the purpose of settling asset retirement obligations. \n\nTime Deposits and Other Investments \n\nThe Company's time deposits and other investments primarily include time deposits with an original maturity of more than three months but less than one year. These time deposits are carried at amortized cost. Accrued interest is recorded in Other income (loss), net . \n\nStockpiles, Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories \n\nAs described below, costs that are incurred in or benefit the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on current and long-term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories to net realizable value are reported as a component of Costs applicable to sales and Depreciation and amortization . The current portion of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories is determined based on the expected amounts to be processed within the next 12 months and utilize the short-term metal price assumption in estimating net realizable value. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories not expected to be processed within the next 12 months are classified as non-current and utilize the long-term metal price assumption in estimating net realizable value. The major classifications are as follows: \n\nStockpiles \n\nStockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. The Company generally processes the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of metal stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data) and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs incurred including applicable overhead and depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile&#8217;s average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed. Carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly, in accordance with the above. \n\nOre on Leach Pads \n\nOre on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold or silver or extract the copper. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces or pounds are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold or silver or pound of copper on the leach \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\npad. Estimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50 % and 95 % of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. \n\nAlthough the quantities of recoverable metal placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, the Company&#8217;s operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. \n\nIn-process Inventory \n\nIn-process inventories represent material that is currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the specific processing facility, but include mill in-circuit, flotation, leach and carbon-in-leach. In-process material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of the respective processing plants. In-process inventories are valued at the lower of the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines, stockpiles and/or leach pads, plus the in-process conversion costs, including applicable amortization relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process or net realizable value. \n\nPrecious Metals Inventory \n\nPrecious metals inventories include gold dor&#233; and/or gold bullion. Precious metals that result from the Company&#8217;s mining and processing activities are valued at the lower of the average cost of the respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the refining process, plus applicable refining costs or net realizable value. \n\nConcentrate Inventory \n\nConcentrate inventories represent gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper concentrate available for shipment or in transit for further processing when the sales process has not been completed. The Company values concentrate inventory at average cost, including an allocable portion of support costs and amortization. Costs are added and removed to the concentrate inventory based on metal in the concentrate and are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. \n\nMaterials and Supplies \n\nMaterials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and freight. \n\nProperty, Plant and Mine Development \n\nFacilities and Equipment \n\nExpenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and recorded at cost. Facilities and equipment acquired as a part of a finance lease, build-to-suit or other financing arrangement are capitalized and recorded based on the contractual lease terms. The facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such capitalized costs over the estimated productive lives of such facilities. These estimated productive lives do not exceed the related estimated mine lives, which are based on proven and probable reserves. \n\nMine Development \n\nMine development costs include engineering and metallurgical studies, drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore body, the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways, shafts, lateral access, drifts, ramps and other infrastructure at underground mines. Costs incurred before mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and classified as Exploration or Advanced projects, research and development expense. Capitalization of mine development project costs that meet the definition of an asset begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves. \n\nDrilling and related costs are capitalized for an ore body where proven and probable reserves exist and the activities are directed at obtaining additional information on the ore body or converting measured, indicated and inferred resources to proven and probable reserves. All other drilling and related costs are expensed as incurred. Drilling costs incurred during the production phase for operational ore control are allocated to inventory costs and then included as a component of Costs applicable to sales . \n\nThe cost of removing overburden and waste materials to access the ore body at an open pit mine prior to the production phase are referred to as &#8220;pre-stripping costs.&#8221; Pre-stripping costs are capitalized during the development of an open pit mine. Where \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nmultiple open pits exist at a mining complex utilizing common processing facilities, pre-stripping costs are capitalized at each pit. The removal, production, and sale of de minimis saleable materials may occur during the development phase of an open pit mine and are assigned incremental mining costs related to the removal of that material. \n\nThe production phase of an open pit mine commences when saleable minerals, beyond a de minimis amount, are produced. Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that are included as a component of inventory to be recognized in Costs applicable to sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. \n\nMine development costs are amortized using the units-of-production method based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves. To the extent that these costs benefit an entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated life of the ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that area are amortized over the estimated life of that specific ore block or area. \n\nUnderground development costs are capitalized as incurred. Costs incurred before mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and classified as Exploration or Advanced projects, research and development expense. Capitalization of mine development project costs that meet the definition of an asset begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves. \n\nMineral Interests \n\nMineral interests include acquired interests in production, development and exploration stage properties. Mineral interests are capitalized at their fair value at the acquisition date, either as an individual asset purchase or as part of a business combination. Mineral interests in the development and exploration stage are not amortized until the underlying property is converted to the production stage, at which point the mineral interests are amortized over the estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves. \n\nThe value of such assets is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineral interests believed to be contained in such properties. Production stage mineral interests represent interests in operating properties that contain proven and probable reserves and are amortized using the units-of-production method based on the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves. Development stage mineral interests represent interests in properties under development that contain proven and probable reserves. Exploration stage mineral interests represent interests in properties that are believed to potentially contain mineral resources consisting of (i) mineral resources within pits; mineral resources with insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable reserves; and mineral resources in close proximity to proven and probable reserves; (ii) around-mine exploration potential not immediately adjacent to existing reserves and mineralization, but located within the immediate mine area; (iii) other mine-related exploration potential that is not part of current resources and is comprised mainly of material outside of the immediate mine area; (iv) greenfield exploration potential that is not associated with any other production, development or exploration stage property, as described above; or (v) any acquired right to explore or extract a potential mineral deposit. The Company&#8217;s mineral rights generally are enforceable regardless of whether proven and probable reserves have been established. In certain limited situations, the nature of a mineral right changes from an exploration right to a mining right upon the establishment of proven and probable reserves. The Company has the ability and intent to renew mineral interests where the existing term is not sufficient to recover all identified and valued proven and probable reserves and/or undeveloped mineral resources. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment annually as of December 31 and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. \n\nThe Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying value. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using either the income approach utilizing estimates of discounted future cash flows or the market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company recognizes its pro rata share of goodwill and any subsequent goodwill impairment losses recorded by entities that are proportionately consolidated. \n\nThe estimated cash flows used to assess the fair value of a reporting unit are derived from the Company&#8217;s current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management&#8217;s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; capital investment; proven and probable mineral reserve estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve and measured, indicated and inferred resource estimates; estimated future closure costs; and the use of appropriate discount rates. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n\nThe Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment, and their carrying amounts. Fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. Occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. \n\nThe estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of the Company&#8217;s mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management&#8217;s projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserve estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve and measured, indicated and inferred resource estimates; estimated future closure costs; and the use of appropriate discount rates. \n\nIn estimating undiscounted cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of undiscounted cash flows from other asset groups. The Company&#8217;s estimates of undiscounted cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual cash flows may differ significantly from estimates, as actual produced reserves, metal prices, commodity-based and other costs, and closure costs are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties. \n\nInvestments \n\nManagement classifies investments at the acquisition date and re-evaluates the classification at each balance sheet date and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a change in the Company&#8217;s ability to exercise significant influence. The ability to exercise significant influence is typically presumed when the Company possesses 20% or more of the voting interests in the investee. The Company accounts for its investments in stock of other entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control, using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company increases its investment for contributions made and records its proportionate share of net earnings, declared dividends and partnership distributions based on the most recently available financial statements of the investee. To the extent that there is a basis difference between the amount invested and the underlying equity in the net assets of an equity investment, the Company allocates such differences between tangible and intangible assets. This basis difference is being amortized into Equity income (loss) of affiliates over the remaining estimated useful lives of the underlying tangible and intangible net assets. Equity method investments are included in Investments . \n\nContributions made to equity method investees at times are in the form of loan agreements. Loans provided to equity method investees that are made based on the Company's proportionate ownership percentage are accounted for as &#8220;in-substance capital contributions&#8221; and are treated as an increase to the investment. Principal and interest payments received on loans treated as in-substance capital contributions are assessed under the cumulative earnings approach to determine if the distribution received represents a return on capital or a return of capital. Return on capital distributions are recorded as an operating cash flow whereas return of capital distributions are recorded as an investing cash flow. Loans provided to equity method investees that are not made on a proportionate basis are accounted for as a loan receivable and do not increase the investment. Principal payments received on loans not treated as an in-substance capital contribution are accounted for as a reduction to the loan receivable and interest received is recorded as interest income. \n\nThe Company evaluates its equity method investments for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is an other-than-temporary decline in the value of the investment. Declines in fair value that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are charged to Other income (loss), net . \n\nAdditionally, the Company has certain marketable equity and debt securities and other equity securities. Marketable equity securities are measured primarily at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded in Other income (loss), net . Certain other equity securities are accounted for under the measurement alternative (cost less impairment, adjusted for any qualifying observable price changes) when fair value is not readily determinable. The Company accounts for its restricted marketable debt securities as available-for-sale securities. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, net of taxes, are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Total equity , unless an impairment is deemed to be credit-related. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to Other income (loss), net . \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nThe fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The changes in fair value of these hedges are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . Amounts deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to income when the hedged transaction has occurred in \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nthe same income statement line where the earnings effect of the hedged item is presented. Cash transactions related to the Company&#8217;s derivative contracts accounted for as hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nWhen derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are settled, accelerated or restructured before the maturity date of the contracts, the related amount in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the settlement date is deferred and reclassified to earnings, when the originally designated hedged transaction impacts earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item, unless the underlying hedge transaction becomes probable of not occurring, at which time related amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings immediately. \n\nContingent consideration assets and liabilities \n\nContingent consideration assets and liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration to be received or paid by the Company in conjunction with various sales of assets and investments with future payment contingent upon certain milestones. These contingent consideration assets and liabilities are accounted for at fair value using discounted cash flow models and consist of financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative, but are not designated for hedge accounting under ASC 815. \n\nDebt \n\nThe Company carries its Senior Notes at amortized cost. \n\nDebt issuance costs and debt premiums and discounts, which are included in Debt, and unrealized gains or losses related to cash flow hedges using treasury rate lock contracts and forward starting swap contracts, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective Senior Notes as a component of Interest expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nWhen repurchasing its debt, the Company records the resulting gain or loss as well as the accelerated portion of related debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts, and any unrealized gains or losses from the associated treasury rate lock contracts and/or associated forward starting swap contracts, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , in Other income (loss), net . \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company determines if a contractual arrangement represents or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Other non-current assets and Other current and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Property, plant and mine development, net and current and non-current Lease and other financing obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nOperating and finance lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. Leases acquired in a business combination are also measured based on the present value of the remaining leases payments, as if the acquired lease were a new lease at the acquisition date. When the rate implicit to the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of the future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date and represents the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made and lease incentives received prior to the commencement date. Operating lease ROU assets also include any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent when the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term. The ROU assets and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements that include both lease and non-lease components. The Company accounts for each separate lease component and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component for the majority of its asset classes. Additionally, for certain lease arrangements that involve leases of similar assets, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the underlying ROU assets and lease liabilities. \n\nContingently Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest \n\nCertain noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities meet the definition of redeemable financial instruments if the ability to redeem the interest is outside of the control of the consolidating entity. In such cases, these financial instruments are classified outside of permanent equity (referred to as temporary equity). \n\nCommon Stock \n\nIn July 2021, Newmont filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under which it can issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices, subject to the limitations of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company's certification of incorporation and bylaws. It also includes the ability to resell an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nTreasury Stock \n\nThe Company records repurchases of common shares as Treasury stock at cost and records any subsequent retirements of treasury shares at cost. When treasury shares are retired, the Company&#8217;s policy is to allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to both Retained earnings and Additional paid-in capital using settlement-date accounting. The portion allocated to Additional paid-in capital is calculated on a pro rata basis of the shares to be retired and the total shares issued and outstanding as of the date of the retirement. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased and retired approximately &#8212; million, 9 million and 10 million shares of its common stock for $ &#8212; , $ 525 and $ 521 , respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company withheld 0.6 million, 0.6 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively, for payments of employee withholding taxes related to the vesting of stock awards. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nNewmont generates revenue by selling gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc produced from its mining operations. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the Company&#8217;s operating segments. \n\nThe majority of the Company&#8217;s Sales come from the sale of refined gold; however, the end product at the Company&#8217;s gold operations is generally dor&#233; bars. Dor&#233; is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Dor&#233; is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95 % gold. Under the terms of the Company&#8217;s refining agreements, the dor&#233; bars are refined for a fee, and the Company&#8217;s share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to its bullion account. Gold from dor&#233; bars credited to its bullion account is typically sold to banks or refiners. \n\nA portion of gold sold from certain sites is sold in the form of concentrate. The Company&#8217;s Sales also come from the sale of copper, silver, lead, and zinc. Sales from these metals are generally in the form of concentrate, which is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. \n\nGenerally, if a metal expected to be mined represents more than 10 % to 20 % of the life of mine sales value of all the metal expected to be mined, co-product accounting is applied. When the Company applies co-product accounting at an operation, revenue is recognized for each co-product metal sold, and shared costs applicable to sales are allocated based on the relative sales values of the co-product metals produced. Generally, if metal expected to be mined is less than the 10 % to 20 % of the life of mine sales value, by-product accounting is applied. Revenues from by-product sales, which are immaterial, are credited to Costs applicable to sales as a by-product credit. Silver, lead and zinc are produced as co-products at Pe&#241;asquito. Copper is produced as a co-product at Boddington. Aside from the co-product sales at Boddington and Pe&#241;asquito, copper and silver produced at other Newmont sites are by-product metals. \n\nGold Sales from Dor&#233; Production \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue for gold from dor&#233; production when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring gold inventory to the customer, which generally occurs upon transfer of gold bullion credits as this is the point at which the customer obtains control the ability to direct the use and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits of ownership of the asset. \n\nThe Company generally recognizes the sale of gold bullion credits when the credits are delivered to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the agreed upon market price and the number of ounces delivered. Payment is due upon delivery of gold bullion credits to the customer&#8217;s account. \n\nSales from Concentrate Production \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue for gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc from concentrate production, net of treatment and refining charges, when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring control of the concentrate to the customer. This generally occurs as material passes over the vessel's rail at the port of loading based on the date from the bill of lading, as the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the material and the customer has the risk of loss. Newmont has elected to account for shipping and handling costs for concentrate contracts as fulfillment activities and not as promised goods or services; therefore these activities are not considered separate performance obligations. \n\nThe Company generally sells metal concentrate based on the monthly average market price for a future month, dependent on the relevant contract, following the month in which the delivery to the customer takes place. The amount of revenue recognized for concentrates is initially recorded on a provisional basis based on the forward prices for the estimated month of settlement and the Company&#8217;s estimated metal quantities based on assay data. The Company&#8217;s sales based on a provisional price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated for hedge accounting, is primarily marked to market through Sales each period prior to final settlement. The Company also adjusts estimated metal quantities used in computing provisional sales using new information and assay data from the smelter as it is received (if any). \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nA provisional payment is generally due upon delivery of the concentrate to the customer. Final payment is due upon final settlement of price and quantity with the customer. \n\nThe principal risks associated with recognition of sales on a provisional basis include metal price fluctuations and updated quantities between the date the sale is recorded and the date of final settlement. If a significant decline in metal prices occurs, or assay data results in a significant change in quantity between the provisional pricing date and the final settlement date, it is reasonably possible that the Company could be required to return a portion of the provisional payment received on the sale. Refer to Note 4 for additional information. \n\nIncome and Mining Taxes \n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of the Company&#8217;s liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. The Company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. The financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate. The Company determines if the assessment of a particular income tax effect is &#8220;complete.&#8221; Those effects for which the accounting is determined to be complete are reported in the enactment period financial statements. The Company has exposure to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tax positions in certain jurisdictions, such movements are recorded within Income and mining tax benefit (expense) related to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as non-current uncertain tax positions, while foreign exchange fluctuations impacting current tax positions are recorded within Other income (loss), net as foreign currency exchange gains (losses). With respect to the earnings that the Company derives from the operations of its consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of these consolidated companies. \n\nMining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes. As such, taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. \n\nNewmont&#8217;s operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. Newmont and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether it is more likely than not, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company&#8217;s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company&#8217;s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income and mining tax benefit (expense) . In certain jurisdictions, Newmont must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if Newmont believes the amount is collectible. \n\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets \n\nThe Company&#8217;s deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. The Company reviews the likelihood that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence. \n\nCertain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. The Company looks to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date, recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; Earnings history; \n\n&#8226; Projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices; \n\n&#8226; The duration of statutory carry forward periods; \n\n&#8226; Prudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference; \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\n&#8226; Nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and \n\n&#8226; The sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors. \n\nConcluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company utilizes a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of its cumulative results in recent years. However, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. The Company also considers all other available positive and negative evidence in its analysis. \n\nReclamation and Remediation Costs \n\nReclamation obligations associated with operating and non-operating mine sites are recognized when an obligation is incurred and the fair value can be reasonably estimated. Fair value is measured as the present value of expected cash flow estimates, after considering inflation, our credit-adjusted risk-free rates and a market risk premium appropriate for our operations. The liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset&#8217;s carrying value and amortized over the life of the related asset. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Changes in reclamation estimates at mines that are not currently operating, as the mine or portion of the mine site has entered the closure phase and has no substantive future economic value, are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. The estimated reclamation obligation is based on when spending for an existing disturbance is expected to occur. Costs included in estimated asset retirement obligations are discounted to their present value as cash flows are readily estimable over a period of up to fifty years. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the reclamation obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for asset retirement obligations. \n\nRemediation costs are accrued when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in remediation estimates at non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value as cash flows are readily estimable over a period up to fifty years. \n\nForeign Currency \n\nThe functional currency for the majority of the Company&#8217;s operations is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured at current exchange rates and the resulting adjustments are included in Other income (loss), net . The financial statements of our foreign entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars with the resulting adjustments charged or credited directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in total equity. All assets and liabilities are translated into the U.S. dollar using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. The gains or losses on foreign currency rates on cash holdings in foreign currencies are included in Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of the grant and expenses the awards in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the requisite employee service period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of RSUs are based on the Newmont stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Stock-based compensation expense related to all awards, including awards with a market or performance condition that cliff vest, is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period of the award on a straight-line basis. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. The Company's estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee retirement eligibility dates, the Company's performance and related tax impacts. \n\nNet Income (Loss) per Common Share \n\nBasic and diluted income per share are presented for Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders . Basic income per common share is computed by dividing income available to Newmont common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per common share is computed similarly except that weighted average common shares is increased to reflect all dilutive instruments, including employee stock awards. Dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding if their effect would be anti-dilutive based on the treasury stock method or due to a net loss from continuing operations. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nThe Company reports the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if a disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results when the business is classified as held for \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nsale, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment and ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations. Under ASC 360, assets may be classified as held for sale even though discontinued operations classification is not met. Equity method investments, which are specifically scoped out of ASC 360, can only be classified as held for sale if discontinued operations classification is also achieved. The results of discontinued operations are reported in Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for current and prior periods, including any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell. \n\nComprehensive Income (Loss) \n\nIn addition to Net income (loss) , Comprehensive income (loss) includes all changes in equity during a period, such as adjustments to minimum pension liabilities, foreign currency translation adjustments, changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and cumulative unrecognized changes in fair value of marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale, except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. \n\nCare and Maintenance \n\nThe Company incurs certain direct operating costs and depreciation and amortization costs when operations are temporarily halted and placed in care and maintenance. Direct operating costs incurred while operations are temporarily placed in care and maintenance are included in Other expense, net as these costs do not benefit the productive process and are not related to sales. Depreciation and amortization costs incurred while operations are temporarily placed in care and maintenance are included in Depreciation and amortization . \n\nReclassifications \n\nCertain amounts and disclosures in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2022 presentation. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Securities and Exchange Commission Rules \n\nFinancial Disclosures of Government Assistance \n\nIn November 2021, ASU No. 2021-10 was issued which provides guidance for required annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2022. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Securities and Exchange Commission Rules \n\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform \n\nIn March 2020, ASU No. 2020-04 was issued which provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden on accounting for contract modifications caused by reference rate reform. In January 2021, ASU No. 2021-01 was issued which broadened the scope of ASU No. 2020-04 to include certain derivative instruments. In December 2022, ASU No. 2022-06 was issued which deferred the sunset date of ASU No. 2020-04. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The guidance may be adopted over time as reference rate reform activities occur and should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is in the process of reviewing key contracts to identify any contracts that reference LIBOR and to implement adequate fallback provisions if not already implemented to mitigate the risks or impacts from the transition. No material impacts are expected to the consolidated financial statements or disclosures. \n\nInflation Reduction Act \n\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \"IRA\") into law. The IRA introduced an excise tax on stock repurchases of 1% of the fair market value of stock repurchases net of stock issued during the tax year and a corporate alternative minimum tax (the \"Corporate AMT\") of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (\"AFSI\") of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1 billion over a three-year period. The excise tax on stock repurchases is effective on net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022 and the Corporate AMT is effective for tax periods beginning in fiscal year 2023. While waiting on pending Department of Treasury regulatory guidance, the Company is continuing to monitor developments. Based upon information known to date, no material impacts are expected to the Consolidated Financial Statements, disclosures, or cash flows. \n\nNOTE 3 SEGMENT INFORMATION \n\nThe Company regularly reviews its segment reporting for alignment with its strategic goals and operational structure as well as for evaluation of business performance and allocation of resources by Newmont&#8217;s Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") and has determined that its operations are organized into five geographic regions: North America, South America, Australia, Africa and Nevada, which also represent Newmont&#8217;s reportable and operating segments. \n\nThe Company's Nevada segment consists of its 38.5 % interest in NGM which is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, which is an exception available to entities in the extractive industries, thereby recognizing its pro-rata share of \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nthe assets, liabilities and operations of NGM. The Company&#8217;s investment in the Pueblo Viejo mine is included in the South America reportable segment within Other South America. All other equity method investments are included in Corporate and Other. \n\nNotwithstanding the reportable segments structure, the Company internally reports information on a mine-by-mine basis for each mining operation and has chosen to disclose this information in the following tables. Income (loss) before income and mining tax and other items from reportable segments does not reflect general corporate expenses, interest (except project-specific interest) or income and mining taxes. Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment in order to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment performance. Newmont&#8217;s business activities that are not included within the reportable segments are included in Corporate and Other. Although they are not required to be included in this footnote, they are provided for reconciliation purposes. \n\nPotential change to reportable segments. In January 2023, Newmont launched certain initiatives to reassess accountabilities of the senior leadership team and the Company's operating strategies for its operations in light of the continuing adverse market conditions, which include the impacts of the war in Ukraine and COVID-19 pandemic on labor markets, global supply chains, higher input costs, and record inflation rates. Given the focus on these initiatives, a potential change to the Company&#8217;s reportable segments is currently being evaluated. The Company expects to complete its analysis in 2023. \n\nThe financial information relating to the Company&#8217;s segments is as follows: \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\n##TABLE_START Sales Costs Applicable to Sales Depreciation and Amortization Advanced Projects, Research and Development and Exploration Income (Loss) before Income and Mining Tax and Other Items Total Assets Capital Expenditures (1) \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 CC&#38;V $ 333 &#160; $ 241 &#160; $ 71 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ ( 527 ) $ 286 &#160; $ 44 &#160; Musselwhite 305 &#160; 195 &#160; 79 &#160; 8 &#160; 23 &#160; 1,294 &#160; 54 &#160; Porcupine 504 &#160; 281 &#160; 104 &#160; 14 &#160; ( 329 ) 1,401 &#160; 152 &#160; &#201;l&#233;onore 391 &#160; 266 &#160; 115 &#160; 5 &#160; 4 &#160; 1,010 &#160; 60 &#160; \n\nPe&#241;asquito: (2) \n\nGold 1,006 &#160; 442 &#160; 148 &#160; Silver 549 &#160; 454 &#160; 151 &#160; Lead 133 &#160; 94 &#160; 32 &#160; Zinc 501 &#160; 316 &#160; 96 &#160; Total Pe&#241;asquito 2,189 &#160; 1,306 &#160; 427 &#160; 19 &#160; 403 &#160; 6,430 &#160; 183 &#160; Other North America &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; 4 &#160; ( 41 ) 88 &#160; 4 &#160; North America \n\n3,722 &#160; 2,289 &#160; 804 &#160; 61 &#160; ( 467 ) 10,509 &#160; 497 &#160; Yanacocha 451 &#160; 313 &#160; 95 &#160; 22 &#160; ( 612 ) 2,225 &#160; 439 &#160; Merian 723 &#160; 369 &#160; 80 &#160; 21 &#160; 249 &#160; 923 &#160; 56 &#160; Cerro Negro 508 &#160; 283 &#160; 148 &#160; 25 &#160; ( 451 ) 1,659 &#160; 132 &#160; Other South America &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; 40 &#160; ( 68 ) 2,416 &#160; 3 &#160; South America \n\n1,682 &#160; 965 &#160; 327 &#160; 108 &#160; ( 882 ) 7,223 &#160; 630 &#160; Boddington: Gold 1,447 &#160; 652 &#160; 118 &#160; Copper 316 &#160; 181 &#160; 34 &#160; Total Boddington 1,763 &#160; 833 &#160; 152 &#160; 7 &#160; 779 &#160; 2,264 &#160; 72 &#160; Tanami 878 &#160; 328 &#160; 101 &#160; 28 &#160; 422 &#160; 1,585 &#160; 343 &#160; Other Australia &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 18 &#160; ( 27 ) 51 &#160; 10 &#160; Australia 2,641 &#160; 1,161 &#160; 258 &#160; 53 &#160; 1,174 &#160; 3,900 &#160; 425 &#160; Ahafo 1,023 &#160; 566 &#160; 167 &#160; 26 &#160; 267 &#160; 2,619 &#160; 268 &#160; Akyem 749 &#160; 334 &#160; 141 &#160; 14 &#160; 257 &#160; 998 &#160; 34 &#160; Other Africa &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; ( 13 ) 6 &#160; 4 &#160; Africa 1,772 &#160; 900 &#160; 308 &#160; 43 &#160; 511 &#160; 3,623 &#160; 306 &#160; NGM 2,098 &#160; 1,153 &#160; 471 &#160; 32 &#160; 434 &#160; 7,419 &#160; 308 &#160; Nevada \n\n2,098 &#160; 1,153 &#160; 471 &#160; 32 &#160; 434 &#160; 7,419 &#160; 308 &#160; Corporate and Other &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; 163 &#160; ( 821 ) 5,808 &#160; 24 &#160; Consolidated $ 11,915 &#160; $ 6,468 &#160; $ 2,185 &#160; $ 460 &#160; $ ( 51 ) $ 38,482 &#160; $ 2,190 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Includes an increase in accrued capital expenditures of $ 59 .

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the value of the liability included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $ 908 and $ 981 , respectively. \n\nRevenue by Geographic Area \n\nNewmont primarily conducts metal sales in U.S. dollars, and therefore Sales are not exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Revenues from sales attributed to countries based on the customer&#8217;s location were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 United Kingdom $ 8,309 &#160; $ 8,404 &#160; $ 8,489 &#160; South Korea 1,426 &#160; 1,665 &#160; 1,317 &#160; Mexico 604 &#160; 642 &#160; 277 &#160; Japan 442 &#160; 386 &#160; 244 &#160; Philippines 340 &#160; 264 &#160; 242 &#160; Germany 308 &#160; 282 &#160; 277 &#160; United States 24 &#160; 62 &#160; 97 &#160; Switzerland &#8212; &#160; 275 &#160; 243 &#160; \n\nOther (1) \n\n462 &#160; 242 &#160; 311 &#160; $ 11,915 &#160; $ 12,222 &#160; $ 11,497 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Includes $ 73 , $ 79 , and $ 67 related to non-cash amortization of the silver streaming agreement liability for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nRevenue by Major Customer \n\nAs gold can be sold through numerous gold market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product. In 2022, sales to Standard Chartered were $ 4,179 ( 35 %) and JPMorgan Chase were $ 1,503 ( 13 %) of total gold sales. In 2021, sales to Standard Chartered were $ 4,634 ( 38 %) and JPMorgan Chase were $ 2,002 ( 17 %) of total gold sales. In 2020 sales to JPMorgan Chase were $ 2,775 ( 24 %) and Standard Chartered were $ 2,737 ( 24 %) of total gold sales. \n\nThe Company sells silver, lead, zinc and copper predominantly in the form of concentrates which are sold directly to smelters located in Asia, North America, and Europe. The concentrates are sold under a combination of short-term and long-term supply contracts with processing fees based on the demand for these concentrates in the global marketplace. \n\nNOTE 5 RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION \n\nThe Company&#8217;s mining and exploration activities are subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects t o make in the future, \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nexpenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation and remediation costs are based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Reclamation and remediation expense consisted of: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Reclamation adjustments and other $ 646 &#160; $ 1,633 &#160; $ 180 &#160; Reclamation accretion 173 &#160; 125 &#160; 134 &#160; Reclamation expense 819 &#160; 1,758 &#160; 314 &#160; Remediation adjustments and other 96 &#160; 82 &#160; 46 &#160; Remediation accretion 6 &#160; 6 &#160; 6 &#160; Remediation expense 102 &#160; 88 &#160; 52 &#160; Reclamation and remediation $ 921 &#160; $ 1,846 &#160; $ 366 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2022, reclamation adjustments were primarily due to higher estimated closure costs resulting from cost inflation and increased water management costs at portions of the Yanacocha and Porcupine site operations that are no longer in production and with no expected substantive future economic value (i.e., non-operating) that resulted in increases of $ 529 and $ 91 , respectively. In 2021, reclamation adjustments were primarily comprised of $ 1,554 related to non-operating portions of the Yanacocha site. In 2020, reclamation adjustments primarily related to increased lime consumption and water treatment costs at non-operating Yanacocha sites and an update to the project cost estimates at non-operating Porcupine sites that resulted in increases of $ 152 and $ 16 , respectively. \n\nIn 2022, remediation adjustments are primarily due to higher waste disposal costs and project execution delays at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites. In 2021, remediation adjustments are primarily due to revisions to estimated construction costs of the water treatment plant at the Midnite mine and higher estimated closure cost arising from recent tailings management review and monitoring requirements set forth by GISTM. In 2020, remediation adjustments primarily related to project execution delays due to COVID-19 and updated project cost estimates at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites of $ 27 and other remediation project spend at other sites. \n\nThe following are reconciliations of Reclamation and remediation liabilities : \n\n##TABLE_START Reclamation Remediation Total \n\nBalance at January 1, 2021 \n\n$ 3,719 &#160; $ 313 &#160; $ 4,032 &#160; Additions, changes in estimates and other 2,045 &#160; 67 &#160; 2,112 &#160; Acquisitions and divestitures ( 3 ) 1 &#160; ( 2 ) Payments, net ( 118 ) ( 43 ) ( 161 ) Accretion expense 125 &#160; 6 &#160; 131 &#160; \n\nBalance at December 31, 2021 \n\n5,768 &#160; 344 &#160; 6,112 &#160; Additions, changes in estimates and other 981 &#160; 79 &#160; 1,060 &#160; Payments, net ( 191 ) ( 56 ) ( 247 ) Accretion expense 173 &#160; 6 &#160; 179 &#160; \n\nBalance at December 31, 2022 \n\n$ 6,731 &#160; $ 373 &#160; $ 7,104 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START At December 31, 2022 2021 Reclamation Remediation Total Reclamation Remediation Total \n\nCurrent (1) \n\n$ 482 &#160; $ 44 &#160; $ 526 &#160; $ 213 &#160; $ 60 &#160; $ 273 &#160; \n\nNon-current (2) \n\n6,249 &#160; 329 &#160; 6,578 &#160; 5,555 &#160; 284 &#160; 5,839 &#160; Total (3) \n\n$ 6,731 &#160; $ 373 &#160; $ 7,104 &#160; $ 5,768 &#160; $ 344 &#160; $ 6,112 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) The current portion of reclamation and remediation liabilities are included in Other current liabilities . Refer to Note 22. \n\n(2) The non-current portion of reclamation and remediation liabilities are included in Reclamation and remediation liabilities. \n\n(3) Total reclamation liabilities includes $ 3,722 and $ 3,250 related to Yanacocha at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Company is also involved in several matters concerning environmental remediation obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 34 % greater or &#8212; % lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2022. The \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\namounts accrued are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are included in Other current liabilities and Reclamation and remediation liabilities in the period estimates are revised. \n\nIncluded in Other non-current assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are $ 62 and $ 49 respectively, of non-current restricted cash held for purposes of settling reclamation and remediation obligations. The amounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily relate to the Ahafo and Akyem mines in Ghana, Africa. \n\nIncluded in Other non-current assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 35 and $ 51 , respectively, of non-current restricted investments, which are legally pledged for purposes of settling reclamation and remediation obligations. The amounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily relate to the San Jose Reservoir in Peru, South America. \n\nRefer to Note 25 for further discussion of reclamation and remediation matters. \n\nNOTE 6 IMPAIRMENT CHARGES \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Long-lived and other assets (1) \n\nGoodwill Total Long-lived and other assets (1) \n\nTotal Long-lived and other assets (1) \n\nTotal \n\nNorth America (2) \n\n$ 515 &#160; $ 341 &#160; $ 856 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 25 &#160; \n\nSouth America (3) \n\n1 &#160; 459 &#160; 460 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; Australia 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Africa 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 7 &#160; 7 &#160; Nevada 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; 8 &#160; Corporate and Other &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; 9 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; $ 520 &#160; $ 800 &#160; $ 1,320 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 49 &#160; $ 49 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Primarily relates to non-cash write-downs of various assets that are no longer in use, except for certain impairment charges described below. \n\n(2) Primarily consists of impairment charges related to Property, plant and mine development, net at CC&#38;V and Goodwill at Porcupine for the year ended December 31, 2022. See below for further information. \n\n(3) Primarily consists of impairment charges related to Goodwill at Cerro Negro for the year ended December 31, 2022. See below for further information. \n\nThe estimated cash flows utilized in both the long-lived asset and goodwill impairment evaluations are derived from the Company's current business plans. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company completed its annual business plan update which reflected certain adverse changes in market conditions, including inflationary pressures to costs and capital, strategic evaluation regarding the use of capital, and updates to asset retirement costs. \n\nImpairment of long-lived and other assets \n\nThe Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company determined that an impairment indicator existed at CC&#38;V, in the North America segment. This determination was based on the updated business plan, which reflected a deterioration in underlying cash flows from lower production, impacted by the decision to place the mill on long-term care and maintenance, higher costs due to inflationary pressures, as well as an increase to the asset retirement cost . As a result of the impairment indicator, a recoverability test was performed and the Company concluded the long-lived assets at CC&#38;V were impaired resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $ 511 and a remaining balance of $ 25 within Property, plant and mine development, net at December 31, 2022. \n\nThe Company measured the impairment by comparing the total fair value of the existing operations to the carrying value of the corresponding assets. The estimated fair value was determined using the income approach and is considered a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs to the fair value measurement included (i) updated cash flow information from the Company's current business and closure plans, (ii) a short-term gold price of $ 1,750 , (iii) a long-term gold price of $ 1,600 , (iv) current estimates of reserves, resources, and exploration potential, and (v) a country specific pre-tax discount rate of 6.75 %. \n\nImpairment of goodwill \n\nThe Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually at December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. At December 31, 2022, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill test for all the reporting units in the North America and South America segments. Based on these tests, the Company concluded that Goodwill was impaired at the Porcupine reporting unit, in the North America segment, and the Cerro Negro reporting unit, in the South America \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nsegment. The Porcupine goodwill impairment was driven by a deterioration in underlying cash flows from higher costs due to inflationary pressures and higher capital costs related to safety enhancements and the expansion of the active tailings storage facility, ensuring GISTM compliance, as well as an increase to the asset retirement cost, and resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $ 341 , which represented the full goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to impairment. The Cerro Negro goodwill impairment was driven by a 14 % country specific discount rate that reflects current macroeconomic risk and uncertainty in Argentina, and resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $ 459 , which represented the full goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to impairment. The long-lived assets of Porcupine and Cerro Negro were evaluated for impairment prior to the quantitative goodwill test and no impairment was identified. \n\nThe Company measured the impairments by comparing the total fair value of the existing operations to the corresponding reporting unit carrying value. The estimated fair value was determined using the income approach and is considered a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs to the fair value measured included (i) updated cash flow information from the Company's current business and closure plans, (ii) a short-term gold price of $ 1,750 , (iii) a long-term gold price of $ 1,600 , (iv) current estimates of reserves, resources, and exploration potential, and (v) a country specific discount rate of 4.50 % in Canada and 14 % in Argentina. \n\nNOTE 7 OTHER EXPENSE, NET \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 COVID-19 specific costs $ 38 &#160; $ 87 &#160; $ 92 &#160; Settlement costs 22 &#160; 11 &#160; 58 &#160; Restructuring and severance 4 &#160; 11 &#160; 18 &#160; \n\nCare and maintenance costs (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; 178 &#160; Goldcorp transaction and integration costs &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 23 &#160; Other 18 &#160; 26 &#160; 15 &#160; Other expense, net $ 82 &#160; $ 143 &#160; $ 384 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) The Company recognized additional non-cash care and maintenance costs included in Depreciation and amortization of $ 3 at Tanami for the year ended December 31, 2021.

These deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other metals produced by the Company. \n\nThe Company operates in various jurisdictions around the world that have statutory tax rates that are significantly different than those of the U.S. These differences combine to move the overall effective tax rate higher than the U.S. statutory rate. \n\nMining taxes in Nevada, Mexico, Canada, Peru and Australia represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. \n\nIn the U.S., capital losses may be carried forward five years to offset capital gains. Capital loss carryforwards of $ &#8212; , $ 152 , and $ &#8212; , expired in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company carries a full valuation allowance on U.S. capital losses. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nComponents of the Company's deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31, 2022 2021 Deferred income tax assets: Property, plant and mine development $ 887 &#160; $ 928 &#160; Inventory 94 &#160; 87 &#160; Reclamation and remediation 1,702 &#160; 1,500 &#160; Net operating losses, capital losses and tax credits 1,978 &#160; 1,908 &#160; Investment in partnerships and subsidiaries &#8212; &#160; 26 &#160; Employee-related benefits 75 &#160; 146 &#160; Derivative instruments and unrealized loss on investments 54 &#160; 74 &#160; Foreign Exchange and Financing Obligations 67 &#160; 62 &#160; Silver Streaming Agreement 246 &#160; 311 &#160; Other 202 &#160; 124 &#160; 5,305 &#160; 5,166 &#160; Valuation allowances ( 3,994 ) ( 3,791 ) $ 1,311 &#160; $ 1,375 &#160; Deferred income tax liabilities: Property, plant and mine development $ ( 2,176 ) $ ( 2,409 ) Inventory ( 62 ) ( 58 ) Investment in partnerships and subsidiaries ( 615 ) ( 730 ) Other ( 94 ) ( 53 ) ( 2,947 ) ( 3,250 ) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ ( 1,636 ) $ ( 1,875 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThese amounts reflect the classification and presentation that is reported for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company operates. \n\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets \n\nThe Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, a new valuation allowance has been recorded in Argentina. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present or if additional weight were given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company recorded an increase to the valuation allowance of $ 261 to tax expense, primarily driven by an addition in the U.S. relating to capital loss utilization, an increase in the Yanacocha reclamation obligation in Peru, and a new valuation allowance established in Argentina. This was partially offset by a release for expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards. There were additional valuation allowance decreases related to other components of the financial statements of $ 58 . \n\nRefer to Note 2 for additional risk factors that could impact the Company&#8217;s ability to realize the deferred tax assets. \n\nTax Loss Carryforwards, Foreign Tax Credits, and Canadian Tax Credits \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had (i) $ 1,963 and $ 2,020 of net operating loss carry forwards, respectively; and (ii) $ 615 and $ 669 of tax credit carry forwards, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 649 and $ 586 , respectively, of net operating loss carry forwards are attributable to the U.S., Australia and France for which current tax law provides no expiration period. The net operating loss carry forward in Canada of $ 888 will expire by 2042. The net operating loss carryforward in Mexico of $ 160 will expire in 2032. The net operating loss carry forward in other countries is $ 266 . \n\nTax credit carry forwards for 2022 and 2021 of $ 463 and $ 510 , respectively, consist of foreign tax credits available in the United States; substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the end of 2029. Canadian tax credits for 2022 and 2021 of $ 152 and $ 159 , respectively, consist of investment tax credits and minimum mining tax credits. Canadian investment tax credits of $ 78 will substantially expire by 2036, mining tax credits of $ 9 will expire by 2042, and the other Canadian tax credits of $ 64 do not expire. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nCompany&#8217;s Unrecognized Tax Benefits \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 245 &#160; $ 237 &#160; $ 326 &#160; Additions (reductions) for tax positions of prior years ( 1 ) 36 &#160; ( 33 ) Additions for tax positions of current year &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities ( 53 ) ( 26 ) ( 58 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 190 &#160; $ 245 &#160; $ 237 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, $ 219 , $ 335 and $ 369 , respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties that, if recognized, would impact the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate. \n\nThe Company operates in numerous countries around the world and is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company&#8217;s business conducted within the country involved. \n\nThe Australian Taxation Office (&#8220;ATO&#8221;) is conducting a limited review of the Company&#8217;s prior year tax returns. The ATO is reviewing an internal reorganization executed in 2011 when Newmont completed a restructure of the shareholding in the Company&#8217;s Australian subsidiaries. To date, the Company has responded to inquiries from the ATO and provided them with supporting documentation for the transaction and the Company&#8217;s associated tax positions. One aspect of the ATO review relates to an Australian capital gains tax that applies to sales or transfers of stock in certain types of entities. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the ATO notified the Company that it believes the 2011 reorganization is subject to capital gains tax of approximately $ 85 (including interest and penalties). The Company disputes this conclusion and intends to vigorously defend its position that the transaction is not subject to this tax. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made a $ 24 payment to the ATO and lodged an Appeal with the Australian Federal Court to preserve its right to contest the ATO conclusions on this matter. The Company and the ATO continue to provide support to the Court for their respective positions and during the fourth quarter of 2022 the Court agreed that the Company has until 30 June 2023 to submit its final evidence. A provisional Court date has been set for the third quarter of 2024. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Administraci&#243;n Federal de Ingresos P&#250;blicos (\"AFIP\") in Argentina notified the Company that it completed the 2016 transfer pricing review. The AFIP has questioned the Company&#8217;s treatment of intercompany loans and believes they should be akin to capital contributions. These intercompany loans are still in place. The Company disputes this position and continues to believe that the financing meets the qualifications of bona fide debt and intends to vigorously defend this position. To date, no final audit report or assessment has been provided by the AFIP. The matter will be closely monitored and evaluated as more information becomes available. \n\nThe Company and/or subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016. As a result of (i) statute of limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its unrecognized income tax liability will decrease between $ 60 and $ 100 in the next 12 months. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of Income and mining tax benefit (expense) . At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $ 77 and $ 138 , respectively. During 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company released $ 61 , $ 8 and $ 20 of interest and penalties, respectively, through the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nOther \n\nNo additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nNOTE 11 EMPLOYEE-RELATED BENEFITS \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31, 2022 2021 Current: Accrued payroll and withholding taxes $ 310 &#160; $ 339 &#160; Workers&#8217; participation and other bonuses 56 &#160; 18 &#160; Other post-retirement benefit plans 6 &#160; 6 &#160; Accrued severance 4 &#160; 2 &#160; Employee pension benefits 3 &#160; 4 &#160; Other employee-related payables 20 &#160; 17 &#160; $ 399 &#160; $ 386 &#160; Non-current: Accrued severance $ 208 &#160; $ 278 &#160; Other post-retirement benefit plans 60 &#160; 78 &#160; Employee pension benefits 38 &#160; 45 &#160; Other employee-related payables 36 &#160; 38 &#160; $ 342 &#160; $ 439 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nPension and Other Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company provides a defined benefit pension plan to eligible employees.

The Company&#8217;s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. The information contained in the above tables presents the combined funded status of qualified and non-qualified plans. The Company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market conditions and the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate in calendar year 2023. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, all pension benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets with the exception of one defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. and one defined benefit pension plan in Canada. The fair value of the plan assets associated with these pension benefit plans was in excess of the related accumulated benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2021, all pension benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets with the exception of one defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. and one defined benefit pension plan in Canada. The following table provides information for the Company's defined benefit pensions plans that had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits (1) \n\n2022 2021 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 37 &#160; $ 43 &#160; Projected benefit obligation $ 42 &#160; $ 50 &#160; Fair value of plan assets $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; ##TABLE_END ____________________________ \n\n(1) Information for other benefit plans with an accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets has not been included as all of the other benefit plans are unfunded. \n\nThe significant assumptions used in measuring the Company&#8217;s benefit obligation were mortality assumptions and discount rate. \n\nThe mortality assumptions used to measure the pension and other post retirement obligation incorporate future mortality improvements from tables published by the Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\"). The Company utilized the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2021 generational projection scale to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of December 31, 2021. In 2022, the SOA announced they would not release a new generational projection scale and instead updated the Mortality Improvement Model (\"MIM\") tool with the ability to optionally input mortality loads to model differing viewpoints of the ongoing effect of COVID. The Company utilized the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2021 generational projection scales, with no adjustment for COVID due to the Company not experiencing material mortality gain due to COVID, to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of December 31, 2022. \n\nYield curves matching the Company&#8217;s benefit obligations were derived using a model based on high quality corporate bond data from Bloomberg. The model develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose projected cash flows match the projected benefit payments of the plan. The resulting curves were used to identify a weighted average discount rate for the Company of 5.63 % and 3.06 % at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments. \n\nActuarial gains of $ 197 and $ 38 were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily due to an increase in discount rate from the prior year. \n\nSettlement accounting is required when annual lump sum payments exceed the annual interest and service costs for a plan and results in a remeasurement of the related pension benefit obligation and plan assets and the recognition of settlement charges in Other income (loss), net due to the acceleration of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses. Lump sum payments are primarily made from the plan assets. Settlement accounting was triggered for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 resulting in pension settlement charges of $ 137 , $ 4 and $ 92 , respectively. \n\nFor the period ended December 31, 2022, pension settlement charges primarily resulted from the Company executing an annuitization to transfer a portion of the pension plan obligations from the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans to an insurance company using plan assets during the first quarter of 2022. As a result, $ 527 of the previously recognized pension obligations were transferred and settlement accounting was triggered which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash settlement loss of $ 130 in Other income (loss), net. In December 2022, the Company received the final true-up from the insurance company for the annuitization, which had an inconsequential impact on the settlement. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nThe following table provides the net pension and other benefits amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) : \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits Other Benefits At December 31, At December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): Net actuarial gain (loss) $ ( 76 ) $ ( 240 ) $ 29 &#160; $ 11 &#160; Prior service credit 12 &#160; 17 &#160; 1 &#160; 2 &#160; ( 64 ) ( 223 ) 30 &#160; 13 &#160; Less: Income taxes 13 &#160; 46 &#160; ( 6 ) ( 2 ) Total $ ( 51 ) $ ( 177 ) $ 24 &#160; $ 11 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table provides components of the total benefit cost (income), inclusive of the net periodic pension and other benefits costs (credits): \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefit Costs (Credits) Other Benefit Costs (Credits) Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 \n\nPension benefit cost (income), net: (1) \n\nService cost $ 15 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; Interest cost 19 &#160; 30 &#160; 36 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 35 ) ( 59 ) ( 61 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Amortization, net 2 &#160; 29 &#160; 29 &#160; ( 3 ) ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Net periodic benefit cost (income) $ 1 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 3 &#160; Settlement cost 137 &#160; 4 &#160; 92 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total benefit cost (income) $ 138 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 113 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Service costs are included in Costs applicable to sales or General and administrative and the other components of benefit costs are included in Other income (loss) , net . \n\nThe following table provides the components recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) : \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits Other Benefits Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Net loss (gain) $ ( 20 ) $ ( 48 ) $ 60 &#160; $ ( 20 ) $ ( 5 ) $ 4 &#160; Amortization, net ( 2 ) ( 29 ) ( 29 ) 3 &#160; 2 &#160; 1 &#160; Settlements ( 137 ) ( 4 ) ( 92 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) $ ( 159 ) $ ( 81 ) $ ( 61 ) $ ( 17 ) $ ( 3 ) $ 5 &#160; Total benefit cost (credit) and other comprehensive income (loss) $ ( 21 ) $ ( 62 ) $ 52 &#160; $ ( 16 ) $ ( 1 ) $ 8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nActuarial losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining future service period of the current active participants. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nThe significant assumptions used in measuring the Company&#8217;s Total benefit cost (income) and other comprehensive income (loss) were discount rate and expected return on plan assets: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits Other Benefits Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Weighted average assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate (1) \n\n4.09 &#160; % 2.77 &#160; % 3.49 &#160; % 3.03 &#160; % 2.70 &#160; % 3.49 &#160; % Expected return on plan assets 6.75 &#160; % 6.75 &#160; % 6.75 &#160; % N/A N/A N/A ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Total benefit cost (income) and other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was remeasured due to the settlement accounting required from the retiree annuity purchase on March 25, 2022. The discount rate used for determining the Total benefit cost (income) and other comprehensive income (loss) reflected 3.03 % from January 1, 2022 through March 25, 2022 and 4.09 % from March 26, 2022 through December 31, 2022. \n\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets used for each period in the three years ended December 31, 2022 was determined based on an analysis of the asset returns over multiple time horizons for the Company&#8217;s actual plan and for other comparable U.S. corporations. At December 31, 2022, Newmont has estimated the expected long-term return on plan assets to be 6.50 % which will be used in determining future net periodic benefit cost. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by considering the most recent capital market forecasts, the plans&#8217; current asset allocation and the actual return on plan assets in comparison to the expected return on assets. The average actual return on plan assets during the 34 years ended December 31, 2022 approximated 7.54 %. \n\nNewmont has two pension calculations for salaried U.S. employees. The first is a &#8220;Final Average Pay&#8221; pension calculation which pays a monthly amount to employees in retirement based, in part, on their highest five year eligible earnings and years of credited service. The second is the &#8220;Stable Value&#8221; calculation which is defined as a lump sum payment to employees upon retirement. The amount of the lump sum is the total of annual accruals based on the employee&#8217;s eligible earnings and years of service. The benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula were frozen on June 30, 2014 for those eligible employees. Beginning July 1, 2014, all future accruals are based on the terms and features of the Stable Value calculation. \n\nThe pension plans employ an independent investment firm which invests the assets of the plans in certain approved funds that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target allocations. The goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable risk levels. The investment performance of the plans and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. The performance of the pension funds are monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the Company&#8217;s management, which is advised by an independent investment consultant. With the exception of global capital market economic risks, the Company has identified no significant portfolio risks associated to asset classes. The following is a summary of the target asset allocations for 2022 and the actual asset allocation at December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Asset Allocation Target Actual at December 31, \n\nU.S. equity investments 11 &#160; % 10 &#160; % International equity investments 12 &#160; % 12 &#160; % World equity fund (U.S. and International equity investments) 20 &#160; % 19 &#160; % High yield fixed income investments 4 &#160; % 4 &#160; % Fixed income investments 45 &#160; % 44 &#160; % Cash equivalents &#8212; &#160; % 1 &#160; % Other 8 &#160; % 10 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nThe following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s pension plan assets measured at fair value: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value at December 31, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3 &#160; $ 4 &#160; Commingled funds 308 &#160; 1,010 &#160; Total $ 311 &#160; $ 1,014 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCash and cash equivalent instruments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets, which are primarily invested in money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nThe pension plans&#8217; commingled fund investments are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the net asset value per share for each fund. Although the majority of the underlying assets in the funds consist of actively traded equity securities and bonds, the unit of account is considered to be at the fund level. These funds require less than a month&#8217;s notice for redemptions and can be redeemed at the net asset value per share. \n\nThe assumed health care trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits is 6.50 % in 2023 and decreases gradually each year to 5.00 % in 2029, which is used thereafter. \n\nCash Flows \n\nBenefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Plan Other Benefits Plan 2023 $ 17 &#160; $ 6 &#160; 2024 $ 18 &#160; $ 6 &#160; 2025 $ 18 &#160; $ 6 &#160; 2026 $ 21 &#160; $ 6 &#160; 2027 $ 22 &#160; $ 6 &#160; 2028 through 2032 $ 125 &#160; $ 27 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSavings Plans \n\nThe Company has one qualified defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. that covers salaried and hourly employees. When an employee meets eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100 % of employee contributions of up to 6 % of eligible earnings. Hourly employees receive an additional retirement contribution to the participant&#8217;s retirement contribution account equal to an amount which is paid and determined by the Company. Currently, the additional retirement contribution is 5 % of eligible earnings. Matching contributions are made in cash. In addition, the Company has one non-qualified supplemental savings plan for executive-level employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations. \n\nNOTE 12 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nThe Company has stock incentive plans for directors, executives and eligible employees. Stock incentive awards include RSUs and PSUs. The Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and vesting under all of its stock incentive awards. Prior to 2012, the Company also granted options to purchase shares of stock with exercise prices not less than fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. At December 31, 2022, 22,721,107 shares were authorized for future stock incentive plan awards. \n\nRestricted Stock Units \n\nThe Company grants RSUs to directors, executives and eligible employees. Awards are determined as a target percentage of base salary and, for eligible employees, are subject to a personal performance factor. For all RSU grants issued prior to February 2018, RSU awards vest on a straight-line basis over periods of three years or more, unless the employee becomes retirement eligible prior to the vesting date. If an employee becomes retirement eligible and retires prior to the vesting date, the remaining awards vest on a pro rata basis at the retirement date. Starting with the February 2018 grant, if the employee becomes retirement eligible at any point during the vesting period, the entire award is considered earned after the later of the one year service period from the grant date or the retirement eligible date. Prior to vesting, holders of RSUs do not have the right to vote the underlying shares; however, directors, executives and eligible employees accrue dividend equivalents on their RSUs, which are paid at the time the RSUs vest. The accrued dividend equivalents are not paid if RSUs are forfeited. The RSUs are subject to forfeiture risk and other restrictions. Upon vesting, the employee is entitled to receive one share of the Company&#8217;s common stock for each restricted stock unit. \n\nPerformance Stock Units \n\nThe Company grants PSUs to eligible executives that vest after a three year performance period based on the Company's total shareholder return compared to the return of a peer group. The grant date fair value of the awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the required performance period. \n\nThe grant date fair value of the market conditions for each PSU granted in 2022, 2021 or 2020 was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model, which requires the input of the following subjective assumptions: \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate 1.61 % 0.22 % 1.21 % Volatility range 31.78 % - 81.77 % \n\n31.41 % - 76.72 % \n\n24.71 % - 43.91 % \n\nWeighted-average volatility 54.89 % 53.05 % 35.38 % Expected term (years) 3 3 3 Weighted-average fair market value $ 77.00 $ 65.41 $ 59.24 ##TABLE_END \n\nThe risk-free interest rates are based on a U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's stock as well as the stock of the peer group for the three-year performance period. \n\nGoldcorp Employee Stock Options \n\nIn connection with Newmont's acquisition of Goldcorp in 2019, the Company exchanged 3.6 million outstanding Goldcorp options for 1.2 million Newmont options with the right to exercise each Newmont option for one share of Newmont common stock. At December 31, 2021, there were 313,855 options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $ 56.61 . During 2022, 254,125 options were exercised with a weighted average exercise price of $ 58.25 . During 2022, 12,683 options expired with a weighted average exercise price of $ 61.97 . At December 31, 2022, there were 47,047 options outstanding and exercisable, at a weighted average exercise price of $ 46.33 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.2 years. \n\nStock-Based Compensation Activity \n\nA summary of the status and activity of non-vested RSUs and PSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START RSU PSU Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Non-vested at beginning of year 1,791,994 $ 51.06 &#160; 1,343,953 $ 55.91 &#160; Granted 1,061,330 $ 60.88 &#160; 772,062 $ 64.06 &#160; Vested ( 981,184 ) $ 47.76 &#160; ( 705,160 ) $ 42.34 &#160; Forfeited ( 172,404 ) $ 61.27 &#160; ( 209,099 ) $ 67.78 &#160; Non-vested at end of year 1,699,736 $ 58.07 &#160; 1,201,756 $ 67.05 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total intrinsic value and fair value of RSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 62 , $ 72 and $ 81 , respectively. The total intrinsic value and fair value of PSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 47 , $ 21 and $ 42 , respectively. \n\nCash flows resulting from excess tax benefits are classified as part of cash flows from operating activities. Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for vested RSUs, settled PSUs, and exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such equity awards. The Company recorded $ 5 , $ 3 and $ 1 in excess tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, there was $ 52 and $ 31 of unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested RSUs and PSUs, respectively. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2 years. \n\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Stock-based compensation: Restricted stock units $ 49 &#160; $ 47 &#160; $ 51 &#160; Performance leveraged stock units 24 &#160; 25 &#160; 21 &#160; Other (1) \n\n3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 12 &#160; Total $ 76 &#160; $ 72 &#160; $ 84 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2022, other includes the Company's proportionate share of NGM stock compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other includes Goldcorp phantom restricted share units and Goldcorp performance share units. These awards have a cash settlement provision. The Company recognizes the liability and expense for these awards ratably over the requisite service period giving effect to the adjusted fair value at the end of each reporting period. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nNOTE 13 FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING \n\nFair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: \n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; \n\nLevel 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and \n\nLevel 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity). \n\nThe following tables set forth the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring (at least annually) and nonrecurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value at December 31, 2022 \n\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents (1) \n\n$ 2,877 &#160; $ 2,877 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Restricted cash 67 &#160; 67 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Time deposits and other (Note 15) \n\n846 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 846 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Trade receivables from provisional concentrate sales, net 364 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 364 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long-lived assets (Note 6) \n\n25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 25 &#160; Marketable and other equity securities (Note 15) \n\n260 &#160; 250 &#160; 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restricted marketable debt securities (Note 15) \n\n27 &#160; 23 &#160; 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restricted other assets (Note 15) \n\n8 &#160; 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration assets (Note 14) \n\n188 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 188 &#160; Derivative assets (Note 14) \n\n20 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 20 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 4,682 &#160; $ 3,225 &#160; $ 1,244 &#160; $ 213 &#160; Liabilities: Debt (2) \n\n$ 5,136 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 5,136 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration liabilities (Note 14) \n\n3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; $ 5,139 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 5,136 &#160; $ 3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value at December 31, 2021 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents (1) \n\n$ 4,992 &#160; $ 4,992 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Restricted cash 101 &#160; 101 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Trade receivables from provisional concentrate sales, net 297 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 297 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Assets held for sale (Note 1) \n\n68 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 68 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Marketable and other equity securities (Note 15) (3) \n\n335 &#160; 318 &#160; 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restricted marketable debt securities (Note 15) \n\n35 &#160; 28 &#160; 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restricted other assets (Note 15) \n\n16 &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration assets (Note 14) \n\n171 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 171 &#160; $ 6,015 &#160; $ 5,455 &#160; $ 389 &#160; $ 171 &#160; Liabilities: Debt (2) \n\n$ 6,712 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6,712 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration liabilities (Note 14) \n\n5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Other 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 6,723 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6,718 &#160; $ 5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 include time deposits that have an original maturity of three months or less. \n\n(2) Debt is carried at amortized cost. The outstanding carrying value was $ 5,571 and $ 5,652 at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value measurement of debt was based on an independent third-party pricing source. \n\n(3) Excludes certain investments accounted for under the measurement alternative. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (which includes restricted cash and cash equivalents) are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities. \n\nThe Company's time deposits and other primarily consists of time deposits with an original maturity of more than three months but less than one year and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as they are carried at amortized cost. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s net trade receivables from provisional metal concentrate sales, which contain an embedded derivative and are subject to final pricing, are valued using quoted market prices based on forward curves for the particular metal. As the contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange, these receivables are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe Company's assets held for sale consist of the Conga mill assets to be sold under a binding agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2021. The assets are classified as non-recurring within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 1 for further information. \n\nThe Company's long-lived assets consist of long-lived assets at CC&#38;V, in the North America segment, that were subject to fair value measurement as a result of impairment tests performed for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company performed a non-recurring fair value measurement, classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, in connection with recoverability and impairment tests performed over long-lived assets and goodwill for all reporting units. Impairment charges related to goodwill were for the full goodwill balance at Porcupine, in the North America segment, and Cerro Negro, in the South America segment, resulting in no remaining balance at December 31, 2022. For further information regarding management&#8217;s assessment of these certain long-lived assets and goodwill reporting units, including the assumptions utilized in determining the fair value, refer to Note 6. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s marketable and other equity securities with readily determinable fair values are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the marketable equity securities are calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s marketable and other equity securities without readily determinable fair values consists of the Company&#8217;s ownership in warrants in publicly traded companies. Warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes model using quoted market prices in active markets of the underlying securities. As the warrants themselves are not traded on the exchange, these equity securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these warrants are included in the \"Time deposits and other\" and the \"Marketable and other equity securities\" line items in the tables presented above, respectively. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s restricted marketable debt securities are primarily U.S. government issued bonds and international bonds. The Company&#8217;s South American debt securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, using published market prices of actively traded securities. The Company&#8217;s North American debt securities are classified within Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 1 debt securities are valued using published market prices of actively traded securities and the Level 2 debt securities are valued using pricing models which are based on published market inputs for similar, actively traded securities. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nThe Company's restricted other assets are primarily money market securities with a term longer than three months which are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. As such, they are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe contingent consideration assets and liabilities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the discount rate will result in an inverse impact to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration assets and liabilities. For certain contingent consideration assets, a change in copper price will result in a corresponding impact to the estimated fair value. Refer to Note 14 for further information. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s derivative instruments consist of fixed forward contracts. These derivative instruments are valued using pricing models. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, forward curves, measures of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. The Company&#8217;s derivatives trade in liquid markets, and as such, model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe following tables set forth a summary of the quantitative and qualitative information related to the significant observable and unobservable inputs used in the calculation of the Company&#8217;s Level 3 financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Description At December 31, 2022 Valuation technique Significant input Range, point estimate or average Long-lived assets $ 25 &#160; Income approach \n\nVarious (1) \n\nVarious (1) \n\nContingent consideration assets $ 188 &#160; \n\nMonte Carlo (2) \n\nDiscount rate (3) \n\n8.75 - 29.59 \n\n% Contingent consideration liabilities $ 3 &#160; Discounted cash flow \n\nDiscount rate (3) \n\n5.56 - 7.08 \n\n% ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Refer to Note 6 for information on the assumptions and inputs specific to the non-recurring fair value measurements performed in connection with recoverability and impairment tests incurred for certain long-lived assets and goodwill reporting units. \n\n(2) A Monte Carlo valuation model is used for the fair value measurement of the Batu Hijau contingent consideration asset.

The fixed forward contracts were transacted for risk management purposes. The Company has designated the fixed forward contracts as foreign currency cash flow hedges against the forecasted AUD-denominated Tanami Expansion 2 capital expenditures. \n\nTo minimize credit risk, the Company only enters into transactions with counterparties that meet certain credit requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties. The Company believes that the risk of counterparty default is low and its exposure to credit risk is minimal. \n\nThe unrealized changes in fair value have been recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to income during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the underlying hedge transaction becomes probable of not occurring, the related amounts will be reclassified to earnings immediately. For the foreign currency cash flow hedges related to the Tanami Expansion 2 project, amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to earnings through Depreciation and amortization after the project reaches commercial production. \n\nThe following table provides the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges: \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31, 2022 2021 Derivative Assets: Foreign currency cash flow hedges, current (1) \n\n$ 12 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency cash flow hedges, non-current (2) \n\n8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Included in Other current assets in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\n(2) Included in Other non-current assets in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nThe following table provides the losses (gains) recognized in earnings related to the Company's derivative instruments: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Loss (gain) on cash flow hedges: Interest rate contracts (1) \n\n$ 6 &#160; $ 8 &#160; $ 17 &#160; Operating cash flow hedges (2) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 2 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ 19 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________________ \n\n(1) Interest rate contracts relate to swaps entered into, and subsequently settled, associated with the issuance of the 2022 Senior Notes, 2035 Senior Notes, 2039 Senior Notes, and 2042 Senior Notes. The related gains and losses are reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and amortized to Interest expense, net over the term of the respective hedged notes. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $ 1 and $( 8 ), respectively, was reclassified to Other income (loss), net as a result of the redemption and tender offers of the 2022 Senior Notes. Refer to Note 20 for additional information. \n\n(2) Operating cash flow hedges relate to contracts entered into, and subsequently settled, to mitigate the variability of operating costs primarily related to diesel price fluctuations. The amounts are reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings as diesel costs are incurred. The gains (losses) recognized in earnings are included in Costs applicable to sales in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nContingent Consideration Assets and Liabilities \n\nContingent consideration assets and liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration to be received or paid by the Company in conjunction with various sales of assets and investments with future payment contingent upon certain milestones. These contingent consideration assets and liabilities are accounted for at fair value using discounted cash flow models and consist of financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative, but are not designated for hedge accounting under ASC 815.

Barrick operates and holds the remaining interest in the mine. At acquisition, the carrying value of Newmont&#8217;s equity investment in Pueblo Viejo was lower than the underlying net assets of its investment resulting in a basis difference, which is being amortized into Equity income (loss) of affiliates over the remaining estimated useful life of the mine. As of December 31, 2022 the net basis difference was $ 251 . \n\nIn June 2009, Goldcorp entered into a $ 400 shareholder loan agreement with Pueblo Viejo with a term of fifteen years . In April 2012, additional funding of $ 300 was issued to Pueblo Viejo with a term of twelve years . Both loans bear interest at 95 % of LIBOR plus 2.95 % which is compounded semi-annually in arrears on February 28 and August 31 of each year. The loans have no set repayment terms. Both loans were fully repaid in December 2022. \n\nIn November 2020, the Company and Barrick entered into an agreement with Pueblo Viejo to provide additional funding of up to $ 1,300 ($ 520 attributable to Newmont's 40 % ownership interest) through a loan facility for the expansion of Pueblo Viejo's operations (&#8220;Loan Facility&#8221;). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company and Barrick will distribute funds based on their respective proportionate ownership interest in Pueblo Viejo. The Loan Facility bears interest at 95 % of LIBOR plus 4.00 % which is compounded semi-annually in arrears on February 28 and August 31 of each year. The Loan Facility will be provided in two tranches of $ 800 and $ 500 , respectively. Unused proceeds under the first tranche will be available for use under the second tranche. The tranches mature February 28, 2032 and February 28, 2035, respectively. In October 2022, the Loan Facility was amended and now bears interest at 95 % of the 6-month SOFR plus 4.25 %. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding shareholder loans to Pueblo Viejo of $ 356 and $ 260 , with accrued interest of $ 8 and $ 3 , respectively. All loans receivable and accrued interest are included in the Pueblo Viejo equity method investment balance. \n\nIn September 2019, the Company and Barrick entered into a $ 70 revolving loan facility (&#8220;Revolving Facility&#8221;) to provide short-term financing to Pueblo Viejo. The Company will fund 40 % of the borrowings based on its ownership interest in Pueblo Viejo. Under the terms of the Revolving Facility, borrowings earn interest at LIBOR plus 2.09 % and expired on December 31, 2022. In October 2022, the Revolving Facility was amended to extend the expiration date to December 31, 2024 and now bears interest using the 3-month SOFR plus 2.24 %.

These purchases, net of subsequent sales, were included in Other income (loss), net and the net amount is immaterial. There were no amounts due to or due from Pueblo Viejo for gold and silver purchases as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. \n\nNuevaUni&#243;n \n\nThe NuevaUni&#243;n project is located in Chile and is currently in the Company&#8217;s development project pipeline. The project is jointly managed by Newmont and Teck Resources, who holds the remaining interest. At acquisition, the carrying value of Newmont&#8217;s equity investment in NuevaUni&#243;n was lower than the underlying net assets of its investment resulting in a basis difference. This basis difference will be amortized into Equity income (loss) of affiliates over the remaining estimated useful life of the mine beginning when commercial production is declared. As of December 31, 2022 the net basis difference was $ 67 . \n\nNorte Abierto \n\nThe Norte Abierto project is located in Chile and is currently in the Company&#8217;s development project pipeline.

The Existing Credit Agreement was entered into with a syndicate of financial institutions and provided for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contained a letter of credit sub-facility. Per the Amendment, the expiration date of the credit facility was extended from April 4, 2024 to March 30, 2026 and the interest rate on the credit facility was amended to include a margin adjustment based on the Company&#8217;s environment, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) scores. The maximum adjustment resulting from the ESG scores is plus or minus 0.05 %. Facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company&#8217;s senior, uncollateralized, non-current debt. Debt covenants under the amendment are substantially the same as the Existing Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility. There were no amounts outstanding on the letters of credit sub-facility at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company had letters of credit outstanding in the amounts of $ 995 and $ 1,044 , respectively, of which $ 848 and $ 886 represented guarantees for reclamation obligations, respectively. None of these letters of credit have been drawn on for reclamation obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n2021 Senior Notes \n\nIn April 2021, the Company fully redeemed all of its 3.625 % senior notes, with an original maturity date of June 9, 2021, for a redemption price of $ 557 . The redemption price equaled the principal amount of the outstanding senior notes of $ 550 plus accrued and unpaid interest in accordance with the terms. Interest on the senior notes ceased to accrue on the date of redemption. \n\n2022 Senior Notes \n\nIn 2020, the Company purchased approximately $ 500 of its 2022 Senior Notes through debt tender offers. In December 2021, the Company fully redeemed all of the outstanding 2022 Senior Notes. The redemption price of $ 496 equaled the principal amount of the outstanding 2022 Senior Notes of $ 492 plus accrued and unpaid interest in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Notes. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\n2023 Senior Notes \n\nAt January 1, 2020, the Company held the 2023 Newmont Senior Notes and 2023 Goldcorp Senior Notes, due on March 15, 2023 and bearing an annual interest rate of 3.70 %, comprised of principal amounts of $ 810 and $ 190 , respectively. \n\nIn 2020, the Company purchased approximately $ 487 and $ 99 of its 2023 Newmont Senior Notes and 2023 Goldcorp Senior Notes, respectively, through debt tender offers. \n\nIn December 2021, the Company purchased approximately $ 89 and $ 4 of its 2023 Newmont Senior Notes and 2023 Goldcorp Senior Notes, respectively, through debt tender offers. The tender offers were completed with the proceeds from the issuance of the 2032 Senior Notes. See below for additional information on the 2032 Senior Notes. In December 2021, subsequent to the debt tender offer, the Company extinguished the outstanding 2023 Newmont Senior Notes by way of defeasance with funds in trust, which were subsequently used by the trust for full redemption in January 2022. The redemption price of $ 246 equaled the principal amount of the outstanding 2023 Newmont Senior Notes of $ 234 plus accrued and unpaid interest and future coupon payments in accordance with the terms of the 2023 Newmont Senior Notes. \n\nIn January 2022, the Company fully redeemed all of the outstanding 2023 Goldcorp Senior Notes. The redemption price of $ 90 equaled the principal amount of the outstanding 2023 Goldcorp Senior Notes of $ 87 plus accrued and unpaid interest and future coupon payments in accordance with the terms of the 2023 Goldcorp Senior Notes. \n\n2030 Senior Notes \n\nIn March 2020, the Company completed a public offering of $ 1,000 unsecured Senior Notes due October 1, 2030 (&#8220;2030 Senior Notes&#8221;). Net proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes were $ 985 . The 2030 Senior Notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 2.25 % per annum. The proceeds from this issuance, supplemented with cash from the Company's balance sheet, were used to fund the debt tender offers of the 2023 Newmont Senior Notes and the 2023 Goldcorp Senior Notes in 2020. \n\n2032 Senior Notes \n\nIn December 2021, the Company completed a public offering of $ 1,000 sustainability-linked, unsecured convertible Senior Notes due July 15, 2032 (\"2032 Senior Notes\") for net proceeds of approximately $ 992 . Per the terms of the 2032 Senior Notes, the 2032 Senior Notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 2.60 % per annum and are subject to an increase if the Company fails to reach stated targets by 2030. Beginning in 2031, the coupon of the 2032 Senior Notes is linked to the Company&#8217;s performance against the 2030 emissions reduction targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles targets. The maximum adjustment resulting from the sustainability-linked objectives is 0.60 %. The proceeds from this issuance were used to redeem the remaining balance of the 2023 Newmont Senior Notes and the 2023 Goldcorp Senior Notes in December 2021 and January 2022, respectively. \n\nDebt Covenants \n\nThe Company&#8217;s senior notes and revolving credit facility contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, leases, sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. Furthermore, the Company&#8217;s senior notes and corporate revolving credit facility contain covenants that include, limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets. \n\nThe corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.50 % in addition to the covenants noted above. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company and its related entities were in compliance with all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults. \n\nNOTE 21 LEASE AND OTHER FINANCING OBLIGATIONS \n\nThe Company primarily has operating and finance leases for corporate and regional offices, processing facilities, and mining equipment.

Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the Company&#8217;s commitments and contingencies specifically described herein are included in Corporate and Other. The Yanacocha matters \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nrelate to the South America reportable segment. The Newmont Ghana Gold and Newmont Golden Ridge matters relate to the Africa reportable segment. The CC&#38;V matter and the Mexico tax matter relates to the North America reportable segment. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nRefer to Note 5 for further information regarding reclamation and remediation. Details about certain significant matters are discussed below. \n\nMinera Yanacocha S.R.L. - 100 % Newmont Owned \n\nIn early 2015 and again in June 2017, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment (&#8220;MINAM&#8221;), issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria modified the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In December 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards. These Peruvian regulations allow time to formulate a compliance plan and make any necessary changes to achieve compliance. \n\nIn February 2017, Yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the MINEM. The Company did not receive a response or comments to this submission until April 2021. During this interim period, Yanacocha separately submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") modification considering the ongoing operations and the projects to be developed and obtained authorization from MINEM for such projects. This authorization included a deadline for compliance with the modified water quality criteria by January 2024. In May 2022, Yanacocha submitted a proposed modification to this plan requesting an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations in 2027. In the event that MINEM does not grant Yanacocha an extension of the previously authorized timeline for, and agree to, the updated compliance achievement plan, fines and penalties relating to noncompliance may result beyond January 2024. \n\nThe Company currently operates five water treatment plants at Yanacocha that have been and currently meet all currently applicable water discharge requirements. The Company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by MINAM, as referenced above, will be met. This also includes performing a comprehensive update to the Yanacocha reclamation plan to address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. The Company's asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2022, included updates primarily to the expected construction of two water treatment plants, a related increase in the annual operating costs over the extended closure period, and initial consideration of known risks (including the associated risk that these water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). These ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, were progressed in 2022 as the study team continued to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. While certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, in conjunction with the Company's annual 2022 update process for all asset retirement obligations, the Company recorded an increase of $ 511 to the Yanacocha reclamation liability based on progress of the closure studies with a corresponding non-cash charge of $ 529 recorded to reclamation expense related to portions of the site operations no longer in production with no expected substantive future economic value and $ 18 recorded as a decrease to the asset retirement cost for producing areas of the operation. The annual 2022 update related primarily to higher capital costs for construction of the two water treatment plants due to updated design considerations and recent inflation and supply chain disruptions on the estimated construction costs, as well as post-closure management costs. The ultimate construction costs of the two water treatment plants remains highly uncertain as ongoing study work and assessment of opportunities that incorporates the latest design considerations remain in progress. These and other additional risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of the Company's tailings storage facility management, review of Yanacocha&#8217;s water balance and storm water management system, and review of post-closure management costs, could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha. \n\nYanacocha experienced heavy rainfall in early 2022, above average historical levels, which resulted in significant water balance stress and required active emergency management. Yanacocha has been in communication with Organismo Evaluaci&#243;n y Fiscalizaci&#243;n Ambiental (&#8220;OEFA&#8221;), under MINAM, and local government regarding the emergency measures undertaken and contingency planning. Yanacocha was able to prevent any offsite release of untreated water, but did need to accumulate untreated water in mine pits. If accumulation in pits or other emergency measures are deemed a violation of existing permits, it could result in fines and penalties for unauthorized discharge. Such fines and penalties, if ultimately assessed, are currently unknown and otherwise cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Extended periods of rainfall, more extreme storm events or increased overall rainfall beyond historical or planned levels may also result in flooding or stress of mine pits and maintenance and storage facilities (e.g., tailings water), unpermitted off-site discharges, delays to planned study work, increased cost related to water infrastructure adjustments and potential negative impacts to permitting and operations. \n\nCripple Creek &#38; Victor Gold Mining Company LLC - 100 % Newmont Owned \n\nIn December 2021, Cripple Creek &#38; Victor Gold Mining Company LLC (&#8220;CC&#38;V&#8221;, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) entered into a Settlement Agreement (&#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) with the Water Quality Control Division of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (the &#8220;Division&#8221;) with a mutual objective of resolving issues associated with the new discharge permits issued by the Division in January 2021 for the historic Carlton Tunnel. The Carlton Tunnel was a historic tunnel completed in 1941 with \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nthe purpose of draining the southern portion of the mining district, subsequently consolidated by CC&#38;V. CC&#38;V has held discharge permits for the Carlton Tunnel since 1983, but the January 2021 new permits contained new water quality limits. The Settlement Agreement, involves the installation of interim passive water treatment and ongoing monitoring over the next three years, and then more long-term water treatment installed with target compliance by November 2027. In 2022, the Company studied various interim passive water treatment options, reported the study results to the Division, and based on an evaluation of additional semi-passive options that involve the usage of power at the portal, updated the remediation liability to $ 20 at December 31, 2022. CC&#38;V continues to study alternative long-term remediation plans for water discharged from the Carlton Tunnel. Depending on the remediation plans that may ultimately be agreed with the Division, a material adjustment to the remediation liability may be required. \n\nDawn Mining Company LLC (&#8220;Dawn&#8221;) - 58.19 % Newmont Owned \n\nMidnite mine site and Dawn mill site . Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the EPA. \n\nAs per the Consent Decree approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington on January 17, 2012, the following actions were required of Newmont, Dawn, the Department of the Interior and the EPA: (i) Newmont and Dawn would design, construct and implement the cleanup plan selected by the EPA in 2006 for the Midnite mine site; (ii) Newmont and Dawn would reimburse the EPA for its past costs associated with overseeing the work; (iii) the Department of the Interior would contribute a lump sum amount toward past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite mine site; (iv) Newmont and Dawn would be responsible for all future EPA oversight costs and Midnite mine site cleanup costs; and (v) Newmont would post a surety bond for work at the site. \n\nDuring 2012, the Department of Interior contributed its share of past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite mine site. In 2016, Newmont completed the remedial design process, with the exception of the new WTP design which was awaiting the approval of the new NPDES permit. Subsequently, the new NPDES permit was received in 2017 and the WTP design commenced in 2018. The EPA completed their assessment and approval of the WTP design in 2021 and Newmont has selected contractors for the construction of the new water treatment plant and effluent pipeline. Construction of the effluent pipeline began in 2021, and construction of the new WTP began in 2022. \n\nThe Dawn mill site is regulated by the Washington Department of Health and is in the process of being closed in accordance with the federal Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, and associated Washington state regulations. Remediation at the Dawn mill site began in 2013. The Tailing Disposal Area 1-4 reclamation earthworks component was completed during 2017 with the embankment erosion protection completed in the second quarter of 2018. The remaining closure activities will consist primarily of finalizing an Alternative Concentration Limit application (the \"ACL application\") submitted in 2020 to the Washington Department of Health to address groundwater issues, and also evaporating the remaining balance of process water at the site. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Washington Department of Health provided comments on the ACL application, which Newmont is evaluating and to which it will provide a response. \n\nThe remediation liability for the Midnite mine site and Dawn mill site is approximately $ 188 , assumed 100 % by Newmont, at December 31, 2022. \n\nOther Legal Matters \n\nNewmont Corporation, as well as Newmont Canada Corporation, and Newmont Canada FN Holdings ULC &#8211; 100 % Newmont Owned \n\nKirkland Lake Gold Inc., which was acquired by Agnico Eagle Mines Limited in 2022 (still referred to herein as &#8220;Kirkland&#8221; for ease of reference), owns certain mining and mineral rights in northeastern Ontario, Canada, referred to here as the Holt-McDermott property, on which it suspended operations in April 2020. A subsidiary of the Company has a retained royalty obligation (&#8220;Holt royalty obligation&#8221;) to Royal Gold, Inc. (&#8220;Royal Gold&#8221;) for production on the Holt-McDermott property. In August 2020, the Company and Kirkland signed a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the &#8220;Kirkland Agreement&#8221;). As part of the Kirkland Agreement, the Company purchased an option (the &#8220;Holt option&#8221;) for $ 75 from Kirkland for the mining and mineral rights subject to the Holt royalty obligation. The Company has the right to exercise the Holt option and acquire ownership to the mineral interests subject to the Holt royalty obligation in the event Kirkland intends to resume operations and process material subject to the obligation. Kirkland has the right to assume the Company&#8217;s Holt royalty obligation at any time, in which case the Holt option would terminate. \n\nOn August 16, 2021, International Royalty Corporation (&#8220;IRC&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, filed an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Newmont Corporation, Newmont Canada Corporation, Newmont Canada FN Holdings ULC (collectively \"Newmont\"), and certain Kirkland defendants (collectively \"Kirkland\"). IRC alleges the Kirkland Agreement is oppressive to the interests of Royal Gold under the Nova Scotia Companies Act and the Canada Business Corporations Act, and that, by entering into the Kirkland Agreement, Newmont breached its contractual obligations to Royal Gold. IRC seeks declaratory relief, and $ 350 in alleged royalty payments that it claims Newmont expected to pay under the Holt royalty obligation, but for the Kirkland Agreement. Kirkland filed a motion seeking dismissal of the case against it, which the court granted in October 2022. Newmont submitted a demand for particulars on February 6, 2023. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nNWG Investments Inc. v. Fronteer Gold Inc. \n\nIn April 2011, Newmont acquired Fronteer Gold Inc. (&#8220;Fronteer&#8221;). \n\nFronteer acquired NewWest Gold Corporation (&#8220;NewWest Gold&#8221;) in September 2007. At the time of that acquisition, NWG Investments Inc. (&#8220;NWG&#8221;) owned approximately 86 % of NewWest Gold and an individual named Jacob Safra owned or controlled 100 % of NWG. Prior to its acquisition of NewWest Gold, Fronteer entered into a June 2007 lock-up agreement with NWG providing that, among other things, NWG would support Fronteer&#8217;s acquisition of NewWest Gold. At that time, Fronteer owned approximately 47 % of Aurora Energy Resources Inc. (&#8220;Aurora&#8221;), which, among other things, had a uranium exploration project in Labrador, Canada. \n\nNWG contends that, during the negotiations leading up to the lock-up agreement, Fronteer represented to NWG, among other things, that Aurora would commence uranium mining in Labrador by 2013, that this was a firm date, that Aurora faced no current environmental issues in Labrador and that Aurora&#8217;s competitors faced delays in commencing uranium mining. NWG further contends that it entered into the lock-up agreement and agreed to support Fronteer&#8217;s acquisition of NewWest Gold in reliance upon these purported representations. On October 11, 2007, less than three weeks after the Fronteer-NewWest Gold transaction closed, a member of the Nunatsiavut Assembly introduced a motion calling for the adoption of a moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. On April 8, 2008, the Nunatsiavut Assembly adopted a three-year moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. NWG contends that Fronteer was aware during the negotiations of the NWG/Fronteer lock-up agreement that the Nunatsiavut Assembly planned on adopting this moratorium and that its adoption would preclude Aurora from commencing uranium mining by 2013, but Fronteer nonetheless fraudulently induced NWG to enter into the lock-up agreement. \n\nOn September 24, 2012, NWG served a summons and complaint on the Company, and then amended the complaint to add Newmont Canada Holdings ULC as a defendant. The complaint also named Fronteer Gold Inc. and Mark O&#8217;Dea as defendants. The complaint sought rescission of the merger between Fronteer and NewWest Gold and $ 750 in damages. In August 2013 the Supreme Court of New York, New York County issued an order granting the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens. Subsequently, NWG filed a notice of appeal of the decision and then a notice of dismissal of the appeal on March 24, 2014. \n\nOn February 26, 2014, NWG filed a lawsuit in Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Fronteer Gold Inc., Newmont Mining Corporation, Newmont Canada Holdings ULC, Newmont FH B.V. and Mark O&#8217;Dea. The Ontario complaint is based upon substantially the same allegations contained in the New York lawsuit with claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. NWG seeks disgorgement of profits since the close of the NWG deal on September 24, 2007 and damages in the amount of C$ 1,200 . Newmont, along with other defendants, served the plaintiff with its statement of defense on October 17, 2014. Newmont, along with the other defendants, filed a motion to dismiss based on delay on November 29, 2022. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome. \n\nNewmont Ghana Gold Limited and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited - 100 % Newmont Owned \n\nOn December 24, 2018, two individual plaintiffs, who are members of the Ghana Parliament (&#8220;Plaintiffs&#8221;), filed a writ to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ghana. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the Statement of Plaintiff&#8217;s Case outlining the details of the Plaintiff&#8217;s case and subsequently served Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (&#8220;NGGL&#8221;) and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited (&#8220;NGRL&#8221;) along with the other named defendants, the Attorney General of Ghana, the Minerals Commission of Ghana and 33 other mining companies with interests in Ghana. The Plaintiffs allege that under article 268 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana, the mining company defendants are not entitled to carry out any exploitation of minerals or other natural resources in Ghana, unless their respective transactions, contracts or concessions are ratified or exempted from ratification by the Parliament of Ghana. Newmont&#8217;s current mining leases are both ratified by Parliament; NGGL June 13, 2001 mining lease, ratified by Parliament on October 21, 2008, and NGRL January 19, 2010 mining lease; ratified by Parliament on December 3, 2015. The writ alleges that any mineral exploitation prior to Parliamentary ratification is unconstitutional. The Plaintiffs seek several remedies including: (i) a declaration as to the meaning of constitutional language at issue; (ii) an injunction precluding exploitation of minerals for any mining company without prior Parliamentary ratification; (iii) a declaration that all revenue as a result of violation of the Constitution shall be accounted for and recovered via cash equivalent; and (iv) an order that the Attorney General and Minerals Commission submit all un-ratified mining leases, undertakings or contracts to Parliament for ratification. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome. \n\nOther Commitments and Contingencies \n\nAs part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental remediation, reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $ 1,872 and $ 1,927 , respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company addresses through its ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. However, the Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements through existing or alternative means, as they arise. \n\nNEWMONT CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) \n\nNewmont is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Except in the above described proceedings, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations. \n\nIn connection with the Company's investment in Galore Creek, Newmont will owe NovaGold Resources Inc. $ 75 upon the earlier of approval to construct a mine, mill and all related infrastructure for the Galore Creek project or the initiation of construction of a mine, mill or related infrastructure. The amount due is non-interest bearing. The decision for an approval and commencement of construction is contingent on the results of a prefeasibility study which is currently under way and feasibility study which has not yet occurred. As such, this amount has not been accrued. \n\nDeferred payments to Barrick of $ 120 and $ 124 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, are to be satisfied through funding a portion of Barrick&#8217;s share of project expenditures at the Norte Abierto project. These deferred payments to Barrick are included in Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities . \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)) as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#8217;s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company&#8217;s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company&#8217;s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013. Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, at December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective. \n\nAs permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for proportionately consolidated entities, the Company&#8217;s management excluded NGM from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, as management does not have the ability to dictate, modify or assess the controls at NGM. The Company has implemented internal controls over financial reporting for recognizing its proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, and operations of NGM. Refer to Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for NGM's \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\" for Opinion on the Financial Statements and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. \n\nNGM represented 19% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated Total assets at December 31, 2022, while its Sales comprised 18% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nErnst &#38; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2022 and the year then ended included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, at December 31, 2022, which is included herein. \n\nChanges in Internal Controls \n\nThere were no changes in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newmont Corporation \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Newmont Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Newmont Corporation (the Company), based on our audit and the report of other auditors, maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe did not examine the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of Nevada Gold Mines LLC, a 38.5% owned investment which is proportionately consolidated, whose financial statements reflect total assets and sales constituting 19% and 18%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of Nevada Gold Mines LLC&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the effectiveness of Nevada Gold Mines LLC&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes and financial statement schedule in Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit and the report of the other auditors. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit and the report of other auditors provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nDenver, Colorado \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\n"
