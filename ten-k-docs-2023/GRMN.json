Garmin&#8217;s products are created by its engineering and development staff. Garmin&#8217;s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin&#8217;s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin&#8217;s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and cartographic engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin&#8217;s success. \n\n&#160; \n\nManufacturing and Operations \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi, Jhongli, LinKou, and Xinshi, its China facility in Yangzhou, its Netherlands facility in Oegstgeest, its Poland facility in Wroclaw, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon. Garmin believes that its operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets. \n\n&#160; \n\nSpecifically, Garmin believes that the vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality, and time to market. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost: Garmin&#8217;s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency and resulting in lower cost. Garmin&#8217;s vertical integration approach enables leveraging of manufacturing resources across high, mid, and low volume products. Sharing of these resources across product lines favorably affects Garmin&#8217;s costs to produce its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of higher volume products. The ownership and integration of its resources allows Garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of its products, yielding improved cost. \n\n&#160; \n\nQuality: Garmin&#8217;s automation and advanced production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enable Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our products. Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is shared with the development teams, providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin&#8217;s design, manufacturing, distribution, and service functions in its U.S., Taiwan, China, and U.K. facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Garmin&#8217;s automotive operations in Taiwan, China, U.K., and Olathe have achieved IATF 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. Garmin&#8217;s Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon aviation operations in the U.S. have achieved certification to AS9100, a quality standard for the aviation industry. Garmin has also implemented multiple health and safety management systems and achieved certification to the ISO 45001 standard for Health and Safety Management at facilities in the U.S., Taiwan, Poland, and China. \n\n&#160; \n\nTime to Market: Garmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products, allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing. This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market. \n\n&#160; \n\nMaterials \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin purchases components from a large number of qualified suppliers. Although many components essential to Garmin&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other suppliers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. While extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to meet customer demand due to component shortages or increased lead times, or cause us to incur higher product costs, we believe these potential disruptions would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. \n\n&#160; \n\nSeasonality \n\n&#160; \n\nOur net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Sales of our fitness and outdoor products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season. Sales of our marine and consumer auto products are generally higher in the second quarter. Sales in these segments are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Our aviation and auto OEM products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications, regulatory mandates, auto program manufacturing, and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntellectual Property \n\n&#160; \n\nOur success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of January 5, 2023, Garmin has been issued over 1,800 patents throughout the world and holds more than 1,080 trademark registrations. The duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law. We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate. Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin&#8217;s rights in its proprietary technologies. \n\n&#160; \n\nThere is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin&#8217;s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes. Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget. Historically, capital expenditures associated with environmental controls have not been material and compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on the Company&#8217;s competitive position. \n\n&#160; \n\nMany of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency. Garmin is also subject to extended producer responsibility laws and regulations requiring manufacturers to be responsible for collection, recovery, and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products. Historically, compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on our profitability. We have processes to monitor environmental law changes and to evaluate the potential impact of such laws to our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin has a global environmental policy and is committed to working to protect the environment throughout various aspects of our business. Garmin has implemented multiple environmental management systems and achieved certification to the ISO 14001 standard for Environmental Management at facilities in the U.S., U.K., Taiwan, Poland, and China. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin strives to reduce our environmental impact by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts. Garmin is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through direct carbon emissions reduction and elimination strategies. Garmin has several locations that utilize renewable electricity, including facilities in Olathe, Kansas. Garmin also has made efforts to reduce waste and increase recycling and composting. \n\n&#160; \n\nHuman Capital \n\n&#160; \n\nSuccessful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing, and retaining key employees and members of our management team. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by generous compensation and benefits, and through programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 19,700 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom approximately 6,600 were in the Americas region, 10,500 were in APAC (Asia Pacific and Australian Continent), and 2,600 were in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). Garmin&#8217;s vertical integration model enables us to provide a variety of opportunities across many different professions including engineering, human resources, information technology, marketing, sales, and operations. The Company&#8217;s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered approximately 5,500 people worldwide as of December 31, 2022. Garmin&#8217;s manufacturing staff, which numbered approximately 8,900 people worldwide as of December 31, 2022, includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin&#8217;s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin respects the right of all employees to form and join an association to represent their interests as employees, to organize, and to bargain collectively or individually. We also respect any employee&#8217;s choice to refrain from joining a union. Except for some of Garmin&#8217;s employees in Sweden, none of Garmin&#8217;s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, as evidenced by a strong company culture and positive relations between the Company and our employees. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe offer a range of generous benefits to our employees that enable us to attract and retain leading talent. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include stock compensation, savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides employees an opportunity to acquire company ownership for a discounted price. We also invest significant resources in our talent development programs to provide employees with the training and education they need to help achieve their career goals, build relevant skills, and lead their organizations. Employee Resource Groups provide opportunities for employees to connect, network, and become involved in community engagement initiatives. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe support local community engagement initiatives where we have a business presence, and we provide opportunities for employees to give back to those communities. One such initiative is through active engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (&#8220;STEM&#8221;) community outreach programs. Our strategic aim in these educational programs is to educate and encourage local students to pursue careers in the engineering field, especially students in underrepresented groups, which we believe benefits not only our company but the overall industry. \n\n&#160; \n\n"

      "text": " Item 1A.Ri sk Factors \n\nThe risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\nRisks Related to the Company \n\nIf we are not successful in the continued development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, overall demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits are not entirely offset. \n\nWe expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. \n\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, supply chain constraints, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nIf we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, the associated loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. \n\nThe markets for many of our products and services are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to replicate certain features offered by our products and services or respond more rapidly to emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nMaturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of these devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits. \n\nWe have experienced periods of annual growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices. However, we have recently experienced declines in sales and profits in our fitness segment. If the overall wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have made and expect to continue making significant investments in the auto OEM operating segment, which will continue to negatively impact total Company profits and may negatively impact shareholder value if the operating segment fails to become profitable. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have been awarded several tier-one and tier-two auto OEM supplier contracts. To fulfill the associated program commitments, we have invested significantly in facilities, research and development, and other operating expenses and expect to continue doing so. Operating margins associated with these auto OEM programs will negatively impact consolidated operating margin as auto OEM revenue increases as a percentage of consolidated revenue. If we are not successful in winning additional contracts and substantially leveraging our past and future investments, operating losses in the auto OEM segment will continue to negatively impact total Company profits and may negatively impact shareholder value. We may incur substantial restructuring costs if we are unable to generate profits from auto OEM contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe depend on third party suppliers and licensors, some of which are sole source, for technology and components used in our products. Our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers or licensors are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. The availability of high-quality components at reasonable cost is essential to the successful production and sale of our products. Some components we use are from sole source suppliers. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have and may continue to experience shortages of certain components as well as delays in procuring certain components. In addition, a shortage in supply of components may result in an increase of the costs of procuring these components. If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis or if we are unable to obtain components from an alternative source, or if the price of alternative components is prohibitive, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur products are also dependent on certain licensed technology and content. If we are unable to continue sourcing such technology and content from our licensors and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if our relationships with our licensors change detrimentally, our ability to provide certain features in our products would be seriously harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\nPublic health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases have had and will likely continue to have significant impacts on our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nWidespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could continue to have, significant impacts on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, creating disruption and uncertainty around the world, which has resulted in, and we expect will continue to result in, a change in overall demand for certain of our products and other operational impacts. There are unknown factors, such as the duration and severity of the pandemic, evolving variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 and the efficacy of vaccines against those variants, the nature and length of actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals to contain or mitigate its impact, the severity and duration of the economic impact caused by the pandemic, the uncertainty surrounding the distribution and uptake of vaccines, the impact of employees who are unable to work due to quarantine requirements or who decline to adhere to government-mandated vaccination or testing requirements, along with the effectiveness of our response, that may materially impact our business operations, results of operations, and its ultimate impact on our financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nDemand for certain of our products has been, and may continue to be, affected in several ways by COVID-19, or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease. Some consumers and OEM customers have been and may continue to be less able or less likely to purchase certain of our products due to economic hardships, governmental restrictions affecting them and the retail outlets that sell our products, voluntary behavior changes associated with public health guidance, the prioritization of other goods and services by online retailers that sell our products, restrictions on the ability of online retailers to ship products to certain areas, the cancellation of trade shows and other events that are otherwise important in the marketing and sale of our products, and the potential failure and closure of retail outlets and online retailers that sell our products. Certain of our sales and distribution offices have experienced and may again experience temporary closure due to governmental restrictions. Additional or prolonged closures of certain sales and distribution offices could affect our ability to market and distribute products to meet customer demand. The adverse impacts of the pandemic have created economic stress in the global marketplace, periods of high levels of unemployment, loss of income and/or wealth for some individuals, and general economic uncertainty. These conditions have affected and are expected to continue to affect the willingness or ability of some customers to purchase certain of our products or those of original equipment manufacturers in which our products are installed. While we experienced increased demand for certain of our products in prior periods during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been and may continue to be a decline in demand for certain of our products as people return to pre-pandemic lifestyles. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur supply chain has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have experienced delays in procuring and may continue to be unable to procure certain components from our suppliers, and the cost of procuring certain components has increased and could continue to increase. We have faced logistics constraints and higher freight costs, the scope and severity of which may intensify. Reduced demand for certain of our products has resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced utilization of certain of our manufacturing facilities and higher per-unit costs for certain products. Certain of our manufacturing facilities have experienced and may in the future experience inopportune temporary closures or reduced hours, which could adversely affect the costs incurred to produce our products and our ability to meet demand. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have several other operational impacts on our business, which has and may continue to include employees working remotely, temporarily ceasing operations in some offices due to government restrictions, business travel restrictions, and the cancellation of events that are otherwise important in the development, marketing and sale of our products. These changes in our business operations may result in reduced efficiency and lower productivity. Similar operational and financial hardships on our business partners may result in aged or uncollectable receivables, and the reduced demand for certain of our products could result in obsolescence of certain inventory. If the economy experiences a sustained downturn of significant proportion that impacts portions of our business, we may also need to incur the costs and organizational impacts of personnel restructuring. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditional risks and impacts including gross margin fluctuation, foreign currency fluctuations, product development challenges, impacts to our key personnel, and dependencies on third party suppliers, may be heightened as a result of COVID-19, or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease. There are further unknown risks and impacts due to the uncertainty and rapidly evolving nature of a pandemic including, but not limited to, uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic, the unprecedented imposition of preventative measures by governments that impact the economy and normal operations of a business and the timing and manner of relaxation of those measures. Potential future health emergencies may present risks and impacts similar to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to manage these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially impacted. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur results of operations and financial condition are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency translation. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe movement of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar affects the U.S. Dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated sales. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar has had and may continue to have a significant adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin, and profitability, or may cause us to raise international pricing, which has reduced and may continue to reduce demand for certain of our products. Conversely, a strengthening of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase product costs and operating expenses denominated in those currencies, which could materially adversely affect profitability. We have not historically used financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risks. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to certain other currencies. The majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. However, because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur principal manufacturing facilities are located in Taiwan. Deterioration of relations between Taiwan and the People&#8217;s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future, could cause disruption to our manufacturing operations and suppliers based in Taiwan which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands, and all of mainland China. The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government. Although significant economic and cultural relations exist between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan. There is also a risk that the PRC government may unilaterally seek to occupy Taiwan, by force if necessary, without a clear triggering event. In this scenario, Garmin&#8217;s manufacturing facilities and suppliers based in Taiwan could be subject to disruptions that could have a material negative impact to our operations. The United States' relations with Taiwan are governed by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which signifies when the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC, referred to as the &#34;one-China&#34; policy. Deviations from the &#34;one-China&#34; policy could lead to adverse changes in China-U.S. and China-Taiwan relations and could materially adversely affect our operations in Taiwan in the future. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business and reputation have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company and its global supply chain have experienced and are expected to continue to be exposed to information technology system failures and network disruptions including those caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have technology and processes in place designed to detect and respond to such failures and disruptions. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, and the nature of other potential incidents change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, our detection and response measures may be ineffective or inadequate. Furthermore, even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors and omissions may still occur resulting in system failures and/or disruptions to our information technology infrastructure. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s business continuity and disaster recovery planning, or those of others in our global supply chain, may not be able to sufficiently mitigate all threats. \n\n&#160; \n\nSuch failures or disruptions can materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition through, among other things, a disruption of internal operations, including order processing, invoicing, and manufacturing and distribution of products, and a loss of functionality of critical systems and online services. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to conduct additional employee training, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. Although we maintain cyber insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and significant self-insured retentions, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\n&#160; \n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of proprietary or confidential information, including personal information, could result in significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have experienced, and are expected to continue to experience, malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems that seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of proprietary and confidential information. A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of others in our global supply chain could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property, confidential and proprietary information, or that of our business partners, as well as our users&#8217; or employees' personal information, which could compromise our competitive position, reputation, operating results, and financial condition. Also, if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of our intellectual property, confidential and proprietary information, or that of our business partners, or the personal information of our users or employees, we may be subject to private litigation, government investigations, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs. Although we maintain cyber insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and significant self-insured retentions, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business would suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur future success depends significantly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, and administrative personnel. Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position has been and is expected to continue to be difficult. The overall shortage in qualified workforce personnel combined with the increased willingness of companies to hire such personnel in fully remote positions has increased, and in the future may continue to increase our compensation costs in order for us to retain such personnel. If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, our business and growth prospects will be harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. Swiss law prohibits us from paying certain severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. We do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast due to our increasingly diverse product portfolio, intensifying competition in the markets for our products, and the maturing of markets for some of our products. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand have caused and could in the future cause the following challenges to our operations: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough, due to supply chain issues or other constraints, to meet unexpected demand. \n\n&#8226; Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components, higher freight costs associated with urgent distribution of the products, and other expenses. These higher costs could lower our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. \n\n&#8226; If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. \n\n&#160; \n\nChanges in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur tax positions could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns, particularly in the U.S., Switzerland, Taiwan, and United Kingdom (U.K.). We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. \n\n&#160; \n\nGlobal taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinational corporations. While these recommendations do not change tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements. Partially to respond to changes to global tax standards, we initiated an intercompany transaction in 2020 which migrates ownership of certain intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States, which is the primary location of research, development and executive management. At the end of this migration, a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the U.S. Due to the subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing associated with this intercompany transaction, we are pursuing an advanced pricing agreement with relevant jurisdictions to provide certainty regarding the pricing. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of the final advanced pricing agreement and related negotiations, which could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows for periods during negotiation and upon finalization. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2021, the OECD continued work on the BEPS project by issuing a statement regarding a two-pillar solution which includes within &#8220;Pillar Two&#8221; a global minimum tax. Numerous countries have signed onto the OECD statement including Switzerland, the U.S. and the U.K. Recently, Switzerland&#8217;s Federal Council proposed legislation which would implement a minimum tax of 15% in 2024. Neither the OECD statement nor proposed legislation changes actual tax law, but these actions may lead to legislation in those countries in which we operate. The passage of a minimum tax may result in an increase in the tax paid by the Company which could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, most notably in the area of transfer pricing. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. \n\n&#160; \n\nChanges to trade regulations, including trade restrictions, sanctions, or tariffs, could significantly harm our results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nTrade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect our business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and the PRC have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from the PRC. Many other countries have considered or imposed similar measures. The imposition of additional governmental controls or regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade, trade sanctions, or tariffs, particularly those applicable to materials or goods from the PRC, could have a substantial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nEconomic, regulatory, and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. We have operations outside the United States that make up a significant portion of our total revenue, which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale. Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue in the past, and could in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nGross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. \n\n&#160; \n\nGross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of other factors, including product mix, foreign exchange rates, freight and component costs, manufacturing facility utilization, and unit volumes. In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product&#8217;s life. To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon others&#8217; rights or are infringed upon by others. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. In addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries. Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings. Third parties have claimed and may in the future claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights. For example, individuals and groups have purchased and may in future purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers. The number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement. Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming and at the present time cost-effective insurance is not available. We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur products and services may be affected by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur products and services, or those of our OEM customers in which our products are installed, could be affected by design and manufacturing defects. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in our products and services, and may have limited ability to respond to those impacting our OEM customers. Failure to do so can result in recalls, product replacements or modifications, reputational harm, and significant warranty and other expenses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf our products malfunction or contain errors or defects, we could also be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of litigation or damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. \n\nWe are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable and could harm our results of operations and financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources and increased warranty claims, and litigation. \n\n&#160; \n\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or use competing products. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs a business that operates worldwide, we are subject to complex and changing global laws and regulations, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, including those in the following areas: telecommunications; environmental, health and safety; labor and employment; antitrust; data privacy and security; consumer protection; product liability; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls; anti&#8211;money laundering; and tax. \n\n&#160; \n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting our global operations. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable global laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that at all times we will be in compliance with all global regulations given their multitude, complexity and ever-changing nature. If we are found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business is subject to a variety of United States and international laws, regulations and other legal obligations regarding data protection. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data. Our users&#8217; personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, gender, heart rates, sleeping patterns, GPS-based location, and activity patterns. \n\n&#160; \n\nRegulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, including in the United States, have enacted or are considering enacting a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties, governmental investigations and regulatory proceedings, litigation, harm to our brand, and a decrease in the use of our products and services. Many of these laws provide for significant penalties. Under the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, for example, potential penalties can be as high as 4% of a company&#8217;s total global revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\nSome of our products are subject to governmental regulation or certification. Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis, either due to government shutdown or other delays in the certification process, could harm our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft. To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers&#8217; ability to sell airplanes. Delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers. Additionally, failure of the United States Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in a shutdown of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees, due to partial or complete government shutdowns or otherwise, could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. Therefore, such inabilities or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC in the United States and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin&#8217;s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin&#8217;s products, or losing certification for Garmin&#8217;s existing products could adversely affect our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nChanges in our United States federal income tax classification, or that of our subsidiaries, could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10% or greater U.S. shareholders. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;2017 Act&#8221;) signed on December 22, 2017 may have changed the consequences to U.S. shareholders that own, or are considered to own, as a result of the attribution rules, ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a non-U.S. corporation (a 10% U.S. shareholder) under the U.S. federal income tax law applicable to owners of U.S. controlled foreign corporations (&#8220;CFCs&#8221;). \n\n&#160; \n\nThe 2017 Act repealed Internal Revenue Code Section 958(b)(4), which, unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance, may result in classification of certain of the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries as CFCs with respect to any single 10% U.S. shareholder. This may be the result without regard to whether 10% U.S. shareholders together own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company as was the case under prior rules. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditional tax consequences to 10% U.S. shareholders of a CFC may result from other provisions of the 2017 Act. For example, the 2017 Act added Section 951A which requires a 10% U.S. shareholder of a CFC to include in income its pro-rata share of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of the CFC. The 2017 Act also eliminated the requirement in Section 951(a) necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a CFC for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10% U.S. shareholder to have a current income inclusion. \n\n&#160; \n\nFrom time to time, the Company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program. These measures could inadvertently create additional 10% U.S. shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above. We urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 Act revisions to the U.S. federal income tax law applicable to owners of CFCs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability. \n\n&#160; \n\nNatural disasters, catastrophic events, or climate change and associated requirements and pressures could affect our financial results. \n\n&#160; \n\nNatural disasters and extreme weather events, such as tsunamis, typhoons, floods, wildfires, or earthquakes, could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory. Global climate change could also result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. For descriptions and locations of our principal properties, see Item 2, &#8220;Properties&#8221;. These events could also have an impact on our suppliers and affect our supply chain or our customers and affect the demand for our products. If our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events, our financial results could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nClimate change can also pose a risk to our business due to related regulatory and legislative measures, requirements of our OEM customers or other strategic partners, and evolving societal pressures, including pressures to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act. U.S. Congress, in addition to other regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, could pass further legislation to mandate greenhouse gas emission reduction, implement cap-and-trade programs, or promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. Such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends, which could decrease the demand for certain of our products. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf climate change has impacts on natural disasters, the regulatory environment, or societal pressures as discussed above, it could result in a change in demand for certain products in markets that we serve, including auto, aviation, and marine. If we fail to adjust our product and service offerings to respond to new opportunities driven by changes in regulation and/or consumer preferences, it could have an adverse effect on our financial results. \n\n&#160; \n\nBecause it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. If such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline. As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development and information technology costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods. If revenues decrease and we continue to increase operating expenses, our operating results would be negatively affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nHistorically, our revenues have been lower in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. However, this can fluctuate based on the timing of new product launches. Sales of certain of our fitness, outdoor, marine, and auto products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season. Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nBecause we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. \n\n&#160; \n\nMany of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur large customers may also seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability through increased promotional programs or other measures, which could have a negative impact on our gross margin. Additionally, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. See Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on concentration of credit risk. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, evaluate, complete, and integrate such transactions. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe continually evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. \n\n&#160; \n\nAny past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management&#8217;s attention away from other business issues and opportunities. Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. Due diligence performed prior to closing acquisitions may not uncover certain risks or liabilities that could materially impact our business and financial results. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. We may not successfully integrate business, operational, and financial activities such as internal controls, Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance, cyber security measures, the GDPR and other corporate governance and regulatory matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future. If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\nMany of our products rely on the Global Positioning System and other Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS). \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense. The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. GPS satellites have a limited lifespan and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. The U.S. Space Force and Missile Systems Center continue to launch new satellites to replace retired and aged satellites. \n\n&#160; \n\nDespite ongoing efforts to repair, maintain and replace non-operational satellites, if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of GPS and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. Furthermore, as GPS satellites and ground control segment facilities are being modernized, software updates can cause problems. We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates. \n\n&#160; \n\nGPS is operated by the U.S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however, if the policy were to change, and commercial access to GPS was no longer supported by the U.S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nSome of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) and Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS). Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. \n\n&#160; \n\nSome of our products also use satellite signals from Russia&#8217;s GLONASS, the European Union Galileo system, and the Chinese BDS. National or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position. Use of non-U.S. GNSS signals may also be subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations. If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, it could result in lost revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism. \n\n&#160; \n\nActs of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Specifically, the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system. To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nA shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum; our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government&#8217;s GPS satellites. GPS operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations. These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference. Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. In the United States, the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur radar altimeter products for aircraft operate in a radio frequency band just above the C-band that has been allocated for 5G mobile wireless systems. There is a risk that 5G telecommunication systems operating in the vicinity of airports could cause harmful interference to radar altimeters resulting in inaccurate altimeter readings or complete altimeter failure. \n\n&#160; \n\nThis or any other ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and could have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Relating to Our Shares \n\nThe volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe market price of our shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During 2022, the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of $78.47 to a high of $136.71. A variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; \n\n&#8226; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates and global currency exchange rates; \n\n&#8226; announcements of technological innovations; \n\n&#8226; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; \n\n&#8226; developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; \n\n&#8226; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; \n\n&#8226; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; \n\n&#8226; changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates; \n\n&#8226; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; \n\n&#8226; announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; \n\n&#8226; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to Garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; \n\n&#8226; any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products; and \n\n&#8226; other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of January 24, 2023, members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with their respective immediate family members and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 20% of our outstanding shares. Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. \n\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd.&#8217;s articles of association. The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders&#8217; meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders&#8217; meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders&#8217; meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Switzerland withholding tax. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had CHF 4,279 million of unappropriated capital contribution reserves available from which the Company may make dividend payments. At the time this reserve balance has been returned to shareholders, a Swiss federal withholding tax of 35% will generally be applicable to dividends paid. \n\n&#160; \n\nWhen the capital contribution reserves are fully utilized, the Swiss federal withholding tax must be withheld from the gross dividend distribution and paid to the Swiss federal Tax Administration. A holder that qualifies for benefits under a double tax treaty may be able to recover partial withholding tax. For example, a U.S holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a dividend out of capital contribution reserves, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. If we are unable to pay a dividend out of capital contribution reserves, we will not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nThere is uncertainty as to our shareholders&#8217; ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. \n\n&#160; \n\n"

      "text": " Item 2.P roperties \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin and its subsidiaries own a majority of their principal properties and lease certain other properties. Depending on location, the properties could be used for manufacturing, warehousing, research and development, office space, or a combination of activities. Garmin&#8217;s principal properties are described below: \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin International, Inc. owns and occupies facilities of approximately 1,990,000 square feet on approximately 107 acres at 1200 East 151st Street, Olathe, Kansas, U.S. where the majority of product design and development work is conducted, the majority of aviation panel-mount products are manufactured, and products are warehoused and supported for North, Central and South America. The 1,990,000 square feet includes a 775,000 square foot manufacturing and distribution center. In connection with the bond financings for the facility in Olathe and the expansions of that facility, the City of Olathe holds the legal title to the Olathe facilities, which are leased to Garmin&#8217;s subsidiaries by the City. Upon the payment in full of the outstanding bonds, the City of Olathe is obligated to transfer title to Garmin&#8217;s subsidiaries for a nominal sum. Garmin International, Inc. has purchased all the outstanding bonds and expects to continue to hold the bonds until maturity in order to benefit from property tax abatement. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin International, Inc. leases 148,000 square feet of land at New Century Airport at 1 New Century Pkwy, Gardner, Kansas, U.S. under a ground lease and occupies two aircraft hangars on this land, one of which is owned (47,000 square feet) and the other leased (53,000 square feet). Both properties serve as flight test and certification facilities that are used in development and certification of aviation products. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin International, Inc. also owns approximately 367 acres of additional land in Olathe, Kansas that could accommodate future property development. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin AT, Inc. leases approximately 18 acres of land at 2345 Turner Road SE, Salem, Oregon, U.S. under a ground lease. The current term of this ground lease ends in 2030, but Garmin AT, Inc. has the option to extend the ground lease until 2050. Garmin AT, Inc. owns and occupies a 115,000 square foot facility for office and manufacturing use and a 33,000 square foot aircraft hangar that serves as a flight test and certification facility on this land. Garmin AT, Inc. also owns and occupies an additional 66,000 square foot facility on the same property for customer support and research and development activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin Corporation owns and occupies a 247,000 square foot facility at No. 68, Zhangshu 2nd Road, Xizhi Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan, a 185,000 square foot facility at No.97, Sec. 1, Xintai 5th Rd., Xizhi Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan, a 224,000 square foot facility at No. 24 Beiyuan Road, Jhongli, Tao-Yang County, Taiwan, a 576,000 square foot facility at No. 270 Huaya 2nd Road, LinKou, Tao-Yang County, Taiwan, and a 615,000 square foot facility at No. 3, Titanggang Rd., Xinshi Dist., Tainan City, Taiwan. Garmin China YangZhou Co., Ltd. leases a 204,000 square foot manufacturing facility at No. 122, Jinshan Road, Bali Town, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, People&#8217;s Republic of China. These facilities are used for the manufacturing and warehousing of most of Garmin&#8217;s fitness, outdoor, marine, and consumer auto products, as well as portable aviation products. These facilities are also used for research and development activities and marketing and support of products for Asia Pacific countries. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin (Europe) Ltd. owns and occupies a 155,000 square foot building located at Liberty House, Hounsdown Business Park, Southampton, U.K., and leases a 100,000 square foot facility at 4 Parham Dr, Boyatt Wood, Eastleigh, U.K., both used for warehousing, distribution, and office space. \n\n&#160; \n\nTacx B.V. owns and occupies a 291,000 square foot facility located at De Boeg 2, 2343 MA Oegstgeest, Netherlands.

      "text": " Item 7.Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes thereto), the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed above in Item 1A. \n\n&#160; \n\nThis section provides discussion and a year-to-year comparison for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. Discussion regarding our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 and a year-to-year comparison between the fiscal years ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs previously noted, the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future events. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;believes&#8221;, or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of our assumptions on which the statements are based prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such forward-looking statement. Except as may be required by law, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin&#8217;s fiscal year is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal year 2022 contained 53 weeks and fiscal years 2021 and 2020 contained 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company&#8217;s fiscal year and fiscal periods. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to &#34;we&#34;, &#34;us&#34;, &#34;our&#34; and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data. \n\n&#160; \n\nOverview \n\nThe Company is a leading worldwide provider of wireless devices, many of which feature Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation, and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle. During 2022, 2021, and 2020, Garmin was organized in the six operating segments of fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, consumer auto, and auto OEM. The Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), allocates resources and assesses performance of each operating segment individually. The fitness, outdoor, aviation, and marine operating segments represented reportable segments during 2022, 2021, and 2020. The consumer auto and auto OEM operating segments, which serve the auto market, did not meet the quantitative thresholds to separately qualify as reportable segments, and they are therefore reported together in an &#8220;all other&#8221; category captioned as auto. Fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, and auto are collectively referred to as our reported segments. \n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness Environment Update \n\n&#160; \n\nA number of headwinds including high inflation, rising interest rates, and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major currencies affected the economic environment and consumer behaviors in 2022. Additionally, while our global supply chain is routinely subject to component shortages, increased lead times, cost fluctuations, and logistics constraints, these factors have been further amplified by the current environment, including Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect certain of these challenges to persist into 2023. &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine has not had a material direct impact on our business, and our related direct exposure is limited, the nature and degree of the effects of that conflict, as well as the other effects of the current business environment over time remain uncertain. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Annual Report for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing our Company. \n\n&#160; \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nGeneral \n\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nGoodwill \n\n&#160; \n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units in proportion to the expected benefit from each business combination. Each of the Company&#8217;s operating segments represent a distinct reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the operating performance indicators, competition, or expectations about future market or economic conditions. \n\n&#160; \n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins, and terminal growth rates. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \n\nUnrecognized Income Tax Benefits \n\n&#160; \n\nWe recognize liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions, including those related to transfer pricing, based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be not required or it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\n&#160; \n\nAssessing uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment, including the evaluation of unique facts and circumstances and the interpretation of laws and regulations, especially the assessment of pricing analyses that may produce various ranges of outcomes. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounting Terms and Characteristics \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Sales \n\n&#160; \n\nOur net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network, installation and repair shops, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), our online webshop (garmin.com), subscriptions for connected services, and our own retail stores. Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive from our retail, dealer, and distributor customers. Certain arrangements with OEM customers are entered into at the beginning of an aircraft, boat, or vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill customer purchasing requirements for the entire production life, although there are generally no firm volume commitments, and sales are therefore generated on an order-by-order basis. As a result, we do not believe backlog information is material to the understanding of our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season. Our aviation and auto OEM products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications, regulatory mandates, auto program manufacturing, and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit \n\n&#160; \n\nRaw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold. Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower-cost or more readily available components. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe believe that our flexible production model allows our factories to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products. Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan and China than in other locations. \n\n&#160; \n\nShipping and handling costs associated with the transportation and delivery of our products are included in cost of goods sold. Such costs fluctuate due to a number of factors, including market pricing and the mix of modes of transportation we utilize. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales price variability, including that which is associated with foreign currency fluctuations, has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit. Our consolidated gross margin, representing gross profit as a percentage of net sales, is dependent on segment mix, and to a lesser extent, product mix within each segment. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdvertising Expense \n\n&#160; \n\nOur advertising expenses consist primarily of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; information systems and infrastructure costs; \n\n&#8226; salaries for sales, marketing and product support personnel; \n\n&#8226; salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel; \n\n&#8226; marketing, and other brand building costs; \n\n&#8226; finance and legal costs; \n\n&#8226; human resource costs; \n\n&#8226; travel and related costs; and \n\n&#8226; occupancy and other overhead costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and Development \n\n&#160; \n\nThe majority of our research and development costs represent engineering personnel costs, costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development, and outside product development costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new auto OEM programs and new markets for active lifestyle products. \n\n&#160; \n\nResults of Operations \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the Company refined the methodology used in classifying certain indirect costs as research and development expense, which we believe provides a more meaningful representation of costs incurred to support research and development activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses to the segments was refined to allocate these expenses in a more direct manner to provide the Company&#8217;s CODM with a more meaningful representation of segment profit or loss. The Company&#8217;s composition of operating segments and reportable segments did not change at that time. \n\n&#160; \n\nThese changes in classification and allocation had no effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated operating or net income. The amounts presented below for selling, general, and administrative expense, research and development expense, segment operating expense, and segment operating income for the 52-week periods ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n53-Weeks Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52-Weeks Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52-Weeks Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCost of goods sold \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGross profit \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOperating expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAdvertising \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSelling, general and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal operating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOther income (expense), net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nIncome before income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nProvision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nNet income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe table below sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five reported segments and supplemental information for the consumer auto and auto OEM operating segments that management believes is useful. The Company&#8217;s CODM uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss, combined with other measures, to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses. Net sales are directly attributed to each segment. Most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment, while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a reasonable manner considering the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated. For each line item in the table below, the total of the reported segments&#8217; amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;

\n\nNet sales decreased 2% in fiscal year 2022 when compared to the year-ago period primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major currencies. Total unit sales decreased approximately 9% to 15.0 million units in 2022 from 16.6 million units in 2021, which differs from the percent change in revenue primarily due to shifts in segment and product mix. Outdoor revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix at 31% in 2022, compared to Fitness at 31% in 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe increase in outdoor revenue was driven by sales growth across multiple product categories, led by adventure watches. Aviation revenue increased due to contributions from both aftermarket and OEM categories. The increase in marine revenue was driven by sales growth in multiple categories, led by strong demand for our sonar products. Fitness revenue decreased due to declines across all product categories. Auto revenue decreased as a sales decline in our consumer auto products more than offset the growth from auto OEM program model launches. \n\nGross Profit \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Gross Profit \n\n&#160; \n\n53-Weeks Ended December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear-over-Year Change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52-Weeks Ended December 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear-over-Year Change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52-Weeks Ended December 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nFitness \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n552,417 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(32 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n813,325 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n697,539 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOutdoor \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n969,810 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n834,837 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n739,777 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAviation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n573,063 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n519,821 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n453,008 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nMarine \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n491,457 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n495,310 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n384,450 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAuto \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n220,028 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n227,166 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n206,562 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nConsumer Auto \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n129,598 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(16 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n153,825 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n139,864 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAuto OEM \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n90,430 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n73,341 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n66,698 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,806,775 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,890,459 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,481,336 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nGross profit dollars in fiscal year 2022 decreased 3%, primarily due to the decrease in net sales compared to the year-ago period as described above.

The absolute dollar increase was primarily due to higher engineering personnel costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Operating Income (Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\n53-Weeks Ended December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear-over-Year Change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52-Weeks Ended December 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear-over-Year Change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52-Weeks Ended December 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nFitness \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n104,738 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(71 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n359,201 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n305,283 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOutdoor \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n556,448 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n476,122 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n438,197 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAviation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n213,186 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n193,188 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n146,608 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nMarine \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n215,304 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(14 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n249,781 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n177,184 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAuto \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(61,831 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(59,672 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(13,032 \n\n) \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nConsumer Auto \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n16,833 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(65 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n48,347 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n45,033 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAuto OEM \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(78,664 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(27 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(108,019 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(58,065 \n\n) \n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(28 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(42 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(31 \n\n%) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,027,845 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(16 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,218,620 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,054,240 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nTotal operating income decreased 16% in absolute dollars and 330 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to fiscal year 2021. The decrease as a percent of revenue was primarily due to higher operating expenses, while net sales declined, as described above. Decreases in operating income in fitness, marine, and consumer auto were partially offset by improved performance in outdoor, aviation and auto OEM. Auto OEM experienced an operating loss in fiscal year 2022 driven by investments in auto OEM programs, and we expect auto OEM to experience an operating loss in 2023. \n\nOther Income (Expense) \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Other Income (Expense) \n\n&#160; \n\n53-Weeks Ended December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52-Weeks Ended December 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52-Weeks Ended December 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n40,826 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,573 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37,002 \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency (losses) gains \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(11,274 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(45,263 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,825 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,577 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,866 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9,343 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37,129 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(11,824 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n49,170 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe average interest rate returns on cash and investments during the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2022 and 52-weeks ended December 25, 2021 were 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively. Interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on fixed-income securities. \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency gains and losses for the Company are driven by movements of a number of currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the Euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries, and the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. Other notable currency exposures include the Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Polish Zloty, and Swiss Franc. The majority of the Company&#8217;s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe $11.3 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Australian Dollar, Polish Zloty, Chinese Yuan, Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 6.4% against the Australian Dollar, 7.1% against the Polish Zloty, 8.5% against the Chinese Yuan, 5.4% against the Euro, 12.7% against the Japanese Yen, and 9.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $8.9 million, $6.0 million, $5.8 million, $5.1 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 9.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $28.0 million. The remaining net currency loss of $7.9 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe $45.3 million currency gain recognized in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro, Polish Zloty, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, and Australian Dollar, while the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Taiwan Dollar. During fiscal 2021, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 7.3% against the Euro, 9.6% against the Polish Zloty, 9.6% against the Japanese Yen, 3.0% against the Swiss Franc, and 4.7% against the Australian Dollar, resulting in losses of $20.0 million, $6.6 million, $2.6 million, $2.5 million, and $2.4 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.6% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $6.2 million. The remaining net currency loss of $5.0 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was $91.4 million compared to income tax expense of $124.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021, representing a net decrease of $33.2 million. The decrease was primarily due to income mix by jurisdiction and an increase in U.S. tax deductions and credits in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain Switzerland tax assets related to the October 2019 enactment of Switzerland federal and Schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures were revalued in the fourth quarter of 2022 resulting in $7.2 million income tax expense. In connection with these transitional measures included in Switzerland tax reform, a reduced income tax rate will be utilized on certain Switzerland taxable income for up to five years. Excluding the aforementioned $7.2 million income tax expense in fiscal 2022, income tax expense for fiscal year 2022 was $84.2 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn February 2020 the Company initiated a transaction between wholly-owned subsidiaries to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States, the primary location of research, development, and executive management. The migration, which includes a multi-year intercompany license of intellectual property, has resulted in a favorable shift of income mix by jurisdiction and a reduction in expense related to uncertain tax positions. The Company is pursuing an advance pricing agreement between relevant jurisdictions related to this transaction. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of the final advanced pricing agreement and related negotiations, which could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows for periods during negotiation and upon finalization. At the end of the license agreement, a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the United States. \n\n&#160; \n\nNumerous countries have signed the OECD global minimum tax initiative, including Switzerland, the U.S., and the U.K. Recently, Switzerland&#8217;s Federal Council proposed legislation which would implement a minimum tax of 15% in 2024. The passage of a minimum tax in Switzerland or other jurisdictions where we operate would result in an increase in the tax paid by the Company which could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income \n\n&#160; \n\nAs a result of the various factors noted above net income decreased 10% to $973.6 million from $1,082.2 million in the prior year. \n\n&#160; \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160; \n\nWe primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund share repurchases, and fund strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our short- and long-term projected working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management invests idle or surplus cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. The investment policy&#8217;s primary objectives are to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin&#8217;s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral, and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 4 for additional information regarding marketable securities. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $788.3 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $1,012.4 million for fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a higher use of cash on purchases of inventory, principally associated with the Company's strategy to optimize shipping methods and mitigate increased lead times for raw materials. Additionally, the Company used more cash for income taxes and operating expenses in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. These factors were partially offset by more timely cash collections of net sales in fiscal 2022 when compared to fiscal 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $145.1 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $475.4 million for fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to net redemptions of marketable securities in fiscal 2022 to fund financing activities described below, compared to the net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal 2021, as well as a decrease in purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash used in financing activities totaled $840.6 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $486.7 million for fiscal 2021. This increase was primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock under the share repurchase plan, and higher cash dividend payments in fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2022 included five dividend payments compared to four dividend payments in fiscal 2021 due to the timing of dividend dates and our fiscal period end dates, and our declared dividend increased from $0.61 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2020 to $0.67 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2021, and to $0.73 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2022. \n\nUses of Cash \n\nOperating Leases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain real estate properties, vehicles, and equipment. Leased properties are typically used for office space, distribution, and retail. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $161.3 million, with $30.7 million payable within 12 months. \n\nInventory Purchase Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company obtains various raw materials and components for its products from a variety of third party suppliers. The Company&#8217;s inventory purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had inventory purchase obligations of $760.0 million, with $520.7 million payable within 12 months. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $395.8 million, with $173.3 million payable within 12 months. \n\nOther Uses of Cash \n\n&#160; \n\nThe 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;2017 Act&#8221;) included provisions, which became effective during 2022 tax year, related to the capitalization of certain research and development costs for tax purposes. The provisions require us to capitalize certain research and development costs and amortize those capitalized costs on our U.S. tax returns over a period of five or fifteen years, depending on where the associated costs were incurred. While these provisions did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate, and we do not expect a material impact on our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate, this capitalization rule did increase our cash paid for taxes in fiscal 2022, and we expect it to continue to cause an increased level of cash paid for taxes in fiscal 2023. Cash paid for taxes will also increase in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to the payment of taxes in arrears related to the intercompany transaction to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States. \n\n&#160; \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nMarket Sensitivity \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services, the purchase of raw materials, and the cost of shipping and handling. We strive to offset pricing declines for certain products through obtaining reductions in raw materials costs and the introduction of new products. \n\n&#160; \n\nInflation \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business has at times been impacted by increasing costs. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \n\n&#160; \n\nThe operation of Garmin&#8217;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant impacts to our financial results due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. Dollar. The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The Company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks with financial instruments. \n\nThe currencies that have historically created a majority of the Company&#8217;s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar and Euro. Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Xizhi, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year&#8208;end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at rates prevailing during the year. In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary&#8217;s cash and investments denominated in U.S. Dollars. \n\n&#160; \n\nMost European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency. The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. is the U.S. Dollar, and as some transactions occur in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company incurred a net foreign currency loss of $11.3 million. The U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Australian Dollar, Polish Zloty, Chinese Yuan, Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar. During fiscal 2022, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 6.4% against the Australian Dollar, 7.1% against the Polish Zloty, 8.5% against the Chinese Yuan, 5.4% against the Euro, 12.7% against the Japanese Yen, and 9.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $8.9 million, $6.0 million, $5.8 million, $5.1 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 9.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $28.0 million. The remaining net currency loss of $7.9 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial. These and other currency moves during fiscal year 2022 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of $149.4 million within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). \n\n&#160; \n\nWe assessed the Company&#8217;s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, Polish Zloty, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, and Australian Dollar would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $81 million and $68 million, respectively. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2022. We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe primary objectives of the Company&#8217;s investment policy are to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. The Company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company had not recognized an allowance for credit losses on any securities in an unrealized loss position. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe assessed the Company&#8217;s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the Company&#8217;s portfolio of marketable securities. Based on balance sheet positions as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $31 million and $40 million at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. \n\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\n&#160; \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\n&#160; \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\n&#160; \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\n&#160; \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\n&#160; \n\nValuation of Goodwill \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Description of the Matter \n\nThe Company assigns goodwill acquired in business combinations to its reporting units as of each acquisition date. At December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s goodwill balance related to the consumer auto reporting unit was approximately $77 million. As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. Revenue and profits of the consumer auto reporting unit declined for a number of years through fiscal 2020 as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred for certain key products. Revenue and profit of the consumer auto reporting unit has since experienced periods of increases and decreases. Considering uncertainty in qualitative factors, management performed a step one quantitative impairment test of the consumer auto reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\n##TABLE_END 45 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAuditing management&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment test for the consumer auto reporting unit was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins, and terminal growth rates which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. \n\n&#160; \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s consumer auto goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant assumptions (e.g., discount rate, projected revenue growth rates, projected operating margins, terminal growth rates) used to develop the prospective financial information (PFI) for the quantitative analysis. We also tested management's controls to validate that the data used in the valuation was complete and accurate. \n\n&#160; \n\nTo test the estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s consumer auto reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodology and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We included valuation specialists on our team to review the Company&#8217;s model, method, and the more sensitive assumptions such as the discount rate and terminal growth assumptions. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Company&#8217;s business model, forecasts used in the Company&#8217;s annual operating plans and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management&#8217;s forecast estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the consumer auto reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We reconciled the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, testing the Company&#8217;s determination of the assets and liabilities used within the reporting unit that are the basis for the carrying value. In addition, we tested management&#8217;s reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. \n\n##TABLE_END 46 \n\n&#160; \n\nMeasurement of Reserve for Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Description of the Matter \n\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . The Company operates in a multinational tax environment and is subject to tax laws, regulations and guidelines for intercompany transactions that have transfer pricing subjectivity. The Company uses significant judgment to evaluate uncertain tax positions and determine whether the threshold for recognition has been met and to measure the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s balance of gross unrecognized income tax benefits was $31 million at December 31, 2022, primarily related to transfer pricing positions. \n\n&#160; \n\nAuditing management&#8217;s assessment and measurement of material tax positions is complex and involved especially subjective and complex judgements. The assessment process involves both significant judgment to evaluate each position against the recognition threshold and estimation because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on pricing analyses that may produce a number of different outcomes or ranges of outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm&#8217;s-length transaction). Each transfer pricing tax position carries unique facts and circumstances that must be evaluated, and ultimate resolution will be dependent on uncontrollable factors, such as the interpretation of laws and regulations; new case law; the willingness of the income tax authority to settle the issue, including the timing thereof; and other factors. \n\n&#160; \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the identification, assessment, measurement and valuation of uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing from intercompany transactions. For example, we tested controls over management&#8217;s review of intercompany transfer pricing positions against the measurement criteria, review of inputs and calculations of these uncertain tax positions, which included management&#8217;s evaluation of the ranges of outcomes and pricing conclusions reached within the transfer pricing studies. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, involving our tax professionals to test the Company&#8217;s assessment and measurement of tax positions related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions to assess the appropriateness of the ranges of outcomes utilized and the pricing conclusions reached within the transfer pricing studies conducted by the Company. For example, we compared the transfer pricing methodology utilized by management to alternative methodologies and industry benchmarks. We also verified our understanding of the relevant facts by reading the Company&#8217;s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and any third-party advice obtained by the Company. In addition, we used our knowledge of international and local income tax laws, as well as historical settlement activity from income tax authorities, to evaluate the appropriateness of the Company&#8217;s measurement of uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing used in these intercompany transactions. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\n&#160; \n\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation \n\nGarmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Garmin&#8221;) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based, portable, and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and sensor-based products and services. Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company&#8217;s products to the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products in Asia and the Far East. Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company&#8217;s research and new product development. GII also manufactures most of the Company&#8217;s products in the aviation segment. Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Many of GEL&#8217;s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \n\n&#160; \n\nChanges in Classification and Allocation \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified or presented to conform to current period presentation. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company refined the methodology used in classifying certain indirect costs in accordance with the way the Company's management is now using the information in decision making, which management believes provides a more meaningful representation of costs incurred to support research and development activities. As a result, the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income have been recast for the 52-week periods ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 to reflect a reclassification of $ 61,274 and $ 53,343 , respectively, from research and development expense to selling, general, and administrative expense. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses to the segments was refined to allocate these expenses in a more direct manner to provide the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) with a more meaningful representation of segment profit or loss. The Company&#8217;s composition of operating segments and reportable segments did not change at that time. Results for the 52-week periods ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 have been recast to conform to current period presentation. \n\n&#160; \n\nThese changes in classification and allocation had no effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated operating or net income. \n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal Year \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is based on a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs. \n\nIn those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial results of those 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarters, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated 13-week quarters. Fiscal year 2022 contains 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks for 2021 and 2020 . \n\n&#160; \n\nUse of Estimates \n\n&#160; \n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Currency \n\n&#160; \n\nMany Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency. As required by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters , the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity. Cumulative currency translation adjustments of $ ( 25,981 ) and $ 123,415 as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \n\n&#160; \n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The majority of the Company&#8217;s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. Net foreign currency losses recorded in results of operations were $ 11,274 for the year ended December 31, 2022, net foreign currency losses recorded in results of operations were $ 45,263 for the year ended December 25, 2021, and net foreign currency gains recorded in results of operations were $ 2,825 for the year ended December 26, 2020. The loss in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Australian Dollar, Polish Zloty, Chinese Yuan, Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar. The loss in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro, Polish Zloty, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, and Australian Dollar, while the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Taiwan Dollar. The gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro, Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar. \n\n&#160; \n\nGarmin Corporation, one of the Company&#8217;s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan. The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute (the &#8220;Statute&#8221;), and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions, so the Statute does not impose any significant restrictions on import or export activities involving foreign currencies in Taiwan. Non-trade related currency exchanges exceeding $50 million, or its equivalent, in a calendar year require approval of the CBC. \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customer in an amount that depicts the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled for the related products or services. For the large majority of the Company&#8217;s sales, transfer of control occurs once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. The Company offers certain tangible products with ongoing services promised over a period of time, typically the useful life of the related tangible product. When such services have been identified as both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable from the related tangible product, the associated revenue allocated to such services is recognized over time. The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company allocates revenue to all performance obligations associated with tangible products containing separately identifiable ongoing services based on the respective performance obligations&#8217; relative standalone selling prices (&#8220;SSP&#8221;), with the amounts allocated to ongoing services deferred and recognized over a period of time. These ongoing services primarily consist of the Company&#8217;s contractual promises to provide personal navigation device (PND) users with map updates and server-based traffic services. In addition, the Company provides map update services (map care) over a contractual period in certain hardware and software contracts with automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The Company has determined that directly observable prices do not exist for certain map updates, map care, or server-based traffic, as stand-alone and unbundled unit sales do not occur on more than a limited basis. Therefore, the Company uses the expected cost plus a margin as the primary indicator to calculate relative SSP of certain map updates, map care, and traffic performance obligations. The revenue and associated costs allocated to map updates, map care, and server-based traffic service are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated life of the products. In addition to the products listed above, the Company has offered certain other products with ongoing performance obligations including aviation database and other service subscriptions, incremental navigation and communication service subscriptions, mobile applications, and extended warranties that are recognized over the contractual service period (typically 1 - 3 years ). \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company records revenue net of sales tax or value-added tax and variable consideration such as trade discounts and customer returns. Payment is due typically within 90 days or less of shipment of product, or upon the grant of a given software license (as applicable). The Company records estimated reductions to revenue in the form of variable consideration for customer sales programs, returns, and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection, promotions, and other volume-based incentives. Cooperative advertising incentives payable to dealers and distributors are recorded as reductions of revenue unless the Company obtains proof of a distinct advertising service, in which case the incentive is recorded as advertising expense. The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions. \n\nShipping and Handling Costs \n\nShipping and handling activities are typically performed before the customer obtains control of the good, and the related costs are expensed at the approximate time of sale. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. \n\nAdvertising Costs \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $ 168,040 , $ 171,829 , and $ 151,166 for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 , respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nSoftware Development Costs \n\n&#160; \n\nASC Topic 985-20, Software &#8211; Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed , requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. The Company&#8217;s capitalized software development costs are not significant, as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short. As required by ASC Topic 730, Research and Development , costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounting for Stock Compensation \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company currently sponsors three employee stock compensation plans. ASC Topic 718, Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation , requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and restricted stock, based on estimated fair values. \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock compensation expense over the requisite service period in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs stock compensation expense recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management&#8217;s estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nExcess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock compensation are recognized in the income tax provision and are not estimated in the effective tax rate. Rather, they are recorded as discrete tax items in the period they occur. Excess income tax benefits from stock compensation arrangements are classified as a cash flow from operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nStock compensation plans are discussed in more detail in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nA majority of the Company&#8217;s research and development is performed in the United States. Research and development costs, which are typically expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $ 834,927 , $ 778,750 , and $ 652,342 for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 , respectively. \n\nPreproduction Costs Related to Long-Term Supply Arrangements \n\nPreproduction design and development costs related to long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred, and classified as research and development, unless the customer has provided a contractual guarantee for reimbursement of such costs. Contractually reimbursable costs are capitalized as incurred in the consolidated balance sheets within prepaid expenses and other current assets if reimbursement is expected to be received within one year, or within other noncurrent assets if expected to be received beyond one year. Such capitalized costs were approximately $ 23,510 and $ 67,349 as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 , respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. The Company recognizes liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities results in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the Company&#8217;s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings Per Share \n\n&#160; \n\nBasic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive share-based compensation awards has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise or release at the average market price of the Company&#8217;s stock during the period the awards were outstanding. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash \n\n&#160; \n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments. Restricted cash is reported within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restricted cash. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe total of the cash and cash equivalents balance and the restricted cash reported within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets reconciles to the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketable Securities \n\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. \n\n&#160; \n\nAll of the Company&#8217;s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 31, 2022. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, cumulative unrealized losses of $ 88,552 and $ 5,580 , respectively were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company recognizes impairments relating to credit losses of available-for-sale securities through an allowance for credit losses and other income (expense) on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income. Impairment not relating to credit losses is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. \n\n&#160; \n\nTesting for impairment of investments requires management judgment. The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value, and the assessment of whether any decline in value is relating to credit losses are the judgmental elements. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can change these judgments. Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time. The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn making this assessment we evaluate the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, any change in credit rating of the security, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, and other relevant factors affecting the security. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, the amount of the credit loss is determined by comparing the present value of the expected future cash flows for the security to the amortized cost basis of the security, limited by the amount the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization and realized gains/losses are recorded within interest income and other income (expense), respectively, on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income.

Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers. The Company's trade accounts receivable are carried at net realizable value, typically are collected within 90 days, and do not bear interest. Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice. Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company. Credit losses are provided for in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management&#8217;s expectations. Past due receivable balances are typically written off when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide some security against certain losses within policy limits. \n\n&#160;\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s top ten customers have contributed between 20 % and 23 % of net sales annually since 2020 . None of the Company's customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 26, 2020. Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates (Amazon), a customer of the fitness, outdoor, marine, and consumer auto segments, was our largest customer and accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021 . No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Garmin's consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nInventories \n\n&#160; \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead associated with purchases and production and is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Inventories consisted of the following: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\nRaw materials \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n600,858 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n509,435 \n\n&#160; \n\nWork-in-process \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n180,873 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n213,801 \n\n&#160; \n\nFinished goods \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n733,314 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n504,373 \n\n&#160; \n\nInventories \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,515,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,227,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred Revenues and Costs \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $ 126,794 and $ 129,272 , respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $ 24,693 and $ 28,322 , respectively. \n\nDeferred revenue consists primarily of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are recognized over a period of time basis as discussed in the Revenue Recognition portion of this footnote. Billings associated with such items are typically completed upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customer and recorded to accounts receivable until payment is received. Deferred costs primarily refer to the license fees incurred by the Company associated with the aforementioned unsatisfied performance obligations, which are amortized over the same period as the revenue is recognized. The Company typically pays the associated license fees either monthly or quarterly in arrears, on a per item shipped or installed basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company applies a practical expedient, as permitted within ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs , to expense as incurred the incremental costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period of the asset that would have otherwise been recognized is one year or less. \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty and Equipment \n\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and typically depreciated using the straight-line method. The components of property and equipment were as follows and are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEstimated Useful Life \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\nLand \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n193,861 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n206,895 \n\n&#160; \n\nBuilding and improvements \n\n&#160; \n\n15 to 50 years \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n856,722 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n763,654 \n\n&#160; \n\nMachinery, equipment and software \n\n&#160; \n\n3 to 10 years \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,001,344 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n917,557 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal, at cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,051,927 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,888,106 \n\n&#160; \n\nAccumulated depreciation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 904,922 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 820,628 \n\n) \n\nProperty and equipment, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,147,005 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,067,478 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nAs required by ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment , the Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company did not recognize any material long-lived asset impairment charges in the fiscal years of 2022, 2021, or 2020 . \n\n&#160; \n\nIntangible Assets \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, the Company had intellectual property, customer related intangibles, and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $ 511,716 and $ 524,566 , respectively. Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis typically over three to ten years . Accumulated amortization was $ 333,256 and $ 308,572 at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $ 30,561 , $ 35,540 , and $ 34,797 for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, respectively. In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $ 29,786 , $ 26,644 , $ 23,682 , $ 20,552 , and $ 16,527 , respectively. The Company also reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, as described above, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $ 567,994 at December 31, 2022, and $ 575,080 at December 25, 2021.

The Company performs its annual impairment assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, if any, in the fourth quarter of each year, as of the Company&#8217;s fiscal year end date. \n\n&#160; \n\nASC Topic 350 allows management to first perform a qualitative goodwill assessment by assessing the qualitative factors of relevant events and circumstances at the reporting unit level to determine if it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the quantitative test will be performed. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized in the amount by which carrying amount exceeds fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Each of the Company&#8217;s operating segments (fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, consumer auto, and auto OEM) represents a distinct reporting unit, and goodwill impairment assessments are therefore performed at that level. \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenue and profits of the consumer auto reporting unit declined for a number of years through fiscal 2020, as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred for certain key products. Revenue and profit of the consumer auto reporting unit has since experienced periods of increases and decreases and, considering uncertainty in qualitative factors, management performed a quantitative impairment test of the consumer auto reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2022. Consistent with the results of the quantitative assessment performed in 2021, the quantitative assessment indicated again in 2022 that the fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement also concluded that no goodwill associated with other reporting units is currently at risk of impairment based on qualitative assessments performed in 2022. The Company did not recognize any material goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal years 2022, 2021, or 2020 . \n\n&#160; \n\nLeases \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company leases certain real estate properties, vehicles, and equipment in various countries around the world. Leased properties are typically used for office space, distribution, and retail. The Company&#8217;s leases are classified as operating leases with remaining terms of 1 to 31 year s, some of which include an option to extend or renew. If the exercise of an option to extend or renew is determined to be reasonably certain, the associated right-of-use asset and lease liability reflects the extended period and payments. For newly signed leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognized on lease commencement date. Variable lease costs, such as adjustments to payments based on consumer price indices, are excluded in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. For all real estate leases, any non-lease components, including common area maintenance, have been separated from lease components and excluded from the associated right-of-use asset and lease liability calculations. For all equipment and vehicle leases, an accounting policy election has been made to not separate lease and non-lease components. \n\n&#160; \n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less (&#8220;short-term leases&#8221;) are not recognized on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets as a right-of-use asset or lease liability. \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct Warranty \n\nThe Company accrues for estimated future warranty costs at the time products are sold. The Company&#8217;s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged, or is defective. The Company&#8217;s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale. The Company&#8217;s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation, marine, and auto OEM products have a warranty period of two years or more from the date of installation. The Company&#8217;s estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and management&#8217;s expectations and judgments of future conditions. To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, which may result in decreased gross profit. The following reconciliation presents details of the changes in the Company&#8217;s accrued warranty costs: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nBalance - beginning of period \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n45,467 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n42,643 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n39,758 \n\n&#160; \n\nAccrual for products sold (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n72,821 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n69,810 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n67,028 \n\n&#160; \n\nExpenditures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 67,336 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 66,986 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 64,143 \n\n) \n\nBalance - end of period \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n50,952 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n45,467 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n42,643 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n(1) Changes in cost estimates related to pre-existing warranties were not material and aggregated with accruals for new warranty contracts in the &#8216;accrual for products sold&#8217; line. \n\n&#160; \n\nContingencies \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations and complaints, including matters alleging patent infringement and other intellectual property claims. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly and annual basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations, claims, and other loss contingencies that could affect any required accrual or disclosure or estimate of reasonably possible loss or range of loss. An estimated loss from a loss contingency is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a range of loss is estimated, and some amount within that range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within that range, then that amount is accrued. If no amount within the range can be identified as a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues the minimum amount in the range. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf an outcome unfavorable to the Company is determined to be probable, but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated or is determined to be reasonably possible, but not probable, we disclose the nature of the contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company&#8217;s aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1) matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability, and (2) matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, and a liability therefore has not been accrued. This aggregate range only represents the Company&#8217;s estimate of reasonably possible losses and does not represent the Company&#8217;s maximum loss exposure. The assessment regarding whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. In assessing the probability of an outcome in a lawsuit, claim or assessment that could be unfavorable to the Company, we consider the following factors, among others: a) the nature of the litigation, claim, or assessment; b) the progress of the case; c) the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers; d) our experience in similar cases; e) the experience of other entities in similar cases; and f) how we intend to respond to the lawsuit, claim, or assessment. Costs incurred in defending lawsuits, claims or assessments are expensed as incurred. \n\n&#160; \n\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on contingencies. \n\n&#160; \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (&#8220;ASU 2016-13&#8221;). ASU 2016-13 changed how entities assess and measure credit losses of certain financial instruments, including available-for-sale securities and accounts receivable. The Company adopted the new standard as of the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year. The adoption of the standard did no t have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nReceivables &#8211; Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs \n\n&#160; \n\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-08, Receivables &#8211; Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Topic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities (&#8220;ASU 2017-08&#8221;), which shortened the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium, requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The Company adopted the new standard as of the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year.

Revenue \n\nIn order to further depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors, we disaggregate revenue (or &#8220;net sales&#8221;) by geographic region, major product category, and pattern of recognition. \n\nDisaggregated revenue by geographic region (Americas, APAC, and EMEA) is presented in Note 11 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data. Note 11 also contains disaggregated revenue information of the six major product categories identified by the Company &#8211; fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, consumer auto, and auto OEM. \n\nA large majority of the Company&#8217;s sales are recognized on a point in time basis, usually once the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over a period of time are primarily within the outdoor, aviation, and auto segments and relate to performance obligations that are satisfied over the estimated life of the product or contractual service period. Revenue disaggregated by the timing of transfer of the goods or services is presented in the table below: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nPoint in time \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,602,636 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,762,260 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,998,251 \n\n&#160; \n\nOver time \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n257,650 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n220,535 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n188,322 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,860,286 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,982,795 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,186,573 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nTransaction price and costs associated with the Company&#8217;s unsatisfied performance obligations are reflected as deferred revenue and deferred costs, respectively, on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets.

Marketable Securities \n\n&#160; \n\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Level 1 \n\nUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets for the identical asset or liability \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\nObservable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 3 \n\nUnobservable inputs for the asset or liability \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation is based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads. \n\nThe method described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAvailable-For-Sale Securities as of December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFair Value Level \n\n&#160; \n\nAmortized Cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGross Unrealized Gains \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGross Unrealized Losses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFair Value \n\n&#160; \n\nAgency securities \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 786 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,214 \n\n&#160; \n\nMortgage-backed securities \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n45,373 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 4,525 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n40,848 \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate debt securities \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,106,688 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 77,802 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,029,074 \n\n&#160; \n\nMunicipal securities \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n326,058 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 28,861 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n297,200 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n10,466 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 2,154 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,312 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,495,585 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 114,128 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,381,648 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAvailable-For-Sale Securities as of December 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFair Value Level \n\n&#160; \n\nAmortized Cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGross Unrealized Gains \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGross Unrealized Losses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFair Value \n\n&#160; \n\nAgency securities \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 110 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,890 \n\n&#160; \n\nMortgage-backed securities \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n149,692 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 880 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n149,069 \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate debt securities \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,079,390 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9,830 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 11,827 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,077,393 \n\n&#160; \n\nMunicipal securities \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n356,037 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,870 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 4,864 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n353,043 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n31,134 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 873 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n30,283 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,623,253 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,979 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 18,554 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,616,678 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nThe primary objectives of the Company&#8217;s investment policy are to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.

No accrued interest was written off during the 53-week period ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company recognizes impairments relating to credit losses of available-for-sale securities through an allowance for credit losses and other income (expense) on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income.

\n\nThe Company has no t recorded an allowance for credit losses and charge to other income for the unrealized losses on agency, mortgage-backed, corporate debt, municipal, and other securities presented above because we do not consider the declines in fair value to have resulted from credit losses. We have not observed a significant deterioration in credit quality of these securities, which are highly rated with moderate to low credit risk. Declines in value are largely attributable to current global economic conditions. The securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments, and the fair values are expected to recover as they approach maturity. The Company does not intend to sell the securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities, before the respective recoveries of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at December 31, 2022, by maturity, are shown below. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmortized Cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFair Value \n\n&#160; \n\nDue in one year or less \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n175,644 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n173,288 \n\n&#160; \n\nDue after one year through five years \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,303,653 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,194,280 \n\n&#160; \n\nDue after five years through ten years \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14,041 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12,382 \n\n&#160; \n\nDue after ten years \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,247 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,698 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,495,585 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,381,648 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\n5.

The Company recorded income tax expense of $ 124,596 in the year ended December 25, 2021 . The Company recorded income tax expense of $ 111,086 in the year ended December 26, 2020 , which included a $ 14,308 income tax benefit recognized by the Company in the second quarter of 2020 due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with a 2014 intercompany restructuring and was partially offset by income tax expense of $ 11,016 recognized by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the revaluation of certain Switzerland tax assets related to the Switzerland tax reform transitional measures. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s statutory federal and cantonal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation, was approximately 14 % in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020. If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax expense for 2022 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $ 77,000 lower, or $ 147,000 , and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $ 33,000 . For 2021 , the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $ 84,000 lower, or $ 169,000 , and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $ 28,000 . For 2020 , the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $ 77,000 lower, or $ 155,000 , and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $ 20,000 . All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $ 1,287,794 , $ 1,227,666 , and $ 1,059,074 , for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome taxes of $ 45,459 , $ 50,127 , and $ 47,236 at December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely. \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred tax assets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct warranty accruals \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,111 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,578 \n\n&#160; \n\nAccrued vacation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14,986 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14,073 \n\n&#160; \n\nShare-based compensation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,667 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12,000 \n\n&#160; \n\nTax credit carryforwards \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n19,950 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24,508 \n\n&#160; \n\nIntangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n156,702 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n173,468 \n\n&#160; \n\nCapitalized research &#38; development expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n231,429 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n53,827 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet operating losses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,955 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9,069 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n30,310 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n13,685 \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18,327 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n20,970 \n\n&#160; \n\nTax basis in excess of book basis for investments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27,227 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,321 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18,259 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n20,220 \n\n&#160; \n\nValuation allowance related to loss carryforward and tax credits \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 17,077 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 19,709 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n525,846 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n337,010 \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred tax liabilities: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFixed assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n40,526 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27,970 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n29,756 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n13,322 \n\n&#160; \n\nPrepaid and perpetual license assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11,798 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n17,350 \n\n&#160; \n\nBook basis in excess of tax basis for acquired entities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n21,970 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n32,907 \n\n&#160; \n\nWithholding tax \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n108,692 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n89,285 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,998 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n13,566 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n214,740 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n194,400 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet deferred tax assets \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n311,106 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n142,610 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred tax assets related to capitalized research and development expenses increased as of December 31, 2022 as compared to December 25, 2021 by $ 177,602 , primarily related to the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included provisions that became effective during 2022 tax year that require us to capitalize certain research and development costs and amortize those capitalized costs on our U.S. tax returns over a period of five or fifteen years, depending on where the associated costs were incurred. \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2022 , the Company had $ 19,950 of tax credit carryover compared to $ 24,508 at December 25, 2021. At December 31, 2022 , the Company had a deferred tax asset of $ 4,955 related to the future tax benefit of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $ 16,296 . Included in the NOL carryforwards is $ 10,530 that relates to Luxembourg and expires beginning in 2037 , $ 707 that relates to Finland and expires in varying amounts between 2025 and 2029 , $ 575 that relates to the Netherlands and expires in 2026 , $ 39 that relates to Thailand and expires in 2025 , and $ 4,445 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized. In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, as of December 31, 2022 was $ 30,795 . A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 25, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nBalance beginning of year \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n65,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n84,985 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n101,251 \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior years \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n10,480 \n\n&#160; \n\nReductions based on tax positions related to prior years \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 6,363 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 4,727 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 4,169 \n\n) \n\nAdditions based on tax positions related to current period \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,368 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,272 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n16,859 \n\n&#160; \n\nReductions related to settlements with tax authorities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 15,476 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 935 \n\n) \n\nExpiration of statute of limitations \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 14,950 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 19,314 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 38,501 \n\n) \n\nBalance at end of year \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,795 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n65,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n84,985 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as noncurrent liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date. The balance of net unrecognized benefits of $ 29,159 , $ 54,443 , and $ 81,938 are required to be classified as noncurrent at December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, respectively. The net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense. At December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 , the Company had accrued approximately $ 2,751 , $ 4,225 , and $ 5,666 , respectively, for interest. The interest component of the reserve decreased income tax expense for the years ending December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 by $ 1,474 , and $ 1,441 , and $ 1,970 , respectively. The Company did no t have significant amounts accrued for penalties for the years ending December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company files income tax returns in Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various states, local, and foreign jurisdictions. In its major tax jurisdictions, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and U.S. federal and various states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities, with few exceptions, for years prior to 2018, 2017, 2020, and 2019, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense, inclusive of interest and net of deferrals, of $ 12,749 , $ 22,221 , and $ 42,185 in fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement in various jurisdictions. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $ 5,000 to $ 15,000 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations. This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate within the next 12 months. \n\n&#160; \n\n6.

The Company&#8217;s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for inventory, capital expenditures, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting the business. The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 31, 2022 that may represent noncancellable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year was approximately $ 383,000 . \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain cash balances are held as collateral in relation to bank guarantees. The total amount of restricted cash was $ 718 and $ 785 on December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nContingencies \n\nManagement of the Company currently does not believe it is reasonably possible that the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies in the aggregate, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The results of legal proceedings, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse resolution of one or more of such matters in excess of management&#8217;s expectations could have a material adverse effect in the particular quarter or fiscal year in which a loss is recorded, but based on information currently known, the Company does not believe it is likely that losses from such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company settled or resolved certain legal matters during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\n8.

Employee Stock Compensation and Savings Plans \n\n&#160; \n\nStock Compensation \n\n&#160; \n\nThe various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below. For all stock compensation plans, the company&#8217;s policy is to issue treasury shares for option/stock appreciation right (SAR) exercises, restricted stock unit (RSU) releases, and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) purchases. \n\n&#160; \n\n2011 Non-employee Directors&#8217; Equity Incentive Plan \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2011, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the &#8220;2011 Directors Plan&#8221;) providing for grants of stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to 122,592 shares were made available for issuance. The term of each award cannot exceed ten years . Awards are subject to a minimum one-year vesting period. In 2022, 2021, and 2020 , there were 6,008 , 4,180 , and 6,376 RSUs granted under this plan, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\n2005 Equity Incentive Plan \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2005, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the &#8220;2005 Plan&#8221;) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 10,000,000 common shares were made available for issuance. In 2013, the shareholders approved an additional 3,000,000 shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan 13,000,000 . Option and SAR grants vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised. RSUs vest evenly over a period of three years . In addition to time-based vesting requirements, the vesting of certain RSU grants is also contingent upon the Company&#8217;s achievement of certain financial performance goals. During 2022, 2021, and 2020 , there were 1,185,707 , 866,614 , and 753,976 RSUs granted under the 2005 Plan, respectively. No stock options or SARs were granted under the 2005 Plan in 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\n2000 Equity Incentive Plan \n\n&#160; \n\nIn October 2000, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the &#8220;2000 Plan&#8221;) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, SARs, restricted shares and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 7,000,000 common shares were made available for issuance. The stock options and SARs vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if no t exercised. The Company did not grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2022, 2021, or 2020.

The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs exercised during 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $ 0 , $ 1,040 , and $ 3,701 , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $ 169,498 . The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $ 74,278 , $ 118,825 , and $ 109,952 , respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of options and SARs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the positive difference between the exercise price and the Company&#8217;s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period. Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the Company&#8217;s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period. The Company&#8217;s closing stock price was $ 92.29 on December 31, 2022 (based on the closing stock price on December 30, 2022). As of December 31, 2022 , there was $ 95,019 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period. \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan \n\nThe shareholders have adopted an ESPP. Up to 8,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP. Shares are offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85 % of the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of purchase or 85 % of the fair market value on the first day of the ESPP period. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an &#8220;employee stock purchase plan&#8221; under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2022, 2021, and 2020 , there were 687,370 , 385,211 , and 195,540 shares purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $ 62,154 , $ 34,936 , and $ 15,955 , respectively. During 2022, 2021, and 2020, the purchases were issued from treasury shares. At December 31, 2022 , approximately 787,534 shares were available for future issuance. \n\nSavings Plans \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company sponsor various defined contribution employee retirement plans. GII and the Company&#8217;s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a plan under which their employees may contribute up to 50 % of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant&#8217;s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan. During the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 , expense related to this and other defined contribution plans of $ 80,435 , $ 71,262 , and $ 63,908 , respectively, was recorded within the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income. \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor or participate in local defined benefit pension plans. The obligations, contributions, and associated expense of such plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020 were not material. \n\n11. Segment Information and Geographic Data \n\nDuring 2022, 2021, and 2020, Garmin was organized in the six operating segments of fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, consumer auto, and auto OEM. Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by the CODM, who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually. The fitness, outdoor, aviation, and marine operating segments represented reportable segments during 2022, 2021, and 2020. The consumer auto and auto OEM operating segments, which serve the auto market, did not meet the quantitative thresholds to separately qualify as reportable segments, and they are therefore reported together in an &#8220;all other&#8221; category captioned as auto. Fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, and auto are collectively referred to as our reported segments. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the CODM, uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss, combined with other measures, to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses. Net sales are directly attributed to each segment. Most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment, while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a reasonable manner considering the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or transfers. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business. Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM. \n\nAs indicated in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses to the segments was refined to allocate these expenses in a more direct manner to provide the Company&#8217;s CODM with a more meaningful representation of segment profit or loss. The Company&#8217;s composition of operating segments and reportable segments did not change at that time. Results for the 52-week periods ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 have been recast below to conform with the current period presentation. \n\nNet sales (&#8220;revenue&#8221;), gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company&#8217;s five reported segments are presented below, along with supplemental financial information for the consumer auto and auto OEM operating segments that management believes is useful. \n\n&#160;

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in &#8220;Internal Control-Integrated Framework&#8221; (2013 framework). \n\n&#160; \n\nBased on such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nErnst &#38; Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on management&#8217;s effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report which is included herein. That attestation report appears below. \n\n(c)Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\n&#160; \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries \n\n&#160; \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have audited Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries&#8217; internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\n&#160; \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\n&#160; \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n&#160; \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n&#160; \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nKansas City, Missouri \n\nFebruary 22, 2023 \n\n&#160; \n\n(d)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n&#160; \n\n"
