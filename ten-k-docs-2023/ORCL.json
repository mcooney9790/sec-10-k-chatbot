Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise deployments, cloud-based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployment) such as our Oracle Cloud&#64;Customer offering (an instance of Oracle Cloud in a customer&#8217;s own data center). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers&#8217; needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations including, for example, a global cloud applications developer that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to power its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings&#59; a multi-national financial institution that runs its banking applications using the Oracle Exadata Database Machine&#59; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning for its accounting processes, consolidation and financial planning functions.\n\nOracle Cloud Services offerings, which include Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings, provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services delivered via cloud-based deployment models. Oracle Cloud Services integrate the IT components, including software, hardware and services, on a customer&#8217;s behalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for the customer and that a customer may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices. \n\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation&#59; intuitive for casual and experienced users&#59; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work&#59; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between IT environments&#59; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments&#59; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment&#59; and secure, standards-based and reliable. \n\nOracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license. \n\nOracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products. \n\nOracle also offers services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases. \n\nProviding choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer&#8217;s transition to cloud-based IT environments.\n\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we invested $7.2 billion, $6.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another including through the use of OCI to power our Oracle Fusion SaaS Applications, which we and our customers use to run internal business processes. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nrelative to our competitors&#59; facilitating the ease with which organizations are able to deploy, use, manage and maintain our offerings&#59; and incorporating emerging technologies within our offerings to enable leaner business processes, automation and innovation. For example, the Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure as an OCI offering that utilizes machine learning capabilities. After an initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us . \n\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. We have invested billions of dollars over time to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings, including our acquisition of Cerner Corporation in June 2022 (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.\n\nWe have three businesses, cloud and license, hardware, and services, and each is comprised of a single operating segment. Item 7 Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments.\n\nOracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\nRecent Global Events\n\nOracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Neither of the aforementioned countries, nor Ukraine, have composed or are expected to compose a material portion of Oracle&#8217;s total consolidated revenues, net income, net assets, or workforce. Our business was also affected by the impacts of COVID-19 during the fiscal 2022 and 2021 periods presented in this Annual Report. For additional discussion of these matters and their impacts to Oracle, and a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors and Item 7 Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, each of which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nOracle Applications and Infrastructure Technologies\n\nOracle&#8217;s comprehensive portfolio of applications and infrastructure technologies is designed to address an organization&#8217;s IT environment needs including business process, infrastructure and applications development requirements, among others.

We also offer a range of management technologies and products, including Oracle Enterprise Manager and the Oracle Cloud Observability and Management Platform, designed to help customers efficiently operate complex IT environments, including both end users&#8217; and service providers&#8217; cloud environments . \n\nOracle Hardware Support \n\nOracle hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products such as for Oracle operating systems and firmware. These offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. We continue to evolve hardware support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware products. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees . \n\nOracle Services \n\nWe offer services to help customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings substantially include, among others:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nconsulting services, which are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our cloud and license offerings, including IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, implementation, integration, application development, security assessments and ongoing software enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\ndelivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners, consisting of consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nadvanced customer services, which are support services provided by Oracle to a customer on-site or remote to enable increased performance and higher availability of a customer&#8217;s Oracle products and services. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOracle Cloud Operations\n\nOracle Cloud Operations deliver our Oracle Cloud Services to customers through a secure, reliable, scalable, enterprise grade cloud infrastructure platform managed by Oracle employees within a global network of data centers, which we refer to as the Oracle Cloud. The Oracle Cloud enables secure and isolated cloud-based instances for each of our customers to access the functionality of Oracle Cloud Services via a broad spectrum of devices. Oracle Cloud Operations leverage automated software tools to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities to the Oracle Cloud as they become available, providing Oracle customers access to the latest Oracle releases generally on a quarterly cadence. We have invested in the expansion of the Oracle Cloud by increasing existing data center capacity and adding additional data centers in new geographic locations to meet current and expected customer demand. We expect this trend will continue. \n\nManufacturing \n\nWe rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce the substantial majority of our hardware products that we market and sell to customers and utilize internally to deliver Oracle Cloud Services, and we distribute most of our hardware products from these partners&#8217; facilities. Our manufacturing processes are substantially based on standardization of components across product types and centralization of assembly and distribution centers. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of suppliers. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternative sources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain hardware components. We monitor and evaluate potential risks of disruption within our supply chain operations. Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our hardware products and the related risks to our businesses. \n\nSales and Marketing\n\nWe directly market and sell our cloud, license, hardware, support and services offerings globally to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We also market and sell our offerings globally through indirect channels. \n\nIn the United States (U.S.), our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and other facilities throughout the country. Outside the U.S., our international subsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends, and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings. Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report. A summary of our domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nWe also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including cloud and license, hardware and services suppliers, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon and in conjunction with our product offerings. By offering our partners access to our product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally . \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nResearch and Development \n\nWe develop the substantial majority of our products and services offerings internally utilizing the skills and diversity of a global workforce. In addition, we have extended our products and services offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal businesses. Rapid technological advances in cloud, software and hardware development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current products and services offerings. \n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nAt Oracle, our success is driven by the quality of our people, who we believe are among the best and brightest in the industry. We strive to create an environment that supports employee success and a culture where everyone has a voice in driving innovation.\n\nWorkforce \n\nAs of May 31, 2022, we employed approximately 143,000 full-time employees, of which approximately 48,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 95,000 were employed internationally. Our approximate employee counts by lines of business are:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n38,000\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSales and marketing\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n25,000\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nServices\n\n&#160;\n\n21,000\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud services and license support operations\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n44,000\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nResearch and development\n\n&#160;\n\n3,000\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nHardware\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n12,000\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe average tenure of our employees is approximately seven years and 27% of our employees have been employed with Oracle for ten or more years.\n\nNone of our employees in the U.S. is represented by a labor union&#59; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers&#8217; councils represent some of our employees.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion \n\nWe believe that innovation starts with inclusion. Our focus on diversity and inclusion is reflected throughout our organization, starting at the highest level. Our Chief Executive Officer is a woman and forty percent of our Board members are women and/or come from a diverse background. We endeavor to hire employees from a broad pool of talent with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and abilities and we believe Oracle&#8217;s leaders serve as role models for our diverse and inclusive workforce. We seek to continuously build on our inclusive hiring strategies, tracking our progress and holding ourselves accountable for greater diversity at Oracle. Our programs are supported by Oracle leaders across the company with strategic sponsorship from Oracle&#8217;s Executive Diversity Council, which is led by Safra Catz, our Chief Executive Officer, and extend through the actions we are taking globally on Oracle&#8217;s five Diversity and Inclusion (D&#38;I) Imperatives:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ndriving insight and accountability with data&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nrecruiting with an intention on diversity&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nembedding inclusion into talent development&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ninspiring an inclusive culture through community&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ninvesting in the future diversity of our industry. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to global, regional and local programs, Oracle Human Resources partners with business leaders to create and implement D&#38;I plans to embed targeted strategies into organizations across Oracle. Employee satisfaction on the importance of D&#38;I at Oracle and their manager&#8217;s encouragement of diverse ideas and perspectives ranks high in our employee engagement surveys.\n\nWe are proud to be recognized for our progress and commitment to D&#38;I, including being named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality in 2022 by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a 2021 Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the Disability Equality Index, and a 2022 Top Supporter of Historically Black College and University Engineering Schools by Career Communications Group.\n\nLeaders Who Listen \n\nWe believe that an important aspect of creating a culture and environment that supports employee, customer and business success is listening to employee feedback. We share the results of our annual employee engagement survey with leaders who receive direct observations from employees about areas critical to Oracle&#8217;s strategic priorities, including the employee and customer experience. The results of the survey are also discussed with our Board of Directors and Board committees. Nearly 80% of our employees participate in the annual survey. Leaders listen to employees, evaluate feedback and prioritize actions to enhance employee, business and customer success.\n\nEmployee Experience \n\nEmerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, Oracle has further increased our focus on delivering a great employee experience, anchored by meaningful work, career opportunities and well-being, to continue to attract and retain high quality talent. We support employee well-being from multiple dimensions, including economic, health, development, and lifestyle with a comprehensive suite of compensation, benefits, learning and development, and flexible work options.\n\nOpportunities to Learn and Grow\n\nWe believe that one of the primary reasons candidates join Oracle is for career development and opportunities to grow their careers. We have programs and resources to help our employees explore, build and achieve their career goals. We also promote regular career conversations between leaders and employees. These are separate from performance feedback conversations and are focused on helping employees identify and take steps to grow their careers. Our Talent Review process, run on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM, provides the mechanism for leaders to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees. 24% of our open non-entry level positions were filled internally in fiscal 2022, providing growth opportunities and retaining critical knowledge and talent.\n\nHelping our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining them and critical to our ability to innovate and rapidly evolve. We support employees with anytime, everywhere learning resources to help build skills for today and the future. Oracle employees received two million hours of training in fiscal 2022 and accessed online learning content at an average rate of more than two million views per month. Our employees take advantage of online classes and learning resources on business and technical skills, as well as webinars and learning opportunities that are designed to support employee and family well-being.\n\nFlexible Work Options\n\nFor the vast majority of Oracle&#8217;s employees, productivity is not tied to being in an office and collaboration can happen between people anywhere. Oracle&#8217;s modern approach to work gives our employees more flexibility to choose where and how to work. Depending on their role, many of our employees can choose their office location, as well as work from home some or all of the time. We believe this allows us to engage with a wider pool of talent and retain employees who want or need more flexibility.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nMaking a Difference \n\nMany of our employees participate in Oracle&#8217;s corporate citizenship initiatives focused on education, the environment and community. Each year, through our volunteering and giving programs, employees donate tens of thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars (matched by Oracle) to a wide variety of causes. Of particular note are the efforts made by employees to support colleagues impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, above and beyond the direct support Oracle has provided. In addition to monetary donations by employees and by Oracle through its matching program to support humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine and Oracle employees in need, many employees have offered direct assistance to Ukrainian coworkers and their families as they seek safety.\n\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\n\nOur quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the IT industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. See &#8220;Cloud and License Business&#8221; in Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of the revenues, expenses and margins of our cloud and license business, which is our largest business.\n\nCompetition\n\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.\n\nOur customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments. Our enterprise cloud, license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Intel Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Adobe Systems Incorporated, Alphabet Inc., salesforce.com, inc. and SAP SE, as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions&#8212;including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lines&#8212;which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories. \n\nKey competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our products and services sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nmarket adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS and cloud infrastructure offerings&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ncompatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle Cloud environments&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe broader &#8220;platform&#8221; competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\noperating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Server, and other UNIX and Linux operating systems &#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nproducts, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nproducts, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFor more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nGovernmental Regulation\n\nWe operate globally and are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. For information about governmental regulations applicable to our business, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available, free of charge, on the SEC website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish them to, the SEC.

      "text": " Item 1A. \n\nRisk Factors\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; discussion in Item 7 Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.\n\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services. Rapid technological advances, intense competition, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas. \n\nWe have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if they fail to operate as anticipated or our other products do not perform as promised, our business and reputation may be harmed.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we held many of our major customer events in a virtual format. Our shift to virtual customer events may not be successful, and we may not be able to showcase our products as well as we have historically done through in-person events or generate the same customer interest, opportunities and leads through these virtual events. We currently plan to reintroduce large in-person events during fiscal 2023 but we may not be able to do so successfully and our customers may not be able or willing to attend them, which could adversely impact our ability to market and sell our products and services.\n\nIn addition, our business may be adversely affected if:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ninfrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe are unable to increase our existing data center capacity or establish data centers in new geographic locations in a timely manner to meet current or expected customer demand&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthere is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new, enhanced or acquired product lines or services&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthere are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner&#59; or \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur Oracle Cloud strategy, including our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability. We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via a variety of deployment models, including via our cloud-based SaaS and OCI offerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline. \n\nAs customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers predominantly purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably or as services are consumed over the terms of the subscriptions. Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transitions from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability . \n\nAs a part of our Oracle Cloud strategy, we plan our investment levels based on estimates of future revenues and future anticipated rates of growth. In recent periods, our cloud services and license support expenses have grown to meet current and expected demand for our cloud offerings, including investments to increase our existing data center capacity and to establish data centers in new geographic locations. In connection with these investments, we entered, and expect to continue to enter, into long-term operating lease commitments with third party data center providers that generally require us to pay fees to early exit such obligations should our strategies change, which could adversely impact our profitability and cash flows. In addition, we outfit these data centers with equipment and improvements that we typically depreciate over their estimated useful lives, which could be shortened should our cloud strategies change, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\nWe might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings. &#160; Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configuration errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function, integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings, could result in service interruptions, delays or outages of our cloud offerings, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nof our products or services. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we experience any of these errors, or if there are delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle&#8217;s business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our and our customers&#8217; abilities to conduct business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs. Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses , and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales . \n\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed. We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change. Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence, compute, storage and networking products, among others, which compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings. Use of our competitors&#8217; technologies influences a customer&#8217;s purchasing decision or creates an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services. Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services on terms that we may not generally find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more flexible business practices, provide debt or equity financing to customers or form strategic alliances with other companies. Mergers, consolidations or alliances among our competitors, or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may result in increased competition. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense. \n\nWe may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully. The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions could put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings that are less favorable to us, or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license, hardware and services offerings, and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure, all of which could reduce our revenues and/or profitability. Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings. \n\nChanges to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy, commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable, or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models.\n\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results . Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services or may be inefficient in our \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nresolution of customer support issues. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position . \n\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the sourcing of technologies and components, the results of these businesses will suffer. We depend on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could also be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest, other public health crises, changes to trade policies, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers. We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. From time to time, these partners experience production problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created, and likely will continue to create, delays in our supply chain. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused delays in the manufacturing and fulfilment of certain customer orders during fiscal 2022. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations. \n\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline. Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nour focus on certain of our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and certain other hardware products we consider strategic and the de-emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nchanges in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ndecreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ngeneral supply chain material shortages worldwide, which were further exacerbated globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity, which has in some instances increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and adversely impacted our operating cash flows.\n\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive. We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, acquisitions and other internal \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nand external considerations. These types of restructurings have resulted , and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings , and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected . \n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees. We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder&#59; our Chief Executive Officer&#59; other members of our executive team&#59; and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We recently reopened certain of our offices around the globe and we intend to reopen other offices when it is safe to do so and local requirements allow. Our employees continue to have flexibility to choose where and how to work. Depending on their role, this means that many employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all of the time. While we believe this may help us engage with a wider pool of talent and may help to retain employees who want or need more flexibility, it may fail to yield these desired benefits and could also lead to increased employee burnout or negatively impact employee productivity, and it may present cybersecurity risks and additional risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy. Despite our efforts to reopen our offices in a safe manner, our employees who have opted to return to the office may nevertheless be exposed to health risks, which may expose us to potential liability. \n\nWe may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.\n\nWe continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We are experiencing increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which has affected our employee retention efforts and increased our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.\n\nOur general compensation program includes restricted stock units and performance-based equity, which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\n\nOur cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results. Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nour contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nany of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken&#59; or \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe level of demand for our channel participants&#8217; products and services were to decrease. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.\n\nAcquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction. On June 8, 2022, we closed the acquisition of Cerner Corporation (&#8220;Cerner&#8221;). We continue to review and consider strategic acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program, such as our recent acquisition of Cerner, include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nour ongoing business may be disrupted and our management&#8217;s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company&#8217;s technologies or lines of business&#59; (2) entering new markets where we have no, or limited, direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions&#59; or (3) retaining key personnel from the acquired companies&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nan acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected, we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition, including intangible assets and goodwill&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nour operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by (1) claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition&#59; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships that we assume from an acquired company, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business&#59; and (3) unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company&#8217;s business practices&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including (1) if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew their contracts with the acquired company&#59; (2) if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base&#59; (3) if acquired customers do not elect to purchase our technologies due to differing business practices&#59; or (4) if contract models utilized by an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues in a manner that is consistent with our current accounting practices&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may have difficulty integrating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and related infrastructures&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced, delivered and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may incur higher than anticipated costs (1) to support, develop and deliver acquired products or services&#59; (2) for general and administrative functions that support new business models&#59; or (3) to comply with regulations applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we had anticipated&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, and we may need to divest or dispose of assets or businesses or take other actions in order to obtain such approvals&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nour use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe recently incurred additional debt to finance our acquisition of Cerner and in the future, we may have to incur additional debt to pay for other acquisitions or have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including arrangements that we may assume in an acquisition . \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected how we and our customers are operating our respective businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations remains uncertain. &#160; The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have affected how we and our customers, partners and suppliers are operating our businesses. Our operations have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement preventative measures to contain or control further spread of the virus, such as travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place/social distancing orders. These preventative measures led to sharp reductions in demand in certain industries in which our customers operate. It is not clear what long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, including the effects on our customers, partners, suppliers and prospects. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed. \n\nWe are a U.S. federal government contractor and are therefore subject to a federal executive order requiring our U.S.-based employees to be vaccinated unless they qualify for medical or religious exemptions. The executive order has been challenged in court and has been enjoined from enforcement, but its ultimate status, and the impact on our business, is uncertain. However, this requirement or other future vaccine mandates could adversely affect our workforce retention and hiring. In addition, customer vaccination requirements, as well as certain state and local vaccination mandates, may impact our staffing abilities.\n\nThe negative impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy and related impacts on our customers&#8217; business operations and their demand for our products will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Additional impacts and risks that we are not currently aware of may arise. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, partners, suppliers and other partners, but a material effect on these parties could also materially and adversely affect us. In addition, we have curtailed travel expenses since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it may become necessary for us to increase such travel expenses prospectively in furtherance of our business initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors section.\n\nData Privacy, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property Risks\n\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers&#8217; data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, any of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions. Our products and services, including Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage third-party data, such as our customers&#8217; information and data, as well as our own data. We believe that Oracle in particular is a target for computer hackers and other bad actors because Oracle stores and processes large amounts of data, including in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences, financial services, retail, hospitality and the government. We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties (which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation-states and individuals sponsored by them) to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers&#8217;, partners&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. Successful attempts by one of these malicious actors can lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Attempts of this nature typically involve IT-related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nsecurity vulnerabilities of networks, systems, products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers&#8217;, suppliers&#8217; or partners&#8217; data or the IT systems of Oracle, our customers, suppliers or partners. Our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud Services, may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee, contractor or supplier error or malfeasance . \n\nIf a cyber-attack or other security incident results in unauthorized access to or modification of our customers&#8217; or suppliers&#8217; data, other external data, our own data or our IT systems, or if the services we provide to our customers are disrupted, or if our products or services are reported to have or are perceived as having security vulnerabilities, we could incur significant expenses and suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation. If our customers lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to not be secure, they may decide to reduce or terminate their spend with us. In addition, cyber-attacks and other security incidents could lead to significant investigation and remediation costs, loss or destruction of information, interruption of our operations, inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations and financial penalties, and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring. Our remediation efforts may not be successful. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems, change frequently, grow more complex over time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques. Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. In addition, we often experience increased activity of this nature during times of instability, including during our office closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic when most of our employees were working solely from home, and our operations may be more susceptible to malfeasance due to operational changes instituted to comply with safety, health and regulatory requirements, among others. We may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach.\n\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on a wide variety of third-party products, components and services. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle.\n\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection. As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. Our recent acquisition of Cerner also subjects us to additional data privacy and other related regulations governing the healthcare industry and patient information, including but not limited to regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, the treatment of patient information, healthcare fraud and healthcare information sharing. \n\nIn the wake of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased, giving rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle, and if we are not deemed to be in compliance, could result in enforcement actions and/or fines. This is true in the U.S. where, for example, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia have enacted privacy laws, the U.S. Congress is considering several privacy bills at \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nthe federal level, and a number of other state legislatures are considering privacy laws. Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations . The GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, provides for monetary penalties of up to 4% of an organization&#8217;s worldwide revenue. These penalties can be significant. For example, one European data protection regulator has fined a major U.S. technology company &#8364;225 million for its data handling practices. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues to fine companies for unfair and deceptive data protection practices, and these fines may increase in size. Taken together, the changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection, and our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we have implemented contracts, diligence programs, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts, policies and procedures. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products and services . \n\nWe make statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy, information provided on our website and press statements. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.\n\nThird parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property for the sole purpose of monetization through infringement assertions. We expect to continue to receive such claims as: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe volume of issued patents continues to increase&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nnon-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nResponding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nbe time consuming, costly and result in litigation&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ndivert management&#8217;s time and attention from developing our business&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nrequire us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nrequire us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nrequire us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nrequire us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers&#59; or \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\notherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or otherwise use our intellectual property. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the claim scope we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection as \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nU.S. laws and courts. If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive . \n\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all. Developing our various product offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities, both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from acquired companies. Accelerated product and service introductions and short lifecycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nAdverse litigation results could affect our business. We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management&#8217;s attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. Even a favorable judgment may be subject to appeals leading to protracted litigation, additional costs and the prospect that our desired outcome will be overturned. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nWe may be subjected to increased taxes due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws or from adverse resolutions of tax audits and controversies. As a multinational corporation, we incur income taxes as well as non-income based taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, property and value-added taxes) in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the application of the various taxes to the businesses in which we engage, often requiring that we make judgments in determining our tax liabilities and worldwide provision for income taxes. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in the U.S. and internationally, which can lead to disagreements such as regarding our intercompany transfer prices and calculations and on the applicability of withholding taxes to our cross-border transactions. Any unfavorable resolution of these tax audits and controversies could cause our tax liabilities to increase and may have a material and adverse impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. Although we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and tax accruals. \n\nCountries around the world continually consider and make changes to relevant tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, guidance and interpretations. In the U.S., various legislative proposals, if enacted, would substantially raise U.S. income taxes on our domestic and international profits. Such unfavorable tax legislation resulting from the shifting U.S. political landscape and economic environment create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have a material adverse impact on our future income tax provisions and effective tax rate. For example, in November 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill titled the &#8220;Build Back Better Act&#8221; under budget reconciliation procedures. While that bill, to date, has failed to advance in the Senate, it is possible that a modified version of the bill containing similar revenue provisions will be enacted, which, depending on the specific provisions included, could materially increase our future tax liabilities and effective tax rate.\n\nOther countries also continue to consider changes to their tax laws that could negatively affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our international revenue streams, operations and cross-border transactions, including the imposition of taxes targeted at digital technology businesses and changes in withholding tax rules. More fundamentally, 137 countries, including the U.S., in a global effort led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have politically committed to implementing tax changes that would provide \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\ngreater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located and impose minimum taxes on corporate profits. If enacted, these proposals would materially increase the level of income tax on our international profits. \n\nOur future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase if any of the foregoing potential tax changes are implemented or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, fluctuations in our stock price and level of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.\n\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. These laws can require suspension or termination of business, including financial transactions, in certain countries, territories or with certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in response to the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S. and other countries have announced extensive sanctions against Russia and could impose broader sanctions or take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Oracle recorded fiscal 2022 revenues of $248 million from these two countries, a reduction of $118 million relative to fiscal 2021. No revenues are expected to be recognized from these two countries prospectively. Compliance with these laws also requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management&#8217;s attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts. \n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information. No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.\n\nWe are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ngeneral economic conditions in each country or region&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\npolitical unrest, terrorism, war and the potential for other hostilities, including but not limited to, the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, the economic impact thereof and the potential to subject our business to materially adverse consequences should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the rest of Europe, where a material portion of our business is carried out &#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\npublic health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ndifficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular our cash assets, in that country&#8217;s currency&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nregulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ncommon local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nnatural disasters&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nthe effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity)&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\noverlapping tax regimes&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our supply chain operations and sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.\n\nAs the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly traded company in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entities were wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\nOur sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws relating to the award, administration and performance of those contracts. \n\nGovernmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services. Changes in government procurement policy, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and/or requirements may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector. For example, the U.S. government imposes evolving cybersecurity requirements, including, for example, the FedRAMP authorization process and the Department of Defense (DoD) Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. These requirements may impact our lines of business in the U.S. federal government market. Compliance with these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly, and failure to meet, or delays in meeting, the required security controls could limit our ability to sell products and services, directly or indirectly, to the DoD and other federal and state government entities that implement similar cybersecurity requirements.\n\nWe are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time, without cause. For example, the U.S. federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience, or for default based on our performance.\n\nU.S. federal, state and local government and foreign government contracts are generally subject to government funding authorizations/appropriations. Contracts may be terminated based upon a lack of government funds.\n\nThere is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending as governments continue to face significant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs.\n\nGovernment contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If violations of law are found, they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nsanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. \n\nEnvironmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs. Our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labeling requirements. Compliance with these ever-changing environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses. Regulatory, market, and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow. \n\nA significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China&#8217;s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. \n\nWe have an Environmental Steering Committee (ESC) comprised of senior individuals from a wide range of Oracle business units, including our Chief Sustainability Officer who oversees our overall sustainability strategy, including climate related risk mitigation. The ESC evaluates if climate or environmental risks have the potential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core and/or strategic business functions, including service delivery and support, product development and deployment, supply chain management, facility operations, employee recruitment and retention, or brand reputation. A failure by the ESC to identify and assess these risks could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth. \n\nWe publish an annual Corporate Citizenship Report, which includes disclosure of our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters and goals. Our disclosures on these matters, and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may potentially harm our reputation and brand. By electing to set and share publicly these corporate ESG standards, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG activities.\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors that make our results of operations difficult for us to predict. Our revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. A substantial portion of our cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large license transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions. In addition, sudden shifts in regional or global economic or political activity may cause our sales forecasts to be inaccurate. \n\nIn addition, we hold a portfolio of publicly traded and privately held equity investments. Changes in the fair values of these investments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses as a component of consolidated net income in each period. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these investments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies or funds in which we invest, and are subject to the general conditions of public and private equity markets, which are uncertain and have in the past \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nvaried, and may in the future vary, materially by period and may create volatility in our net income that is not reflective of our core businesses . \n\nChanges in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability. &#160; We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen, Saudi Arabian Riyal, Indian Rupee and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our reported revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies and reported in U.S. Dollars. \n\nIn addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, including the cost to obtain such contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and any related fees paid to purchase such contracts, and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nWe have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar. We could incur future losses in emerging market countries and other countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary. \n\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness. As of May 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of $75.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2022 and calendar year 2061, we incurred additional indebtedness to finance our acquisition of Cerner in June 2022, and we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. \n\nWe may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.\n\nShould we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nand effective tax rate. In addition, changes to our outlook or credit rating or a withdrawal by any rating agency could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . \n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value. &#160; All of the factors discussed within this Risk Factors section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new cloud services, products, product enhancements, technological advances, acquisitions or major transactions could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price. Our stock price could also be affected by factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others: speculation in the press, social media and the analyst community&#59; changes in recommendations or earnings related estimates by financial analysts&#59; changes in investors&#8217; or analysts&#8217; valuation measures for our stock&#59; negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys&#59; earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors&#8217; expectations&#59; our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management&#8217;s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. In fiscal 2022, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $10.0 billion. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. \n\nGeneral Risks\n\nEconomic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ngeneral economic and business conditions&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\noverall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ngovernmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ngeneral legal, regulatory and political developments. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMacroeconomic developments such as the global or regional economic effects resulting from the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, increasing inflation rates and related economic curtailment initiatives, the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom leaving the EU (Brexit), evolving trade policies between the U.S. and international trade partners, or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic, political or market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.\n\nIn addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nuncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings. \n\nBusiness disruptions could adversely affect our operating results. &#160; A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas, some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, including some of our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes. A major earthquake or fire, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as increased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations, supply chains or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n##TABLE_START "

This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 can be found in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on June 21, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise deployments, cloud-based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers&#8217; needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license&#59; hardware&#59; and services&#59; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\n\nCloud and License Business \n\nOur cloud and license business, which represented 85% and 84% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nCloud services and license support revenues, which include: \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\no \n\nlicense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license&#59; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed&#59; are generally renewed at the customer&#8217;s option&#59; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\no \n\ncloud services revenues, which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\ncustomers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed&#59; generally have durations of one to three years&#59; are generally renewed at the customer&#8217;s option&#59; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time . \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nProviding choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, hardware revenues and services revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services and license support revenues represented 71% of our total revenues during each of fiscal 2022 and 2021 and 70% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020. \n\nOur cloud and license business&#8217; revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions&#59; governmental budgetary constraints&#59; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings&#59; customer satisfaction with our offerings&#59; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base&#59; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases&#59; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses&#59; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold&#59; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand&#59; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nexpected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ncontinued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business&#8217; total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\n\nOur cloud and license business&#8217; margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business&#8217; revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business&#8217; revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\ncustomer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers&#8217; cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner&#59; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery&#59; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods . \n\nHardware Business \n\nOur hardware business, which represented 7% and 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.\n\nWe generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. \n\nOur quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners&#8217; abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, with this factor becoming more pronounced in recent periods due to global supply chain constraints for certain technology components&#59; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings&#59; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings&#59; the strength of general economic and business conditions&#59; governmental budgetary constraints&#59; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale&#59; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age&#59; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available&#59; and foreign currency rate fluctuations . \n\nServices Business \n\nOur services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2022 and 2021, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services&#59; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings&#59; general economic conditions&#59; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\ngovernmental budgetary constraints&#59; personnel reductions in our customers&#8217; IT departments&#59; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending&#59; and foreign currency rate fluctuations . \n\nAcquisitions \n\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. As compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. On December 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Cerner Corporation (Cerner), a provider of digital information systems used within hospitals and health systems that are designed to enable medical professionals to deliver better healthcare to individual patients and communities, for a preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $28.2 billion. The transaction closed on June 8, 2022. Notes 2 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our acquisition of Cerner and our other recent acquisitions.\n\nWe believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nRevenue Recognition&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nBusiness Combinations&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets&#8212;Impairment Assessments&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nAccounting for Income Taxes&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information about our critical and other accounting policies.\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606, Revenue Recognition from Customers , and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation. \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nMany of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied . \n\nWe use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues . \n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis&#59; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition&#8217;s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nFor a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. \n\nIf we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\n\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance&#8217;s or contingency&#8217;s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets&#8212;Impairment Assessments \n\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.\n\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors&#59; financial performance&#59; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors&#59; entity specific factors&#59; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.\n\nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.\n\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In such situations, we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable. We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.\n\nAccounting for Income Taxes \n\nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\ntreatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. \n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time.\n\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.\n\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; above. \n\nFor those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes , which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nlitigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of ope rations and financial position. \n\nResults of Operations\n\nRecent Global Events \n\nOracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Neither of the aforementioned countries, nor Ukraine, have composed or are expected to compose a material portion of Oracle&#8217;s total consolidated revenues, net income, net assets, or workforce. We serve hundreds of thousands of customers globally across a broad geographic and industry base. We are profitable and generate a large amount of positive cash flow from our operations, and we do not believe the current posture of the Russia-Ukraine situation will jeopardize either of these characteristics of our business. Other impacts due to this rapidly evolving situation are currently unknown and could potentially subject our business to materially adverse consequences. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, for a discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to the risks included in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the information presented below in Results of Operations in this Item 7.\n\nPresentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information \n\nIn our fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.\n\nIn addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 results of each of our three businesses&#8212;cloud and license, hardware and services&#8212;which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting . The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.\n\nConsistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation for fiscal 2021 is noted to include any revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2021 due to certain business combination accounting requirements that were eliminated in fiscal 2022. Refer to &#8220;Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges&#8221; below for additional discussion of these items and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2021.\n\nIn addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses or income, net and (provision for) benefit from income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to &#8220;Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges&#8221; below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nreconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2022 and 2021 . \n\nWe experienced COVID-19 related impacts to our businesses during fiscal 2022 and 2021. Certain of these historical impacts to our operating results are further discussed below. Any future impacts are currently unknown.\n\nSeparately, \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nas described further below and in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we remitted and recorded $4.7 billion for certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nas described further above, Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Oracle recorded fiscal 2022 revenues of $248 million from these two countries, a reduction of $118 million relative to fiscal 2021. No revenues are expected to be recognized from these two countries prospectively&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nas described further below and in Notes 1 and 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we recorded a $2.3 billion one-time net deferred tax benefit during fiscal 2021 that related to a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nConstant Currency Presentation \n\nOur international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses&#8217; revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses&#8217; revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2021, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2022 and 2021, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.07 million in fiscal 2022 (using 1.07 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.22 million in fiscal 2021 (using 1.22 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2022 results using the fiscal 2021 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Revenues and Operating Expenses \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPercent Change\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nActual\n\n&#160;\n\nConstant\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Revenues by Geography : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmericas\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n23,679\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8%\n\n&#160;\n\n8%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n21,828\n\n&#160;\n\nEMEA (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n12,011\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1%\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n11,894\n\n&#160;\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6,750\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0%\n\n&#160;\n\n4%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6,757\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n42,440\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n7%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n40,479\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Operating Expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n31,514\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n25%\n\n&#160;\n\n26%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n25,266\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Operating Margin\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n10,926\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-28%\n\n&#160;\n\n-25%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n15,213\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Operating Margin %\n\n&#160;\n\n26%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n38%\n\n&#160;\n\n% Revenues by Geography : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmericas\n\n&#160;\n\n56%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n54%\n\n&#160;\n\nEMEA\n\n&#160;\n\n28%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n29%\n\n&#160;\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n&#160;\n\n16%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n17%\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Revenues by Business : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud and license\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n36,052\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6%\n\n&#160;\n\n7%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n34,099\n\n&#160;\n\nHardware\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,183\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-5%\n\n&#160;\n\n-3%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,359\n\n&#160;\n\nServices\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,205\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6%\n\n&#160;\n\n8%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,021\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n42,440\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n7%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n40,479\n\n&#160;\n\n% Revenues by Business : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud and license\n\n&#160;\n\n85%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n84%\n\n&#160;\n\nHardware\n\n&#160;\n\n7%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8%\n\n&#160;\n\nServices\n\n&#160;\n\n8%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8%\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nComprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2022 due to growth in our cloud and license business&#8217; revenues and services business&#8217; revenues, which were partially offset by a decline in our hardware business&#8217; revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business&#8217; revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models. Customers also renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services. The constant currency increase in our services business&#8217; revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was attributable to an increase in revenues for each of our primary services offerings. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business&#8217; revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our non-strategic hardware products and related support services. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 68%, 22% and 10%, respectively, to our total revenue growth during fiscal 2022.\n\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 substantially due to certain litigation related charges recorded to acquisition related and other expenses as further described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition, our total operating expenses increased due to higher cloud services and license support expenses, which were primarily due to higher employee related expenses and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business&#8217; revenues&#59; higher services expenses, which increased primarily due to higher employee related and external contractor expenses&#59; and higher research and development and general and administrative expenses, both of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets, lower restructuring expenses and by $250 million of gains from operating asset sales, which were allocated across most of our operating expense lines during fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022 and \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n2021, we curtailed certain variable expenditures including employee travel expenses, among others, primarily in response to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses may normalize in future periods provided global economic and health conditions improve . \n\nIn constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased in fiscal 2022, relative to fiscal 2021, substantially due to the unfavorable impact of the fiscal 2022 litigation related charges referenced above, partially offset by higher fiscal 2022 total margin generated by our operating segments and the aforementioned gains from operating asset sales during fiscal 2022.\n\nSupplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. \n\nOur operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud services and license support deferred revenues (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nAmortization of intangible assets (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,150\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,379\n\n&#160;\n\nAcquisition related and other (3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,713\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRestructuring (4) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-based compensation, operating segments (5) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-based compensation, R&#38;D and G&#38;A (5) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,878\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,324\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome tax effects (6) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1,723\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(3,408\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,944\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nDue to business combination accounting rules that were applicable to acquisitions closed prior to fiscal 2022, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed and did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts presented in the above table for fiscal 2021 that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations.

Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPercent Change\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nActual\n\n&#160;\n\nConstant\n\n&#160;\n\n2021 (1) \n\n&#160;\n\nCloud and License Revenues : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmericas\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n20,594\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10%\n\n&#160;\n\n10%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n18,783\n\n&#160;\n\nEMEA\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10,016\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1%\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9,928\n\n&#160;\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5,442\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1%\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5,390\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n36,052\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6%\n\n&#160;\n\n7%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n34,101\n\n&#160;\n\nExpenses : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud services and license support (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,915\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n19%\n\n&#160;\n\n20%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,133\n\n&#160;\n\nSales and marketing (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n7,054\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4%\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6,799\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal expenses (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n11,969\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9%\n\n&#160;\n\n11%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10,932\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Margin\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n24,083\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4%\n\n&#160;\n\n6%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n23,169\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Margin %\n\n&#160;\n\n67%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n68%\n\n&#160;\n\n% Revenues by Geography : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmericas\n\n&#160;\n\n57%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n55%\n\n&#160;\n\nEMEA\n\n&#160;\n\n28%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n29%\n\n&#160;\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n&#160;\n\n15%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n16%\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues by Offerings : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud services and license support (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n30,174\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n6%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n28,702\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud license and on-premise license\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5,878\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9%\n\n&#160;\n\n12%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5,399\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n36,052\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6%\n\n&#160;\n\n7%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n34,101\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud Services and License Support Revenues by Ecosystem : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nApplications cloud services and license support\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12,612\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8%\n\n&#160;\n\n8%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n11,713\n\n&#160;\n\nInfrastructure cloud services and license support\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n17,562\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3%\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n16,989\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal cloud services and license support revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n30,174\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5%\n\n&#160;\n\n6%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n28,702\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nRevenues presented for fiscal 2021 included cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2021 due to business combination accounting rules that were applicable to acquisitions closed prior to fiscal 2022. Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for fiscal 2021 for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See &#8220;Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information&#8221; above for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nExcludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under &#8220;Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information&#8221; above. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business&#8217; total revenues increased in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support for which we delivered such cloud and support services during fiscal 2022. Our total cloud services revenues increased to $10.8 billion in fiscal 2022 from $8.9 billion in fiscal 2021 due to growth in our Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 71%, 18% and 11%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2022.\n\nIn constant currency, our total cloud and license business&#8217; expenses increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to higher cloud services and license support expenses, primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to higher headcount and higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business&#8217; revenues&#59; and higher sales and marketing expenses, primarily due to higher employee related expenses from higher headcount. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by an allocation of a portion of the gains from fiscal 2022 operating asset sales as described above. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods and we expect this growth to continue to accelerate in \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nfiscal 2023 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand . \n\nExcluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business&#8217; total margin increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to fiscal 2022 increases in total revenues for this business, while total fiscal 2022 margin as a percentage of revenues for this business decreased slightly due to expenses growth.\n\nHardware Business \n\nOur hardware business&#8217; revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete&#59; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts&#59; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services&#59; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings. &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPercent Change\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nActual\n\n&#160;\n\nConstant\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nHardware Revenues : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmericas\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,558\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-6%\n\n&#160;\n\n-6%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,650\n\n&#160;\n\nEMEA\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-4%\n\n&#160;\n\n1%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-6%\n\n&#160;\n\n-3%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,183\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-5%\n\n&#160;\n\n-3%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,359\n\n&#160;\n\nExpenses : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nHardware products and support (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0%\n\n&#160;\n\n2%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSales and marketing (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-7%\n\n&#160;\n\n-5%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal expenses (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,305\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-2%\n\n&#160;\n\n0%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,333\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Margin\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,878\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-7%\n\n&#160;\n\n-5%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,026\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Margin %\n\n&#160;\n\n59%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n60%\n\n&#160;\n\n% Revenues by Geography : \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmericas\n\n&#160;\n\n49%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n49%\n\n&#160;\n\nEMEA\n\n&#160;\n\n30%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n30%\n\n&#160;\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n&#160;\n\n21%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n21%\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ( 1 ) \n\nExcludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations.

This unfavorable variance was partially offset by lower income taxes of $824 million associated with lower pre-tax income in fiscal 2022 that was primarily attributable to certain litigation related charges as further described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and, to a much lesser extent, a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings partially offset by a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and other events.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nChange\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWorking capital\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12,122\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-61%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n31,403\n\n&#160;\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n21,902\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-53%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n46,554\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWorking capital : The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2022 in comparison to May 31, 2021 was primarily due to $16.2 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, $4.7 billion of cash paid for certain litigation related charges that we generally do not expect to recur, $3.8 billion of long-term senior notes that were reclassified to current liabilities, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income, net cash proceeds of $318 million associated with the sale of certain operating assets, and cash proceeds from stock option exercises, all of which occurred during fiscal 2022. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities : Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain other securities. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2022 in comparison to May 31, 2021 was primarily due to $16.2 billion of settled repurchases of our common stock, $8.3 billion of debt repayments, $4.7 billion of cash paid for certain litigation related charges that we generally do not expect to recur, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures.

Payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts&#8217; terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to lower net income that was primarily the result of cash payments made in connection with certain litigation related charges that we generally do not expect to recur and certain other cash unfavorable working capital changes, net, in each case during fiscal 2022 in comparison to fiscal 2021.\n\nCash flows from investing activities : The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. \n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $11.2 billion during fiscal 2022 in comparison to net cash used for investing activities of $13.1 billion during fiscal 2021. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in the cash used for the purchases of marketable securities and \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nother investments, partially offset by a decrease in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and other investments and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures, in each case during fiscal 2022 in comparison to fiscal 2021 . \n\nCash flows from financing activities : The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. \n\nNet cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2022 increased compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an issuance of $15.0 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2021 with no corresponding issuance of senior notes in fiscal 2022, higher debt repayments, higher net cash used for our employee stock program, and higher payments of dividends, partially offset by lower stock repurchases, in each case during fiscal 2022 in comparison to fiscal 2021.\n\nFree cash flow : To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nChange\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n9,539\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-40%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n15,887\n\n&#160;\n\nCapital expenditures\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(4,511\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n111%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(2,135\n\n)\n\nFree cash flow\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n5,028\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-63%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n13,752\n\n&#160;\n\nNet income\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n6,717\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n13,746\n\n&#160;\n\nFree cash flow as percent of net income\n\n&#160;\n\n75%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n100%\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRecent Financing Activities : \n\nCredit Agreements and Related Borrowings : In March 2022, we entered into a $6.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $15.7 billion, 364-day delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the Bridge Credit Agreement). In June 2022, in connection with the acquisition of Cerner, we borrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement. Additional information is included in Notes 7 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nCash Dividends : &#160; In fiscal 2022, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.28 per share that totaled $3.5 billion. In June 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 26, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 12, 2022. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. \n\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program : Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On December 9, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2022, approximately $9.4 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 185.8 million shares for $16.2 billion, 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion, and 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nContractual Obligations : &#160; Our l argest contractual obligations as of May 31, 202 2 consisted of: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nprincipal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nour acquisition of Cerner, which closed on June 8, 2022 and for which we borrowed $15.7 billion on the same day pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nroutine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included in our consolidated balance sheet&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\noperating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nother contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition, as of May 31, 2022, we had $8.9 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2023. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. Notes 2, 7, 13 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies.\n\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, and the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Bridge Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.\n\nStock-Based Awards\n\nOur stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. \n\nWe recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2019 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.3% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2022, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2022, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 8.4%.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees&#59; all stock-based award grants to senior officers&#59; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2022 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nS tock-based award s activity from June 1, 201 9 through May 31, 20 2 2 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2019\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-based awards granted and assumed\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-based awards vested and issued and, if applicable, exercised\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(211\n\n)\n\nForfeitures, cancellations and other, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(54\n\n)\n\nStock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-average annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-average annualized stock repurchases\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(292\n\n)\n\nShares outstanding at May 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,665\n\n&#160;\n\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,952\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n8.4%\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal in the money stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2022) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n8.4%\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-average annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n1.3%\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-average annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n-8.6%\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\n##TABLE_START "

      "text": " Item 7A. \n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nEquity Price Risk\n\nMarketable and Non-Marketable Equity Investments \n\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities investments totaled $1.1 billion and $946 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our marketable equity securities investments in publicly traded companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. Our non-marketable equity securities investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment. Our non-marketable equity securities investments accounted for under the equity method, primarily in a related party entity, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these equity method investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover. The timing and amounts of changes in fair value, if any, of our marketable and non-marketable equity investments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies in which we invest. For additional disclosure regarding the impact to our quarterly results of operations from investment volatility, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nCurrency Risk \n\nForeign Currency Translation Risk \n\nAs described under &#8220;Constant Currency Presentation&#8221; above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. In particular, the strengthening of \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nthe U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, total revenues and total expense s that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period . \n\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk \n\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. Our principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Saudi Arabian Riyal, Indian Rupee and British Pound. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions. We have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for trading purposes.\n\nWe realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, and we also incur costs to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, substantially all of which are included in non-operating expenses or income, net in our consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts.\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nThe following table sets forth the hypothetical potential losses that we consider to be the most material to the reported fair values and/or future earnings of our interest rate, equity price and foreign currency influenced holdings, prior to any income tax effects, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates as of or for the reporting periods below:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\nHypothetical Change\n\n&#160;\n\nImpact\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEquity price risk:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMarketable and non-marketable equity investments\n\n&#160;\n\n25% decrease in market price and fair values\n\n&#160;\n\nEarnings\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n(277\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n(236\n\n)\n\nForeign currency risk:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n10% decrease in foreign exchange rates\n\n&#160;\n\nEarnings\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n(2,107\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n(2,061\n\n)\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n&#160;\n\n10% decrease in foreign exchange rates\n\n&#160;\n\nFair values\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n(421\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n(650\n\n)\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission&#8217;s 2013 framework. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2022. We reviewed the results of management&#8217;s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst &#38; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\n\nOur management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nalso is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions&#59; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \n\n##TABLE_START "

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 21, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome Tax &#8211; Uncertain tax positions\n\nDescription of the matter\n\n&#160;\n\nAs discussed in Note 13 of the financial statements, the Company recognizes uncertain tax positions and measures unrecognized tax benefits related to various domestic and foreign matters. As of May 31, 2022, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $7.3 billion, of which $4.3 billion, if recognized would impact the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate. The Company uses significant judgment in the accounting for uncertain tax positions including the interpretation and application of tax laws and legal rulings in various jurisdictions.\n\nAuditing management&#8217;s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions was complex, involved significant judgment, and was based on interpretations and application of tax laws and legal rulings.\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START How w e a ddressed the m atter in o ur a udit \n\n&#160;\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over management&#8217;s process for interpretation and application of tax laws and legal rulings, as well as development of the assumptions and estimates used in the measurement of uncertain tax positions.\n\nTo test management&#8217;s assessment of which uncertain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, we performed audit procedures that included, among others reading and evaluating management&#8217;s assumptions and analysis, including any communications with taxing authorities that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. \n\nIn addition, we also evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures in relation to these matters included in Note 13 of the financial statements.\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2002.\n\nSan Jose, California \n\nJune 21, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Oracle Corporation\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Oracle Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Oracle Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated June 21, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company&#59; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company&#59; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nSan Jose, California \n\nJune 21, 2022\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#160;\n\nORACLE

substantially address all aspects of enterprise information technology (IT) environments, including applications and infrastructure technologies. We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based, Cloud&#64;Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer&#8217;s own data center), on-premise and hybrid models. Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide a comprehensive and integrated stack of applications and infrastructure services delivered via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, deploys, hosts, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\nBasis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle&#8217;s stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $ 4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges that are more fully described in Note 16 below. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2021 was impacted by a $ 2.3 billion net income tax benefit related to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Refer to Note 13 below for additional information regarding our income taxes.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes&#59; and ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , neither of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2022. \n\nUse of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\ninformation available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management&#8217;s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management&#8217;s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nOur sources of revenues include:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ncloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support&#59; and cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nhardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage products, and industry-specific hardware&#59; and hardware support revenues&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nservices revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting and advanced customer services. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLicense support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\n\nCloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Services offerings, which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. \n\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer&#8217;s option. \n\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware. Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.\n\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services. \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) as a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud, license, hardware and services arrangements and generally require revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to our customers, reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to receive for those goods or services. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps : \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\ndetermination of the transaction price&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nallocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nrecognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS and cloud infrastructure contracts are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed. \n\nOur revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud Services \n\nRevenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to a customer. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period. Revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer. \n\nRevenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support \n\nOracle&#8217;s primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period, if and when they are available, and hardware product repairs, as applicable. Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\navailable continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, revenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided . &#160; \n\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and On-Premise Licenses \n\nRevenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer.\n\nRevenue Recognition for Hardware Products \n\nThe hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer.\n\nRevenue Recognition for Services \n\nServices revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion. Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed.\n\nAllocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations \n\nMany of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency&#59; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract. \n\nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations from Customer Contracts \n\nTrade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2022 and 2021. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was approximately $ 8.8 billion and $ 8.0 billion, respectively. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues&#59; invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues&#59; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2022, our remaining performance obligations were $ 46.6 billion, approximately 57 % of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months, 32 % over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, and the remainder thereafter.\n\nSales of Financing Receivables \n\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts&#8217; dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, $ 1.8 billion, $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.5 billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis&#59; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition&#8217;s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , and are accounted for separately from the business \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\ncombination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. A bandoned operating leases related to an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as Right-of-Use ( ROU ) asset impairment charges pursuant to ASC 842, Leases and are accounted for separately from the business combination. In all periods presented, when estimating the asset impairment charges, assumptions were applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made . \n\nFor a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the business acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\n\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance&#8217;s or contingency&#8217;s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\n\nMarketable and Non-Marketable Investments \n\nIn accordance with ASC 320, Investments&#8212;Debt Securities , and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all of our marketable debt securities investments as available-for-sale. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders&#8217; equity, except for any unrealized losses determined to be related to credit losses, which we record within non-operating expenses or income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantially all of our marketable debt securities investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\nInvestments in equity securities, other than any equity method investments, are generally recorded at their fair values, if the fair values are readily determinable. Non-marketable equity securities where we do not have control of, nor significant influence in, the investee are recorded at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer with any gains or losses recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net as of and for each reporting period. For investments through which we have significant influence in, but not control of, the investee, we account for such investments pursuant to the equity method of accounting whereby we record our proportionate share of the investee&#8217;s earnings or losses, amortization of differences between our investment basis and the proportional book equity of the investee, and impairment, if any, as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net for each reporting period. \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nOur non-marketable debt investments and equity securities and related instruments totaled $ 1.2 b illion and $ 971 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are subject to periodic impairment reviews and are generally classified as a part of non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Certain of these instruments are adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions. The substantial majority of the non-marketable debt investments and equity securities and related instruments held as of May 31, 2022 and 2021 were with a related party entity for which we follow the equity method of accounting. We are also a counterparty to certain options to acquire additional equity interests in that entity at various times through December 2023 and we could obtain control of that entity should such options be exercised . \n\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments. \n\nThe additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4. \n\nAllowances for Credit Losses \n\nWe record allowances for credit losses based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current and expected future economic conditions. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success . \n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk \n\nFinancial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities. Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.\n\nWe outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of the substantial majority of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our cloud and license and hardware businesses. \n\nInventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\ndemand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 314 million and $ 142 million at May 31, 20 2 2 and 20 2 1 , respectively. \n\nOther Receivables \n\nOther receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 791 million and $ 798 million at May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nDeferred Sales Commissions\n\nWe defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support and hardware support contract. Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four years. We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to certain of our cloud-based arrangements are generally deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period, which is generally one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and asset balances for deferred sales commissions are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to 40 years . Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.\n\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are itemized in Note 6 below and are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years . Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. \n\nThe carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed for impairment, we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment (optional assessment) prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors considered for a reporting unit include: cost factors&#59; financial performance&#59; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors&#59; entity specific factors&#59; industry and market considerations&#59; macroeconomic conditions&#59; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine in \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nthe qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis&#59; the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis&#59; future economic and market conditions &#59; and market comparable s of peer companies, among others. If , as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit. Our most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1, 20 2 2 and did no t result in a goodwill impairment charge . W e did not recognize impairment charge s in fiscal 20 2 1 or 20 20 . \n\nRecoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets and may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a shorter amortization period is more reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows. \n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of each reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives&#8217; fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges). \n\nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged.\n\nLeases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments, because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not known. ROU assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives. Our lease terms that are used in determining our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as operating expenses. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such cases, we generally account for the components as a single lease component. We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term of less than one year.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nROU assets related to our operating leases are included in other non-current assets, short-term operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash flow movements related to our lease activities are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities as presented in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 202 2 and 202 1 . Note 1 0 below provides additional information regarding our leases . \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. Descriptions of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination are provided under &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 16 below provides additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country&#8217;s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are substantially included in stockholders&#8217; equity as a component of AOCL in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating expenses or income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $ 199 million, $ 112 million and $ 185 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nWe account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of service-based restricted stock unit awards, service-based employee stock options, performance-based stock options (PSOs), and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation &#8212; Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur. \n\nFor our service-based stock awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years .\n\nFor our PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis related to awards that are probable of achievement over the longer of the (a) estimated implicit service period for performance-metric achievement, or (b) derived service period for market-based metric achievement. During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered. Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively. \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in such period. Note 1 2 below provides additional information regarding our stock-based compensation plans and related expenses . \n\nAdvertising \n\nSubstantially all advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.\n\nA two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nA description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; above.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nFinancial Instruments : In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional guidance for contract modifications and certain hedging relationships associated with the transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. We will adopt Topic 848 when our relevant contracts are modified upon transition to alternative reference rates and expect this to occur through December 31, 2022. We do not expect our adoption of Topic 848 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_START 2. \n\nACQUISITIONS\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAcquisition of Cerner Corporation\n\nOn December 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Cerner Corporation (Cerner), a provider of digital information systems used within hospitals and health systems that are designed to enable medical professionals to deliver better healthcare to individual patients and communities.\n\nOn January 19, 2022, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Cerner at a purchase price of $ 95.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, based upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated January 19, 2022 , and the related Letter of Transmittal.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nOn June 8, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the tender offer and applicable Delaware law, we acquired all the outstanding Cerner shares and effectuated the merger of Cerner with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle and Cerner became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. Vested equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash based on a formula contained in the Merger Agreement. The unvested equity awards to acquire Cerner common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger were converted into equity awards denominated in shares of Oracle common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We will include the financial results of Cerner in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\n\nThe total preliminary purchase price for Cerner is approximately $ 28.2 billion, which consisted of approximately $ 28.2 billion in cash and $ 43 million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. In connection with the acquisition of Cerner, we assumed $ 1.6 billion of senior notes and other borrowings, of which $ 1.5 billion were paid on June 8, 2022.\n\nOther Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 Acquisitions \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings . These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 3. \n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of time deposits and certain other securities.\n\nThe amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2022 and 2021. We use the specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realized gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\n\nRestricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2022 and 2021 and our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was nominal.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 4. \n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. \n\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset&#8217;s or a liability&#8217;s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nLevel 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nLevel 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities&#59; or \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nLevel 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n\nOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMay 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMay 31, 2021\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nUsing Input Types\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nUsing Input Types\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\nLevel 1\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nLevel 2\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nLevel 1\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nLevel 2\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\nAssets:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMoney market funds\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12,842 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12,842 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12,263 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12,263 \n\n&#160;\n\nTime deposits and other\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,250 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8,220 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9,470 \n\n&#160;\n\nCommercial paper debt securities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n11,712 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n11,712 \n\n&#160;\n\nDerivative financial instruments\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal assets\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n13,082 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n13,362 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n13,513 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n20,005 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n33,518 \n\n&#160;\n\nLiabilities:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDerivative financial instruments\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nOur marketable securities investments consist of money market funds, time deposits and certain other securities.

the economic effects of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with the 2.80% senior notes that were outstanding as of May 31, 2021 and that were due and were settled in July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The effective interest rates after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements was 0.87 % for the July 2021 Notes as of May 31, 2021. Refer to Note 1 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nIn July 2013, we issued &#8364; 750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the July 2025 Notes in the table above were calculated using foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable, as of May 31, 2022 and May 31, 2021, respectively. The July 2025 Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (3) \n\nIn fiscal 2018 we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $ 871 million based on LIBOR. The effective interest rates as of May 31, 2022 and 2021 after consideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements were 4.10 % and 3.15 %, respectively, for the July 2025 Notes. Refer to Note 1 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFuture principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2025 Notes) for all of our borrowings at May 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2023\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,750 \n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal 2024\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,500 \n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal 2025\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10,000 \n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal 2026\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,734 \n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal 2027\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5,250 \n\n&#160;\n\nThereafter\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n50,000 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n76,234 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSenior Notes\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes listed in the above table except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.\n\nThe senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation including the Revolving Credit Agreement and Bridge Credit Agreement, each as described further below. All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes, any future borrowings pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement and borrowings made on June 8, 2022 under the Bridge Credit Agreement, and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at May 31, 2022.\n\nCredit Agreements\n\nIn March 2022, we entered into the following two credit agreements:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\na $ 6.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement), which provides for an unsecured $ 6.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) to be used for our working capital purposes and for other general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the Revolving Facility during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement. All amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement will become due on March 8, 2027 , unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events). Interest is based on either (a) a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-based formula plus a margin of 87.5 basis points to 150.0 basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin of 0.0 basis point to 50.0 basis points, depending on the same such credit rating, each as set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\na $ 15.7 billion delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the Bridge Credit Agreement), which provides for an unsecured $ 15.7 billion, 364 -day term loan commitment (the Bridge Facility), subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. The Bridge Credit Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, net cash proceeds received by us from certain debt and equity issuances shall result in mandatory prepayments or commitment reductions under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The proceeds of borrowings under the Bridge Facility were used to finance the acquisition of Cerner, our refinancing of indebtedness in connection with such acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. All amounts borrowed under the Bridge Credit Agreement will become due on March 7, 2023 , unless settled earlier pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Credit Agreement. Interest is based on either (a) a Term SOFR-based formula plus a margin of 100.0 basis points to 137.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin of 0.0 basis point to 37.5 basis points, depending on the same such credit rating, each as set forth in the Bridge Credit Agreement. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNo amounts were outstanding pursuant to either of the credit agreements as of May 31, 2022. On June 8, 2022, we drew down the full amount of the Bridge Credit Agreement to finance the acquisition of Cerner.\n\nEach of the abovementioned credit agreements contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including the requirement that the ratio of &#8220;Consolidated EBITDA&#8221; to &#8220;Consolidated Net Interest Expense&#8221; (each term as defined in the respective credit agreements) of Oracle and its subsidiaries shall not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter during the period that the credit agreement is effective. If an event of default occurs under one of the credit agreements and is not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the applicable credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments under that agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the two credit agreements&#8217; covenants as of May 31, 2022.\n\nCommercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes\n\nOur existing $ 3.0 billion commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws pursuant to dealer agreements with various banks and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. As of May 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper notes.\n\n##TABLE_START 8. \n\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2022 Oracle Restructuring Plan\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2022 Restructuring Plan). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, our management supplemented the 2022 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expect to take. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2022 Restructuring Plan are up to $ 392 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. We recorded $ 223 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2022 Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2022 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $ 169 million through the end of fiscal 2023. Any changes to the estimates or timing of executing the 2022 Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations.\n\nFiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan\n\nDuring fiscal 2019, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2019 Restructuring Plan). In fiscal 2021, our management supplemented the 2019 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expected to take.

We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies, perform final assemblies and perform testing of our hardware products. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts disclosed below.

To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements.

Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.\n\nWe occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, among others, guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START 1 1 . \n\nSTOCKHOLDERS&#8217; (DEFICIT) EQUITY \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCommon Stock Repurchases\n\nOur Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On December 9, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $ 10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2022, approximately $ 9.4 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 185.8 million shares for $ 16.2 billion (including 0.3 million shares for $ 19 million that were repurchased but not settled) , 329.2 million shares for $ 21.0 billion, and 361.0 million shares for $ 19.2 billion in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, under the stock repurchase program. \n\nOur stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\n\nDividends on Common Stock\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $ 1.28 , $ 1.04 and $ 0.96 per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period.\n\nIn June 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 26, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 12, 2022 . Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n\nThe following table summarizes, as of each balance sheet date, the components of our AOCL, net of income taxes:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMay 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nForeign currency translation losses\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 1,482 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 775 \n\n)\n\nUnrealized losses on defined benefit plans, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 210 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 400 \n\n)\n\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 1,692 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 1,175 \n\n)\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 1 2 . \n\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nStock-Based Compensation Plans \n\nStock Plans \n\nIn fiscal 2021, we adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan to replace the Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restricted stock-based awards, non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligible employees, officers and directors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. In fiscal 2022, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan and, together with the 2000 Plan, the Plans), which increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2020 Plan by 300 million shares.\n\nThe total number of shares authorized under the 2020 Plan is (i) 390 million shares, plus (ii) the number of shares that were unissued and available for grant under the 2000 Plan as of the date that the 2020 Plan was originally adopted, plus (iii) the number of shares granted and outstanding as of the date that the 2020 Plan was originally adopted which would have been available again for issuance under the terms of the 2000 Plan had the 2020 Plan not been adopted. Under the 2020 Plan, for each share granted as a full value award in the form of a restricted stock unit (RSU) or a performance-based restricted stock award (PSU), an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, 125 million unvested RSUs, 36 million performance-based stock options (PSOs), of which 6 million shares were vested, and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase 60 million shares of common stock, of which 59 million shares were vested, were outstanding under the Plans. Approximately 371 million shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2020 Plan as of May 31, 2022. To date, we have not issued any stock options under the 2020 Plan or any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans.\n\nThe vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board. RSUs generally require service-based vesting of 25 % annually over four years . SOs were previously granted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. \n\nPSOs granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consisted of seven numerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially could vest. One tranche, which was based solely on the attainment of a market-based metric, was achieved and vested in fiscal 2022. Each of the remaining six tranches requires the attainment of both a performance metric and a market capitalization metric by May 31, 2022, which was subsequently extended by three additional fiscal years to May 31, 2025 via an amendment approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board during fiscal 2022. If any of the remaining operational and market capitalization performance goals are achieved before May 31, 2025 additional tranches may vest, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board certifies that performance has been achieved. Upon amendment of the PSOs in fiscal 2022, we estimated the revised fair values of the six unvested tranches of the PSOs using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. We are recognizing incremental stock-based compensation expense related to these amended awards for any of the remaining unvested tranches that are probable of achievement over the longer of the (a) estimated implicit service period for performance-metric achievement, or (b) derived service period for market-based metric achievement. Stock-based compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period when such a determination is made. We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement as of the amendment date to be approximately three to four years .\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nIn connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company&#8217;s respective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the Plans . These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed or substituted generally retain ed all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 202 2 , stock options to purchase approximately 485,000 shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed. \n\nIn fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors&#8217; Stock Plan (the Directors&#8217; Plan), which provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors&#8217; Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the Directors&#8217; Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four year s, and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. Currently, we only grant RSUs that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors&#8217; Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors&#8217; Plan. In April 2020, the Compensation Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic RSU grants to each non-employee director from $ 400,000 to $ 350,000 and eliminated all equity grants for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2022, approximately 59,000 unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 474,000 shares of common stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors&#8217; Plan. As of May 31, 2022, approximately 1 million shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.\n\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans for our last three fiscal years ended May 31, 2022:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRestricted Stock-Based Awards Outstanding\n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions, except fair value)\n\n&#160;\n\nNumber of\n\nShares\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-Average\n\nGrant Date Fair Value\n\n&#160;\n\nBalance, May 31, 2019\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n43.01 \n\n&#160;\n\nGranted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n53.38 \n\n&#160;\n\nVested and issued\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 34 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n42.67 \n\n&#160;\n\nCanceled\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 14 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n46.81 \n\n&#160;\n\nBalance, May 31, 2020\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n48.36 \n\n&#160;\n\nGranted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n54.95 \n\n&#160;\n\nVested and issued\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 34 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n46.88 \n\n&#160;\n\nCanceled\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 11 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n50.40 \n\n&#160;\n\nBalance, May 31, 2021\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n51.87 \n\n&#160;\n\nGranted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n85.07 \n\n&#160;\n\nVested and issued\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 38 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n50.52 \n\n&#160;\n\nCanceled\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 9 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n63.25 \n\n&#160;\n\nBalance, May 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n68.34 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe total grant date fair values of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 1.9 billion, $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.5 billion, respectively.

The total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $ 3.7 billion for each of fiscal 2022 and 2021 and $ 2.9 billion for fiscal 2020. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $ 843 million, $ 842 million and $ 638 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95 % of the fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2022, 39 million shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued approximately 2 million shares in each of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, under the Purchase Plan. The Compensation Committee last amended the Purchase Plan on May 3, 2022. \n\nDefined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans \n\nWe offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $ 412 million, $ 380 million and $ 376 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nIn the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up to 40 % of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50 % up to 6 % of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $ 164 million, $ 150 million and $ 152 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $ 756 million and approximately $ 813 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $ 67 million, $ 105 million and $ 97 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status, which is substantially included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets) of our defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2022 were $ 1.1 billion and $ 580 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2021 were $ 1.4 billion and $ 889 million, respectively.\n\n##TABLE_START 1 3 . \n\nINCOME TAXES \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income and losses earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Our (provision for) benefit from income taxes varied from that computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income. In addition, for fiscal 2021, our benefit from income taxes varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to a total net deferred tax benefit of $ 2.3 billion as a result of a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights.\n\nIn November 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the &#8220;Build Back Better Act&#8221; budget reconciliation bill (the Bill). To date, the Bill has failed to advance in the Senate. If the Bill as currently drafted (or a modified version containing similar revenue provisions) were enacted, it would substantially increase U.S. taxes on corporations, including, among other changes, raising the level of U.S. tax on profits earned outside the U.S. and further restricting the deductibility of interest expense. Such changes, if enacted, likely would have a material adverse impact on our future tax liabilities and consolidated financial results. \n\nThe following is a geographical breakdown of income before income taxes:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDomestic\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 629 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,375 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,890 \n\n&#160;\n\nForeign\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8,278 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8,624 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8,173 \n\n&#160;\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n7,649 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12,999 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n12,063 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe (provision for) benefit from income taxes consisted of the following:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent provision:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFederal\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 709 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 516 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 1,616 \n\n)\n\nState\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 186 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 233 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 19 \n\n)\n\nForeign\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 1,183 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 929 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 1,144 \n\n)\n\nTotal current provision\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 2,078 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 1,678 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 2,779 \n\n)\n\nDeferred benefit:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFederal\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,661 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 8,631 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nState\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 50 \n\n)\n\nForeign\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 654 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10,979 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 82 \n\n)\n\nTotal deferred benefit\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,146 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,425 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal (provision for) benefit from income taxes\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 932 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 1,928 \n\n)\n\nEffective income tax expense (benefit) rate\n\n&#160;\n\n12.2 %\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 5.7 %)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n16.0 %\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe (provision for) benefit from income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to our income before income taxes as follows:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nU.S. federal statutory tax rate\n\n&#160;\n\n21.0 %\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n21.0 %\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n21.0 %\n\n&#160;\n\nTax provision at statutory rate\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 1,606 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 2,730 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 2,533 \n\n)\n\nForeign earnings at other than United States rates\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNet impact of intra-entity IP transfer\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;

At May 31, 2022, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $ 7.9 billion. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2022, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $ 1.5 billion.\n\nOur net deferred tax assets were $ 6.8 billion and $ 5.8 billion as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change. \n\nThe valuation allowance was $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.5 billion as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2022 and 2021 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nsubsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first . \n\nAt May 31, 2022, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 446 million, which are subject to limitation on their utilization. Approximately $ 372 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $ 74 million of these federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.8 billion at May 31, 2022, which expire between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2042 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.9 billion at May 31, 2022, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $ 1.8 billion of these foreign net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $ 53 million, expire between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2041. At May 31, 2022, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of approximately $ 193 million, which expire in fiscal 2026. We had state capital loss carryforwards of approximately $ 366 million, which expire between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2036. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 1.3 billion at May 31, 2022, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $ 854 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $ 407 million, expire in various years between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2042.\n\nWe classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our (provision for) benefit from income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $ 93 million, $ 166 million and $ 202 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued were $ 1.6 billion as of May 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nDomestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2020. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include issues related to transfer pricing, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, research and development credits, state economic nexus, and qualification as a state manufacturer. With respect to all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2022, our gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $ 994 million ($ 825 million net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2011 and, with some exceptions, we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nInternationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining or have examined returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2021. Many of the relevant tax years are at an advanced stage in examination or subsequent controversy resolution processes, the most significant of which include issues related to transfer pricing and withholding tax. The manner in which those issues are resolved and the timing thereof could potentially result in a range of decreases or increases in our unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. We believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2022, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $ 287 million ($ 109 million net of offsetting tax benefits). We also believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2022, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could increase in the next 12 months by as much as $ 869 million ($ 227 million net of offsetting US tax benefits). With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.\n\nWe are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Spain, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.\n\nWe believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof.\n\n##TABLE_START 1 4 . \n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nASC 280, Segment Reporting , establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer. We are organized by line of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. The tabular information below presents financial information that is provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company&#8217;s performance and allocating company resources. \n\nWe have three businesses&#8212;cloud and license, hardware and services&#8212;each of which is comprised of a single operating segment. All three of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.\n\nOur cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings&#59; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nrelated technical support services over the contractual term. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each fiscal year, our cloud and license business&#8217; contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts . \n\nOur hardware business provides infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also offers hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services that are typically delivered and recognized ratably over the contractual term. \n\nOur services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nWe do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.\n\nThe following table presents summary results for each of our three businesses for each of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCloud and license:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n36,052 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n34,101 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n32,523 \n\n&#160;\n\nCloud services and license support expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,915 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,133 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,803 \n\n&#160;\n\nSales and marketing expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n7,054 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6,799 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n7,159 \n\n&#160;\n\nMargin (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n24,083 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n23,169 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n21,561 \n\n&#160;\n\nHardware:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,183 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,359 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,443 \n\n&#160;\n\nHardware products and support expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,084 \n\n&#160;\n\nSales and marketing expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMargin (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,878 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,026 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,903 \n\n&#160;\n\nServices:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,205 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,021 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,106 \n\n&#160;\n\nServices expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,539 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,393 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,656 \n\n&#160;\n\nMargin (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nTotals:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n42,440 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n40,481 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n39,072 \n\n&#160;\n\nExpenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n15,813 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n14,658 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n15,158 \n\n&#160;\n\nMargin (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n26,627 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n25,823 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n23,914 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nCloud and license revenues and total revenues presented for management reporting for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 included revenues related to cloud and license obligations that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations due to business combination accounting rules that were applicable to acquisitions closed prior to fiscal 2022.

The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP&#8217;s Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 (the HP Settlement Agreement), resolving litigation between HP and one of Oracle&#8217;s former CEOs who had previously acted as HP&#8217;s chief executive officer and chairman of HP&#8217;s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties&#8217; rights and obligations under the HP Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.\n\nAfter a bench trial on the meaning of the HP Settlement Agreement, the court found that the HP Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HP&#8217;s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP. The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its cross-claims. The jury awarded HP $ 3.0 billion in damages. Under the court&#8217;s rulings, HP is entitled to post-judgment interest, but not pre-judgment interest, on this award.\n\nAfter the trial court denied Oracle&#8217;s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial court&#8217;s denial of pre-judgment interest. Oral argument was held on May 27, 2021. On June 14, 2021, the Court of Appeal affirmed both the judgment against Oracle noted above, and the denial of pre-judgment interest. On June 29, 2021, Oracle filed a Petition for Rehearing with the Court of Appeal, which was denied on July 8, 2021. On July 26, 2021, Oracle filed a Petition for Review with the California Supreme Court, which was denied on September 29, 2021.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, Oracle remitted the entirety of the $ 3.0 billion judgment and related $ 1.7 billion of accrued post-judgment interest and awarded costs and recorded such amounts as acquisition related and other expenses as presented per our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nOn January 27, 2022, Oracle filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, which was denied on May 16, 2022. This matter is now concluded.\n\nDerivative Litigation Concerning Oracle&#8217;s NetSuite Acquisition\n\nOn May 3 and July 18, 2017, two alleged stockholders filed separate derivative lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, purportedly on Oracle&#8217;s behalf. Thereafter, the court consolidated the two derivative cases and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The consolidated lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. The complaint sought (and the operative complaint continues to seek) declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied on March 19, 2018.\n\nOn May 4, 2018, our Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-employee directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiff should be allowed to proceed with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had fulfilled its duties and obligations, the Board withdrew the SLC&#8217;s authority, except that the SLC maintained certain authority to respond to discovery requests in the litigation.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nAfter plaintiff filed the July 18, 2017 complaint, an additional plaintiff joined the case. Plaintiffs filed several amended complaints, and filed their most recent amended complaint on December 11, 2020. The operative complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former Chief Executive Officer who passed away on October 18, 2019), and two other members of our Board of Directors. Oracle is named as a nominal defendant. On December 11, 2020, the estate of Mark Hurd and the two other members of our Board of Directors moved to dismiss this complaint, and a hearing on this motion was held on February 16, 2021. On June 21, 2021, the court granted this motion as to the estate of Mark Hurd and one Board member and denied the motion as to the other Board member, who filed an answer to the complaint on August 9, 2021. On December 28, 2020, our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, and Oracle as a nominal defendant filed answers to the operative complaint. \n\nExpert discovery has concluded. On December 23, 2021, the Board member defendant brought a motion for summary judgment, and on May 20, 2022, the court granted this motion in part and denied this motion in part. This Board member remains a defendant in this case. Trial is scheduled to commence on July 18, 2022.\n\nWhile Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle&#8217;s Cloud Business\n\nOn August 10, 2018, a putative class action, brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us, our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, two other Oracle executives, and one former Oracle executive. As noted above, Mr. Hurd, one of our then-two Chief Executive Officers, passed away on October 18, 2019. On March 8, 2019, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants made or are responsible for false and misleading statements regarding Oracle&#8217;s cloud business. Plaintiff further alleges that the former Oracle executive engaged in insider trading. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs, and unspecified declaratory/injunctive relief. On April 19, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff&#8217;s amended complaint. On December 17, 2019, the court granted this motion, giving plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint, which plaintiff filed on February 17, 2020. On April 23, 2020, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and the court held a hearing on this motion on September 24, 2020. On March 22, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part this motion. The court dismissed the action as to one Oracle executive and the former Oracle executive. The court permitted plaintiff to proceed with only a narrow omissions theory against the remaining defendants. On April 21, 2021, defendants filed an answer to the complaint. On October 8, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which the court granted on May 9, 2022. On May 23, 2022, defendants filed a petition in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to appeal the court&#8217;s order granting class certification, and plaintiffs filed an opposition on June 2, 2022. On June 3, 2022, the court &#8220;So Ordered&#8221; a stipulation by the parties, which vacated all dates in this case because the parties had reached an agreement to settle this action, subject to the court&#8217;s approval. On June 8, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted defendants&#8217; unopposed motion to stay the petition for permission to appeal in light of the proposed settlement.\n\nOn February 12 and May 8, 2019, two stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The cases were consolidated, and on July 8, 2019, a single plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. The consolidated complaint brought various claims relating to the 10b-5 class action described immediately above. The parties agreed to stay the derivative case pending resolution of defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the securities case, which the court granted in part and denied in part on March 22, 2021.\n\nPlaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 4, 2021. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle&#8217;s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our Chief Executive Officer, and the estate of Mark Hurd. Plaintiff claims that the alleged actions described in the class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and that defendants violated their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith, loyalty, and due care by \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212;(Continued) \n\nMay 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nfailing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiff also brings derivative claims for violations of federal securities laws. Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants are liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, damages, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs, and unspecified relief. On Jun e 14, 2021, the court &#8220;so ordered&#8221; a stipulation from the parties, staying this case pending resolution of the 10b-5 action . \n\nWhile Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe these matters will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n\nOther Litigation\n\nWe are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.\n\n##TABLE_START 17. \n\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAcquisition of Cerner Corporation and Related Borrowings\n\nOn June 8, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the tender offer and applicable Delaware law, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cerner&#8217;s common stock and effectuated the merger of Cerner with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle, and Cerner became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these consolidated financial statements and the financial results of Cerner will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Refer to Note 2 above for more information about our acquisition of Cerner.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of Cerner:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nwe borrowed $ 15.7 billion on June 8, 2022 pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement.
