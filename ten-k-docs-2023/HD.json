We offer our customers a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, d&#233;cor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products. We also provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we operated 2,322 stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. When we refer to &#8220;The Home Depot,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. \n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate headquarters) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770) 433-8211. \n\nOUR BUSINESS \n\nOUR STRATEGY \n\nThe retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years, with customer expectations constantly evolving. In fiscal 2022, we continued to operate with agility to meet the challenges created by a fluid domestic and global business environment, including supply chain disruptions, tight labor market conditions, and ongoing inflationary pressures. Our ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers was due in significant part to our investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum of these investments and continue to invest in our business in support of the following goals: \n\n&#8226; We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement; \n\n&#8226; We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement; and \n\n&#8226; We intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. \n\nWe believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliver value to our shareholders. We are steadfast in this commitment, while also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed by the needs of our other stakeholders, including our customers, associates, supplier partners, and communities, creates value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. \n\nDELIVER SHAREHOLDER VALUE \n\nWe deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles are as follows: \n\n&#8226; First, we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market. \n\n&#8226; Second, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to pay a quarterly dividend, which we intend to increase as we grow earnings. \n\n&#8226; Third, after reinvesting in our business and paying our dividend, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, we invested $3.1 billion in capital expenditures to support our business, advance our goals, and continue to build an interconnected customer experience. We also focused on driving productivity throughout the business to lower our costs. The combination of reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales and supporting productivity to lower costs creates what we refer to as a virtuous cycle, which has allowed us to improve the customer experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver shareholder value. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases. Our capital allocation is discussed further in Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 1 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nOUR CUSTOMERS \n\nWe serve two primary customer groups &#8212; consumers (including both DIY and DIFM customers) and professional customers &#8212; and have developed varying approaches to meet their diverse needs: \n\nDIY Customers \n\nThese customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops both to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. \n\nProfessional Customers (or &#8220;Pros&#8221;) \n\nThese customers are primarily professional renovators/remodelers, general contractors, maintenance professionals, handymen, property managers, building service contractors and specialty tradespeople, such as electricians, plumbers and painters. These customers build, renovate, remodel, repair, and maintain residential properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties, and commercial facilities, including education, healthcare, government, institutional, and office buildings. \n\nWe have a number of initiatives designed to drive growth with our Pros, including a customized online experience, a dedicated sales force, an extensive delivery network, our Pro Xtra loyalty program, enhanced credit offerings, and inventory management programs. Building on our historical strength as a destination for urgent purchase needs, we are investing in capabilities that will help us better serve our Pros&#8217; planned purchase needs (in-store or via our dedicated sales team), including our expanded supply chain capabilities and advance ordering through our interconnected digital platforms. We believe that focusing on meeting the Pros&#8217; planned purchase needs, particularly for larger renovator/remodeler Pros, will help us drive growth and deliver value to our shareholders. \n\nWe extended our reach in the MRO marketplace with our fiscal 2020 acquisition of HD Supply, a leading national distributor and provider of MRO products and related value-added services to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and government housing facilities, among others, and in fiscal 2021 we integrated our legacy Interline Brands business into HD Supply. Our MRO operations use a distribution center-based model that sells products primarily through a professional sales force and through e-commerce platforms and print catalogs. \n\nWe recognize the great value our Pros provide to their clients, and we strive to make their jobs easier and help them grow their businesses. We believe that investments aimed at deepening our relationships with our Pros are yielding increased engagement and will continue to translate into incremental sales to these customers. \n\nDIFM Customers \n\nIntersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers. These customers are typically homeowners who use Pros to complete their project or installation. Currently, we offer installation services in a variety of categories, such as flooring, water heaters, bath, garage doors, cabinets, cabinet makeovers, countertops, sheds, furnaces and central air systems, and windows. DIFM customers can purchase these services in our stores, online, or in their homes through in-home consultations. In addition to serving our DIFM customer needs, we believe our focus on the Pros who perform services for these customers helps us drive higher product sales. \n\nOUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES \n\nA typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 items during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary products. Our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites and mobile applications, including homedepot.com, our primary website; homedepot.ca and homedepot.com.mx, our websites in Canada and Mexico; hdsupply.com, our website for our MRO products and related services; blinds.com, our online site for custom window coverings; and thecompanystore.com, our online site featuring textiles and d&#233;cor products. \n\nWe believe our merchandising organization is a key competitive advantage, delivering product innovation, assortment and value, which reinforces our position as the product authority in home improvement. In fiscal 2022, we continued to invest in merchandising resets in our stores to refine assortments, optimize space productivity, introduce innovative new products to our customers, and improve visual merchandising to drive a better shopping experience. At the same time, we remain focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. To help our merchandising organization keep pace with changing customer expectations and increasing desire for innovation, localization, and personalization, we are continuing to invest in tools to better leverage our data and drive a deeper level of collaboration with our supplier partners. As a result, we have continued to focus on enhanced \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 2 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nmerchandising information technology tools to help us: (1) build an interconnected shopping experience that is tailored to our customers&#8217; shopping intent and location; (2) provide the best value in the market; and (3) optimize our product assortments. Our merchandising team leverages technology and works closely with our inventory and supply chain teams, as well as our supplier partners, to manage our assortments, drive innovation, and adjust inventory levels to respond to fluctuations in demand, which helped us navigate the challenges of continuing global supply chain disruption in fiscal 2022. As cost pressures have risen in several product categories in the current environment, our tools have helped our merchandising, finance and data analytics teams as they work with our supplier partners to manage these pressures. \n\nTo complement our merchandising efforts, we offer a number of services for our customers, including installation services for our DIY and DIFM customers, as noted above. We also provide tool and equipment rentals at locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations (including piloting rental locations in Mexico), more tools, and better technology. \n\nSourcing and Quality Assurance \n\nWe maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2022, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, compliance with local laws, health and safety, environmental laws and regulations, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance visits with non-Canada and non-U.S. suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2022 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com under &#8220;Responsibility &#62; Sourcing Responsibly,&#8221; provides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nOur business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot &#174; trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands such as HDX &#174; , Husky &#174; , Hampton Bay &#174; , Home Decorators Collection &#174; , Glacier Bay &#174; , Vigoro &#174; , Everbilt &#174; and Lifeproof &#174; . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services, and products, and we seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot&#8217;s portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands. \n\nCOMPETITION AND SEASONALITY \n\nOur industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, service providers, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases. These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online, and they include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d&#233;cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 3 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nproviders of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face. \n\nBoth in-store and online, we compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Our Pros also look for a dedicated sales team, competitive credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their planned purchase needs. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options, customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more fully under &#8220;Our Supply Chain&#8221; below. \n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, as we move into the spring season in the regions in which we operate. \n\nINTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE \n\nWe continue to enhance our capabilities to provide our customers with a frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores, online, on the job site, and in their homes, focusing on continued investments in our website and mobile apps to enhance the digital customer experience. \n\nDigital Experience \n\nEnhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who often research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities. \n\nA significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on mobile devices. Mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their digital interactions. As a result, we have made investments to our digital properties to improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We have also enhanced the &#8220;shopability&#8221; of an online product by including more information on the product&#8217;s landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, as well as various fulfillment options. We believe our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content, speed to checkout, and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth. \n\nFurther, we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific transaction; rather, we believe it encompasses an entire journey from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care and support. Customers expect more personalized messaging, so we are continuing to focus on connecting marketing activities with the online and in-store experiences to create seamless engagement across channels. From the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product know-how, we continue to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important to them today. \n\nStore Experience \n\nOur stores remain the hub of our business, and we continue to invest to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increased convenience and speed of checkout. In fiscal 2022, we continued to leverage the investments made in our stores over the past several years to operate effectively and meet changing customer expectations. These investments include wayfinding signage and store refresh packages; self-service lockers, online order storage areas at front entrances and curbside pickup to provide convenient pickup options for online orders; electronic shelf label capabilities; and the re-design of front-end areas, including reconfigured service desks, improved layouts in checkout areas, and expanded and enhanced self-checkout options. To improve the customer&#8217;s experience in our stores, we have also empowered our customers with additional self-help tools, including mobile app-enabled store navigation. Our app provides store-specific maps, which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices. We believe these investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, and we will continue to invest to improve the customer experience going forward. \n\nInvesting in Associate Productivity. We continually strive to improve our store operations for our associates. Our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. To this end, we have continued to focus our efforts in such areas as optimizing product flow to decrease the amount of time a store associate spends locating product and to improve on-shelf product availability; creating a \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 4 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nsimpler order management system; expanding in-aisle, real-time mobile learning tools for our associates&#8217; own development and to assist with customer questions; and using labor model tools to better align associate activity with customer needs. For several years, our associates have used web-enabled handheld devices to help them more efficiently meet the needs of the business and serve customers. In fiscal 2022, we began rolling out the next generation of digital phones to our stores, which we call &#8220;hdPhones,&#8221; so that each associate will have a digital device during their shift. The new devices offer enhanced functionality to allow associates to readily query inventory, access applications that support customer service, and drive on-shelf availability of product. \n\nInvesting in Safety. We are committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. We empower trained EH&#38;S associates to evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EH&#38;S policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Common program elements include daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate&#8217;s role and responsibilities; and awareness, communication and recognition programs designed to drive operational awareness and an understanding of EH&#38;S matters. \n\nOUR SUPPLY CHAIN \n\nWe continue to focus on building best-in-class competitive advantages in our supply chain to be responsive to our customers&#8217; expectations for how, when and where they choose to receive our products and services. As part of enhancing the interconnected shopping experience, we continue to invest in expanding our supply chain network, with the goal of achieving the fastest, most efficient and most reliable delivery capabilities in home improvement. Our efforts are focused on ensuring product availability and increasing the speed and reliability of delivery for our customers while managing our costs. Our supply chain investments have helped us to operate effectively and meet our customers&#8217; needs throughout the challenging environment over the past few years. \n\nWe centrally forecast and replenish the vast majority of our store products through sophisticated inventory management systems and utilize our network of distribution centers to serve both our stores&#8217; and customers&#8217; needs. Our supply chain includes multiple distribution center platforms in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on types of products, location, transportation, and delivery requirements. These platforms include rapid deployment centers, stocking distribution centers, bulk distribution centers, and direct fulfillment centers, among others. As part of the expansion of our supply chain, we have invested to further automate and mechanize our rapid deployment center network to drive efficiency and faster movement of product. \n\nWe are also continuing to expand our fulfillment network, investing in a significant number of new fulfillment facilities to drive speed and reliability of delivery for our customers and to help us ultimately meet our goal of reaching 90% of the U.S. population with same or next day delivery for extended home improvement product offerings, including big and bulky products. These facilities include omni-channel fulfillment centers, which deliver product directly to customers, and market delivery operations, which function as local hubs to consolidate freight for dispatch to customers for the final mile of delivery, with a focus on appliances. In fiscal 2022, we realized our goal to control more of our appliance delivery end-to-end and began managing all of our appliance delivery volume through our market delivery operations. We have also added flatbed distribution centers, which handle large items like lumber and building materials that are transported on flatbed trucks. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we have opened a number of additional fulfillment facilities, and we will continue to build out our fulfillment network to support our business. Our network is designed to create a competitive advantage with unique, industry-leading capabilities for home improvement needs for both Pros and consumers. \n\nIn addition to our distribution and fulfillment centers, we leverage our stores as a network of convenient customer pickup, return, and delivery fulfillment locations. Our premium real estate footprint provides a distinct structural and competitive advantage. For customers who shop online and wish to pick up or return merchandise at, or have merchandise delivered from, our stores, we have implemented four interconnected retail programs: BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS, and BORIS. We also provide curbside pickup to complement our BOPIS offerings, in addition to the self-service lockers at the front entrance of many of our stores. We also offer express car and van delivery service that covers over 80% of the U.S. population. For fiscal 2022, approximately 50% of our U.S. online orders were fulfilled through a store. We also continue to focus on developing new capabilities to improve both efficiency and customer experience in our store delivery program. Our strategic intent is to have a portfolio of efficient, timely and reliable sources and methods of delivery to choose from, optimizing order fulfillment and delivery based on customer needs, inventory locations and available transportation options. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 5 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \n\nWe view environmental, social and governance matters through the lens of our business, with an understanding that if we support our associates, our customers, our supplier partners, and the communities we serve, we also support our business and create long-term value for our shareholders. As a result, we believe that ESG is fundamentally embedded in our operations and culture. We organize our efforts around three pillars: (1) Focus on Our People, (2) Operate Sustainably, and (3) Strengthen Our Communities. Highlights of each of these pillars are set forth below. For further information on our three pillars and other ESG-related matters, see our annual ESG Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility. \n\nFocus on Our People \n\nOur culture and our associates provide intangible and hard-to-replicate competitive advantages, which have been key to helping us navigate challenging market conditions. Our associates are essential to providing the experience and service that our customers demand. To preserve and protect that customer experience, we focus on cultivating a compelling associate experience, which we believe supports our ability to attract and retain our associates. This includes investing in competitive wages and benefits while also providing the culture, tools, training and development opportunities that make working at The Home Depot an enjoyable and rewarding experience. These actions are the foundation of our key tenets of putting customers first and taking care of our associates. \n\nCulture and Values. The Home Depot has a strong commitment to ethics and integrity, and we are a values- and culture-centric business. Our commitment to our core values drives our approach to human capital management. Our culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy represented by the inverted pyramid, which puts primary importance on our customers and our associates by positioning them at the top, with senior management at the base in a support role. We bring our culture to life through our core values, which serve as the foundation of our business and as the guiding principles behind the decisions we make every day. \n\nOur values also guide our efforts to create an environment that will help us attract and retain skilled associates in the competitive marketplace for talent. We empower our associates to deliver a superior customer experience by living our values, and we position our associates to embody our core values by integrating the importance of our culture into ongoing development programs, performance management practices, and rewards programs. Leaders participate in programs designed to build and strengthen our culture, such as training on leadership skills, cross-functional collaboration, inclusiveness, and associate engagement, and all associates receive annual training on unconscious bias. Our core values are at the root of our human capital management programs. \n\nOur Workforce. At the end of fiscal 2022, we employed approximately 471,600 associates, of whom approximately 46,500 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly basis. Set forth below is the geographic makeup of our workforce: \n\n##TABLE_START Geographic Location Number of Associates % of Total Workforce United States 418,900 88.8% Canada 34,500 7.3% Mexico 17,900 3.8% \n\nOther (1) \n\n300 0.1% Total 471,600 100% ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n(1) Includes associates in our sourcing organization located in China, Vietnam, India, Italy, Poland and Turkey. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 6 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nTalent Attraction and Development. As we attract and hire new associates, we strive to create a customer-like experience for jobseekers as they progress through the steps of our recruiting process by focusing on speed and personalization. We employ targeted marketing practices through our careers website, which personalizes the user&#8217;s experience based on jobseeker location and searching behavior. Jobseekers can also apply for roles from anywhere using desktop or mobile devices. Once a jobseeker has applied for a role and has been selected to move forward in the recruiting process, we provide self-service by allowing candidates to schedule or reschedule pre-hire activities directly from their mobile device. Lastly, we created a quick hiring process for candidates by leveraging job-matching automation that matches candidates to jobs that fit their needs. \n\nWe offer all of our associates the opportunity to benefit from robust development opportunities. Our Home Depot University, or &#8220;HDU,&#8221; program, is a key part of this development, offering relevant content through multiple platforms, including instructor-led classes, e-learning, mobile learning, and additional online resources. We invest in ongoing growth and development by integrating our culture and values into our performance management practices, providing coaching through continuous leader support, and empowering our associates to learn new skills at their own pace through mobile applications our associates can access at any time. We equip our leaders with the tools they need to develop themselves and their teams through several programs designed to help them lead inclusively, empower their teams, and serve as mentors for our associates. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, we supported both associate development and engagement by starting the year with a new store leadership structure. We created new management positions in our stores focused on the customer service experience, increasing the number of managers on the floor at any given time. This new structure frees up time for other store leaders to devote to associate training and development. The result is an improved customer and associate experience, while also providing new career paths for associates. \n\nAssociate Engagement. Associate engagement is the emotional commitment associates have to The Home Depot. It is vital to our culture and to our success. We create an engaging workplace by continuously listening to and acting on associate feedback. We provide several pulse check surveys to associates throughout the year that help us determine how emotionally connected those associates are to our customers, the Company, their jobs, fellow associates, and leaders. In addition, our annual Voice of the Associate survey, which includes all associates, serves as our primary means of gauging associates&#8217; level of engagement within their roles. We use the feedback from these surveys to help improve the overall associate experience. We also maintain a digital associate engagement platform that links associates with common interests and fuels connections to co-workers and Company leaders. Additionally, we have a number of programs to recognize stores and individual associates for exceptional customer service and demonstrating our core values. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion. Guided by our core values and grounded in our culture, we believe that having a diverse, equitable and inclusive Company is key to our success. We are focused on building a workplace and retail space that reflect the customers and communities we are proud to serve. We strive to maintain a Company where our associates are valued and respected and feel a sense of belonging in the workplace, so that they can provide the customer experience that supports our business. Our Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion supports our focus on associate diversity, supplier diversity, and engagement with our communities. Below is the fiscal 2022 diversity data for our U.S. associates: \n\n##TABLE_START Associate Population Race/Ethnicity Gender % Minority % White % Undisclosed % Female % Male % Undisclosed U.S. Workforce 48% 50% 2% 38% 62% 1% \n\nU.S. Managers &#38; Above (1) \n\n39% 60% 1% 35% 65% 0% U.S. Officers 26% 73% 2% 29% 69% 2% ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n(1) Does not include officers. \n\nNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. \n\nAs a Company, we have identified several priorities designed to guide our efforts to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion. We believe these associate-, supplier- and community-focused priorities will further enhance our customers&#8217; experience and make a sustainable difference within the workplace, marketplace, and community: \n\n&#8226; Associate Engagement \n\n&#9702; Increase diverse representation throughout our organization \n\n&#9702; Create an environment where every associate feels included and valued for who they are \n\n&#9702; Promote equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, development and advancement \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 7 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; Supplier Diversity \n\n&#9702; Increase use of and spend with diverse suppliers \n\n&#9702; Develop diverse suppliers by providing mentorship and sharing resources \n\n&#8226; Community Engagement \n\n&#9702; Partner with organizations on programs designed to close the wealth gap \n\n&#9702; Support programs that advance education for all \n\nCompensation and Benefits. Consistent with our core values, we take care of our people by offering competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits programs. We continuously make wage investments to ensure our compensation packages reflect the evolving circumstances across our markets, and our profit-sharing program for hourly associates provides semi-annual cash awards for performance against our business plan. We transitioned from the enhanced pay and benefits we provided for our associates in fiscal 2020 to alleviate some of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline, hourly associates, which we have continued to make since fiscal 2020. Our associates can take advantage of a range of benefits, including healthcare and wellness programs, vacation and leave of absence benefits including parental leave and paid sick/personal time off, a 401(k) match, our ESPPs, personal finance education and advisory services, assistance programs to help with managing personal and work-life challenges, family support programs, and educational assistance. \n\nOperate Sustainably \n\nWe have a long-standing and substantial commitment to sustainable business operations, understanding that if we make our operations more efficient and sustainable, we can support both our business and the environment. This philosophy extends from the products and services we offer to our customers; to our store construction, maintenance and operations; to our supply chain and packaging initiatives; to our ethical sourcing program. As we strive to operate sustainably, we have focused on efforts that help protect the climate, reduce our environmental impact, and source products responsibly, and we have set goals to drive progress in these areas. \n\nOur 2022 ESG Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility, includes more information on our goals, as well as specific initiatives we have in place to help achieve these goals. Below are highlights of our sustainability strategy. \n\nOur Environmental Goals. We currently have several goals to help address climate impact and reduce our environmental footprint: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Announced Goal Goal Date Status 2018 \n\nCleaning Products Chemical Reduction : Eliminate certain added chemicals from residential household cleaning products sold in-store or online by the end of fiscal 2022 \n\n2022 Complete (1) \n\nScience-Based Carbon Emissions Targets : Reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 2.1% per year, with the goal to achieve a 40% reduction by the end of fiscal 2030 and a 50% reduction by the end of fiscal 2035 \n\n2030; 2035 In Process 2019 \n\nRecyclable Packaging : Exclude expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film from the packaging of private-brand products we sell, replacing them with easier-to-recycle materials by the end of fiscal 2023 \n\n2023 In Process 2020 \n\nRenewable/Alternative Energy Sources : Produce or procure, on an annual basis, 335 megawatts of renewable or alternative energy by the end of fiscal 2025 \n\n2025 In Process 2021 \n\n100% Renewable Electricity : Produce or procure renewable electricity equivalent to the needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by the end of fiscal 2030 \n\n2030 In Process ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n(1) A de minimis number of suppliers are still in the process of reformulating and transitioning their product assortment. \n\nThese goals follow the completion of a number of previously announced goals, including goals related to reducing store electricity use, eliminating certain chemicals from products we sell, and helping customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and water use and save on electricity costs. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 8 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nOur Environmental Programs and Initiatives. In order to progress against our goals, we have a number of environmentally-focused programs and initiatives, including: \n\n&#8226; Store Operations and Renewable/Alternative Energy . We have reduced store energy consumption through initiatives such as LED lighting upgrades; installation of energy-efficient HVAC systems; participation in demand mitigation; on-site alternative or renewable energy projects such as fuel cells and solar panels; and contracts with off-site wind and solar power providers. We have continued to work toward our goal to produce or procure renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities by the end of fiscal 2030. We have also continued our focus on saving water, implementing smart irrigation systems capable of reducing irrigation-related water use in more than 500 U.S. stores. \n\n&#8226; Product Offerings. Through our Eco Actions TM program, we have helped our customers more easily identify products related to five areas: carbon emissions, circularity, responsible chemistry, sustainable forestry, and water use. Under our Eco Actions program, we sell ENERGY STAR &#174; certified appliances; WaterSense &#174; -labeled bath faucets, showerheads, aerators, toilets, and irrigation controllers; LED light bulbs; tankless water heaters; and many other products. These products, through proper use, help our customers save money on their utility bills and reduce their environmental impact. Through Eco Actions, we also provide customers with resources, such as project tutorials, to take individual action on environmental issues. \n\n&#8226; In-Store Recycling Programs. We offer customer-facing recycling programs in the U.S., including in-store recycling programs for compact fluorescent light bulbs, rechargeable batteries, and lead acid batteries. \n\n&#8226; Chemical Strategy. We are committed to increasing our assortment of products that meet high environmental standards, and we encourage our suppliers to invest in developing environmentally-innovative products. We periodically evaluate our Chemical Strategy to ensure our approach and goals are appropriate. \n\n&#8226; Sustainable Packaging. In addition to our goal related to eliminating EPS and PVC from our private-brand products, we are continually working with our suppliers to find ways to make product packaging more recyclable or simply use less materials, such as through the reduction of single-use plastics. \n\n&#8226; Supply Chain Optimization. Through our supply chain initiatives such as space sharing and optimization technology, we are working to maximize our use of every mile to make our supply chain more efficient. We also utilize hydrogen fuel cell technology in a number of our forklifts to make our supply chain even more environmentally responsible. \n\n&#8226; CDP Participation . We are a long-standing participant in the annual CDP Climate Change reporting process. CDP is an independent, international, not-for-profit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage, and share environmental information. In February 2023, we received a score of &#8220;B&#8221; from CDP. We have also announced that we plan to begin participating in CDP&#8217;s Forests reporting process. \n\n&#8226; Assessment of SBTi Goals . In fiscal 2021, we announced plans to adopt, by the end of fiscal 2023, new Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) goals to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in line with Paris Agreement goals. Adoption of SBTi goals would build on our current science-based goals to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 2.1% per year, to achieve a 40% reduction by the end of fiscal 2030 and a 50% reduction by the end of fiscal 2035. In fiscal 2022, we continued to work on evaluating potential SBTi goals. \n\nOver the past several years, our commitment to sustainable operations has resulted in a number of environmental awards and recognitions. In 2022, we received the following awards: an EPA WaterSense &#174; Partner of the Year Award for our commitment to offering and promoting water-efficient products; an EPA SmartWay High Performer Award, which recognized us as an industry leader in improving freight efficiency and environmental performance; an EPA Safer Choice Partner of the Year Award, which recognizes achievement in products with safer chemicals that furthers innovative source reduction; and an EPA ENERGY STAR &#174; Partner of the Year Award for our contribution to promoting energy efficiency. \n\nStrengthen our Communities \n\nOne of our core values is &#8220;Giving Back,&#8221; and we support our communities in a number of ways. The Home Depot Foundation focuses on improving the homes and lives of U.S. veterans, assisting communities affected by natural disasters, and training skilled tradespeople to fill the labor gap. The Company and The Home Depot Foundation are partnering with industry leaders on training programs to train the next generation of skilled tradespeople and help them find careers in the home improvement industry through our Path to Pro program, which includes a new career networking site to connect skilled tradespeople to industry Pros. Our Team Depot associate volunteers also extend \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 9 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nthe mission of the Home Depot Foundation in communities across the country, donating thousands of volunteer hours each year on a wide variety of projects. \n\nWe partner with diverse suppliers and organizations to further support our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. As noted above, our Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion partners with community organizations on programs designed to close the wealth gap and enhance education outcomes across underserved and underrepresented communities. To further advance diversity, equity and inclusion in our communities, we have a supplier diversity program through which we provide supplier development and other resources to our diverse suppliers, and in fiscal 2021 we launched a Tier II supplier diversity program that aims to drive more spending from our direct suppliers to diverse suppliers. In fiscal 2022, the Company joined the Billion Dollar Roundtable Inc., or BDR, a not-for-profit organization that promotes supplier diversity excellence and best practices. The BDR consists of U.S.-based corporations that spend $1.0 billion or more annually with minority- and woman-owned suppliers. We are working to cultivate a supplier base that creates long-lasting growth and mutual business success, while reflecting the diversity of our customers and strengthening the communities in which our customers and associates live. \n\nPlease see our 2022 ESG Report for additional information about our efforts to support the communities we serve. \n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION \n\nAs a company with both U.S. and international operations, we are subject to the laws of the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position as compared to prior periods. \n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION \n\nOur internet website is www.homedepot.com.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. \n\nSTRATEGIC RISKS \n\nStrong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. \n\nOur industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, service providers, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases. These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online, and they include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d&#233;cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face. \n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Our Pros also look for a dedicated sales team, competitive credit \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 10 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nand pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their planned purchase needs. Furthermore, customers are increasingly shopping online and seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including leveraging the momentum of our strategic investments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience. Failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery and pickup options could negatively impact our profit margins and the demand for our products. \n\nWe use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could adversely affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior interconnected customer experience or through maintenance of effective sales and marketing, advertising or promotional programs leveraging both our digital and physical platforms, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, we are operating in a highly inflationary environment. If inflation increases beyond our ability to control our related costs, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand, or it may adversely affect our ability to compete based on price. \n\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. \n\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; shifts in consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, public health issues (including pandemics and related impacts), natural disasters, or changes in the macroeconomic environment that impact our customers, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data, however, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security and customer expectations around data collection and use. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. Customer preferences and expectations related to sustainability of products and operations are also changing. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. \n\nCustomer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers routinely and increasingly use technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product reviews, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products, and new channels and tools to expand the customer experience appear and change rapidly. Our Pros also look for additional capabilities, including a dedicated sales team, competitive credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job lot quantities, particularly for their planned purchase needs. Once products are purchased, customers seek alternate options for delivery of those products, including advance ordering through digital platforms for Pros, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery and/or convenient pickup options. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the shopping and purchasing process by continuing to adjust and enhance the online and in-store customer experience as well as our delivery options. The coordinated operation of our network of physical stores, distribution facilities, and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy. We cannot guarantee that our current or future fulfillment options will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery or pickup times, options and costs. In addition, as our customers continue to leverage our enhanced interconnected shopping and fulfillment options, a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-selling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance. A greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment could also result in higher costs for delivery, potentially impacting our profit margins. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 11 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nFailure to provide a relevant or effective online customer experience in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment; or to otherwise timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. \n\nA positive brand and reputation are critical to our business success, and, if our brand and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, current and potential associates, suppliers, vendors, and shareholders, and, consequently, our business and results of operations or the price of our stock. \n\nOur brand and reputation are critical to attracting customers, current and potential associates, suppliers and vendors to do business with us. We must continue to manage and protect our brand and reputation. Negative incidents can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our brand and reputation; undermine our customers&#8217; confidence in us; reduce demand for our products and services; affect our ability to recruit, engage, motivate and retain associates; attract regulatory scrutiny; and impact our relationships with current and potential suppliers and vendors. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, governance, political, public policy, economic, geopolitical, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups. Customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company, including our products and services, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. Negative sentiment about the Company shared over social media, or misinformation from fraudulent accounts impersonating the Company, could impact our brand and reputation, whether or not it is based in fact. \n\nThe execution of initiatives to expand our supply chain and enhance the interconnected shopping experience could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. \n\nWe continue to invest in our interconnected retail strategy, including by making significant investments to expand our supply chain. These investments are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers; simplify customer interactions; provide our customers with a more interconnected shopping experience; better address Pro planned purchase needs; and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. Executing our interconnected retail strategy requires continual investment in our operations and information technology systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes, systems and support. Building out our supply chain also involves significant real estate projects as we expand our distribution network, requiring us to identify and secure available locations with appropriate characteristics needed to support the different types of facilities. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new online tools and services, implementing new technologies, implementing and restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact our profitability. \n\nIn addition, our stores are a key element of our interconnected retail strategy, serving as the hub of our customers&#8217; interconnected shopping experience. We have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. We also need to identify and secure available locations with appropriate characteristics for new stores to ensure we can continue to serve our customers effectively. Our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect or fully support an interconnected shopping experience. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as protect against loss or theft of our inventory (also called &#8220;shrink&#8221;), including as a result of organized retail crime. High rates of shrink, which we continue to experience, or an unsafe store environment, requires operational changes that may increase costs and adversely impact the customer and associate experience. \n\nOur investments to enhance our interconnected shopping experience and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 12 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nmight fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with certain suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. \n\nAs part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with certain suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. We have also developed relationships with certain suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers and generally carry higher margins than national brand products. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships, maintain favorable terms with current suppliers, or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results. \n\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions. \n\nWe regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies. We generally expect that these transactions will result in sales increases, cost savings, synergies, enhanced capabilities or various other benefits. Assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. For each of our acquisitions, we need to determine the appropriate level of integration of the target company&#8217;s products, services, associates, and information technology, financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, technology and cybersecurity systems, and operations and may make them more difficult to manage. Even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional risks and liabilities. Strategic transactions may also be subject to significant regulatory uncertainty. The changing enforcement landscape may result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated outcome of a transaction. Any failure in the execution of a strategic transaction or investment, our approach to the integration of an acquired asset or business, or achievement of synergies or other benefits could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS \n\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs. \n\nOur customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates and maintain a productive relationship with those associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including increased market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, employment, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics and expectations among the workforce; public health concerns; and our reputation within the labor market. We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions often have high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. We have faced and may continue to face additional challenges in recruiting and retaining associates due to wage pressure; flexible scheduling needs; disruption in the availability of childcare; challenges related to a remote or hybrid working environment for associates who work in our store support centers; and health and safety concerns. We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our associates from time to time and, if successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility and efficiency, and/or otherwise negatively impact our operations or reputation. These factors, together with growing competition among potential employers, have resulted in and may continue to result in increased salaries, benefits, or other employee-related \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 13 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\ncosts, and/or may impair our ability to recruit and retain associates, which could have an adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn addition, to execute our interconnected retail strategy, including our supply chain investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals, to implement our ongoing technology and other investments. The market for these professionals is very competitive. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits, including remote or hybrid work flexibility, that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract associates. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. \n\nAdditionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates is critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified associates, or manage leadership transitions successfully, our ability to effectively manage our strategy may be negatively impacted, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease, and our financial performance may be adversely affected. \n\nA failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. \n\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, process, retain, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data. Some of these systems are managed or provided by third-party service providers, including certain cloud platform providers. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of, and consistent access to, operational and financial data for information such as sales, customer data, supplier data, associate data, job applicant data, partner data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer service, and post-purchase matters. For these information technology systems, applications, and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems, applications or processes could impair, and on occasion have impaired, their effectiveness or could expose us to security risks. Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to and on occasion have experienced damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power and other critical infrastructure outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; data or security breaches; internal or external data theft or misuse; cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, smishing, vishing, spyware, denial of service attacks, and ransomware; responsive containment measures by us that may involve voluntarily taking systems offline; natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other extreme weather events; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines; military conflicts, acts of war, terrorism or civil unrest; other systems outages; inadequate or ineffective redundancy; and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. In addition, as more business activities have shifted online, and as many of our store support associates continue to work in a remote or hybrid environment, we face an increased risk due to the potential failure of internal or external information technology infrastructure as well as increased cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks. \n\nAlthough we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts are not always successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security; impact our ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems; be costly, time-consuming and resource-intensive to remedy; and adversely impact our reputation and relationship with our customers, suppliers, shareholders or regulators. \n\nIn addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other third-party service providers. These investments involve replacing existing systems, some of which are older, legacy systems that are less flexible and efficient, with successor systems; outsourcing certain technology and business processes to third-party service providers; making changes to existing systems, including the migration of applications to the cloud; maintaining or enhancing legacy systems that are not currently being replaced; or designing or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, failures in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. Any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, security failures, reputational harm, and increased costs that could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 14 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nDisruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. \n\nThrough our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms. We use our digital platforms as sales channels for our products and services, as methods of providing inspiration, and as sources of product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to help drive sales. We also have multiple online communities, digital platforms, and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. The retail industry is continually evolving and expanding, with a significant increase in sales initiated online and via mobile applications. We may not be successful at managing this increased volume and related delivery options without interruption in the future. Additionally, we must effectively respond to new developments and changing customer preferences with respect to a digital and interconnected experience. We continually seek to enhance all of our online and digital properties to provide a personalized, user-friendly interface for our customers. Disruptions, delays, failures or other performance issues with our customer-facing technology systems, either due to increased volume, system modifications, or other factors, or a failure of these systems to meet our or our customers&#8217; expectations, could impair the value they provide, adversely impact our sales, and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. \n\nDisruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the availability and distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business. \n\nDisruption within our logistics or supply chain network, such as the industry-wide supply chain challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our ability to receive and deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair our ability to meet customer demand for products, and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, and/or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution or fulfillment centers or those of our supply chain service providers; weather-related events; cybersecurity incidents or attacks; natural disasters; international trade disputes, trade policy changes or restrictions, or import- or export-related governmental sanctions or restrictions; customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; quotas, tariffs or other import-related taxes; strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shortages of supply chain labor, including truck drivers; shipping capacity constraints, including shortages of related equipment; raw material or other shortages; third-party contract disputes or inability to maintain favorable contract terms; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; increased costs or unavailability of fuel; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; acts of terrorism; public health issues, including pandemics or quarantines (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others; civil unrest; or other factors beyond our control. In recent years, ports in the U.S. and elsewhere have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters. Disruptions to our supply chain due to any of the factors listed above could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. \n\nIf our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, job applicant, business partner, and Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions. \n\nOur business, like that of most retailers, involves the collection, processing, retention, management, transmission, and deletion of personal information (including identifiers, internet activity, preferences, and payment information) from our customers, associates, job applicants, and business partners, as well as confidential Company information. We also work with third-party service providers that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the handling of information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are vulnerable to continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and will continue to attempt to gain access, to these systems and data through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates or third-party service providers. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain exploitable vulnerabilities, bugs, or defects in design, maintenance or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. We have experienced and continue to face the ongoing risk of exploitation of our software providers and our software development and implementation process, including from coding and process vulnerabilities and the installation of so-called back doors that provide unauthorized access to systems and data. The increased use of a remote workforce has also expanded the possible attack surface areas. In addition, the risk of cyber-attacks has increased in connection with Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting geopolitical conflict. In light of this and other geopolitical events, nation-state actors or their supporters may launch retaliatory cyber-attacks, and may attempt to cause supply chain and other third-party service provider disruptions, or take other geopolitically-motivated retaliatory actions that may disrupt our \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 15 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nbusiness operations, result in data compromise, or both. Nation-state actors have in the past carried out, and may in the future carry out, cyber-attacks to achieve their aims and goals, which may include espionage , monetary gain, disruption, and destruction. To achieve their objectives, nation-state actors and other cyber criminals have used and may continue to use numerous attack vectors and methods, including use of stolen passwords, social engineering, phishing, smishing, vishing, identity spoofing, ransomware or other disruptive and destructive malware, supply chain compromises, and man-in-the-middle and denial of service attacks. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving, increasing in frequency and sophistication, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. \n\nTo protect against unauthorized access to or use of data, prevent data loss, preserve data integrity, and protect our own access to systems, we have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and procedures; third-party assessments and testing; and annual associate training and other specific training initiatives. However, the ever-evolving threats mean that we and our third-party service providers and business partners must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of companies we acquire. There is no guarantee that the measures we take will be adequate to safeguard against all threats, including vulnerabilities, data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. As we saw in connection with the data breach we experienced in 2014, any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, job applicant, business partner, or Company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of anomalous activity or compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, as occurred in the case of the data breach we experienced in 2014, we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the occurrence of a security incident. \n\nIn addition, data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business. Our business depends on our customers&#8217;, associates&#8217;, job applicants&#8217; and business partners&#8217; willingness to entrust us with their personal information. Events that adversely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our customers, associates, job applicants, or business partners of our uses of their information or failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers&#8217;, associates&#8217;, job applicants&#8217; and business partners&#8217; personal information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction (including human error or malfeasance) or that of our service providers or other third parties, could adversely affect our brand and harm our reputation. Further, the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business. The implementation of these requirements has also become more complex. Maintaining our compliance with evolving requirements, including state privacy laws, requires significant effort and cost, requires changes to our business practices, and may limit our ability to collect and use certain data to support the customer experience. In addition, failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits or reputational damage. Additionally, our cyber insurance coverage may not be adequate for liabilities or costs actually incurred, and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage of a future claim. \n\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business. \n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards, cash, checks, PayPal, installment loan programs, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult, costly, or uncertain. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer, and the selling channels in which we operate, also subject us to potential fraud and theft by threat actors, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in our sales, payments and payment processing systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 16 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\ndue to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. \n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences, and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, climate change, natural disasters, as well as other catastrophic events, could impact our operations. \n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, fires, floods, droughts or water scarcity, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others; civil unrest; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers&#8217; disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. These types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. They can also, temporarily or on a long-term basis, disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition, these events may affect our information systems and digital platforms, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders; to communicate with our stores, facilities, store support centers or senior management; or to access financial or banking systems. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with customer needs. \n\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could affect, for example, the availability and cost of or demand for certain consumer products, commodities, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure certain goods or services for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we consider optimal. \n\nAs a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability. \n\nIf we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. \n\nWe buy our products from suppliers located around the world, who in turn procure materials from across the globe. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by economic or political instability; civil unrest; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; acts of terrorism or violence; public health issues (including pandemics and related impacts); the financial instability of suppliers; suppliers&#8217; noncompliance with applicable laws; contract disputes or inability to maintain favorable contract terms; trade restrictions; tariffs; currency exchange rates; disruptions in our suppliers&#8217; logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems; inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; raw material or other shortages; and other factors beyond our or our suppliers&#8217; control. If we are unable to access products to meet our customers&#8217; demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner, our sales and gross margin results may be adversely impacted. \n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety and ensure compliance with responsible sourcing laws and standards could damage our reputation with customers, expose us to litigation or enforcement actions, and negatively impact our sales and results of operations. \n\nProduct and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our Company. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable product standards or our customers&#8217; expectations regarding safety or quality , we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 17 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nand reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including health-related concerns, could expose us to litigation or government enforcement actions, and could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. We may not be successful in obtaining adequate contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers and service providers, which may result in claims having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high-quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. In addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing, which is an increasing focus of government regulators as well. All of our suppliers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environmental laws and regulations, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. We have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure that the products and services we provide to our customers comply with our standards and applicable law. Actual, potential or perceived supplier non-compliance could, and in certain instances in the past has, exposed us to litigation or governmental enforcement actions or resulted in costly product recalls; inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; and/or other liabilities. \n\nOur proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations, and reputational risks. \n\nIn addition to other product-related risks discussed in this section, as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers&#8217; products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits, reputational damage or the loss of our general contractor licenses. \n\nWe act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through professional third-party licensed and insured installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of background checks, licensing, permitting, and handling of environmental risks, as well as quality of work performed by our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and manage customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. However, as we experienced in part with our recent EPA investigation and resulting consent decree in April 2021, if we fail to manage these processes effectively, collect the appropriate documentation, perform regular job site inspections, or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, or governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as claims for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nLEGAL, FINANCIAL, REGULATORY, GLOBAL AND OTHER EXTERNAL RISKS \n\nUncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political and social climate, public health issues, and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. \n\nOur financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political or social climate could adversely impact our customers&#8217; confidence or financial condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. Other factors beyond our control &#8211; including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft (including as a result of organized retail crime); interest rate fluctuations; inflation or deflation; fuel and other energy costs; raw material or other shortages; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 18 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nthe credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; changes in tax rates and policy; weather and natural disasters (including the potential impacts of climate change); acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health issues, including pandemics and related impacts; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; and civil unrest, could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. A number of merchandise categories have been impacted by higher inflation than that which we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, and the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. If inflation increases costs beyond our ability to control our related costs, we may not be able to adjust prices or use our portfolio strategy to sufficiently offset the effect without negatively impacting consumer demand or our gross margin. Further, our MRO customers, who have higher spend and longer-term relationships than a typical retail customer, primarily use trade credit to finance their purchases, and some of our Pros use trade credit in order to purchase our products. As a result, their ability to pay is highly dependent on the economic strength of the industry in their areas. If these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us, we may face greater default risk, which could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. \n\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies, and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations has become increasingly complex. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data privacy and cybersecurity; the sale, marketing, sourcing, and pricing of some of our products; transportation, logistics and interstate delivery operations, including Department of Transportation regulations on vehicles and drivers; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes, including changes to corporate tax rates; restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; competition and antitrust requirements; ESG programs, transparency and reporting; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our sales, operations or profitability. \n\nIf we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted. \n\nOur ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political, social and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; international trade disputes, trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; limitations on access to ports; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; compliance with forced labor laws; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. For example, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. As a portion of our retail products are sourced, directly or indirectly, outside of the U.S., major changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and profitability of retail product sales in our U.S. locations. Other countries may also change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations. In addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 19 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. \n\nPrices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, and periodic delays in delivery. For example, Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the related international responses have exacerbated inflationary pressures, including causing increases in commodity prices as well as fuel and other energy costs. Rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices, such as changes in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy, may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins. If product cost inflation increases beyond our ability to control our related costs, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. \n\nThe continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable, volatile, and uncertain, and could adversely affect our business operations, demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, our exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption, uncertainty, and volatility, all of which have impacted our business. While we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, there can be no assurance that these efforts will continue to be successful. While efforts to address the pandemic, including vaccinations, have fostered progress and many restrictions have relaxed, due to numerous uncertainties and factors beyond our control, we are unable to predict the ongoing impact that the pandemic and recovery efforts will have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. These factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; the ongoing impact of COVID-19, including whether there are further &#8220;waves&#8221; or other continued increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases in future periods in areas in which we or our suppliers operate, and the potential for longer-term impact as COVID-19 becomes endemic; \n\n&#8226; the rapidly changing and fluid circumstances caused by the pandemic and efforts to contain and recover from it and our ability to respond quickly enough or appropriately to those circumstances; \n\n&#8226; the duration and degree of governmental, business or other actions in response to the pandemic, including but not limited to quarantine or shut-down measures and other governmental orders, or the termination of those measures; fiscal policy changes; or additional measures that may yet be enacted; \n\n&#8226; the health of, and longer-term effect of the pandemic on, our associates and our ability to maintain staffing needs to effectively operate our business; \n\n&#8226; changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers, including labor shortages and increased employee turnover; \n\n&#8226; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, inflation and deflation, rising interest rates, and recessionary pressures, and their ongoing impact on consumer confidence, economic well-being, spending, and shopping behaviors; \n\n&#8226; impacts &#8211; financial, operational or otherwise &#8211; on our supply chain, including on manufacturers or suppliers of our products and logistics or transportation providers, and on our service providers, subcontractors, or other business partners; \n\n&#8226; the effects on our internal control environment and data security as a result of the remote and hybrid work environment; \n\n&#8226; the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers&#8217; compensation; \n\n&#8226; potential increases in insurance premiums, medical claims costs, and workers&#8217; compensation claims costs; and \n\n&#8226; the impact of litigation or claims from customers, associates, suppliers, regulators or other third parties relating to COVID-19 or our actions in response thereto. \n\nIn addition, as the pandemic subsides, customers have shifted more of their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas, compared to the historic levels of home improvement spending we saw during the heights of the pandemic, which may have an adverse impact on our sales. \n\nThe above factors and uncertainties, or others of which we are not currently aware, may result in adverse impacts to our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition to the factors above, the \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 20 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nCOVID-19 pandemic has increased a number of other risks to our business, including but not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in these Risk Factors: \n\nAssociate and Customer Safety-Related Risks . The health and safety of our associates and customers are of primary concern to our management team. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took several steps to support our associates, including expanding certain compensation and benefits to help alleviate some of the challenges our associates were facing as a result of COVID-19, and adopted a number of enhanced safety measures in our stores and other facilities. We have transitioned from these temporary pay and benefits programs, as well as many of the enhanced safety measures. However, due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and the consequences of our actions, we may see unexpected outcomes from rolling back safety measures as conditions evolve, particularly if there are further outbreaks. If we do not respond appropriately to any further COVID-19 outbreaks, if our customers or associates do not participate in safety measures, or if rolling back safety measures results in additional outbreaks, the well-being of our associates and customers could be at risk. Furthermore, any failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response, could cause reputational harm to our brand and/or subject us to claims and litigation from associates, customers, suppliers, regulators or other third parties. Additionally, we have faced, and may continue to face, periodic labor shortages at our stores due to COVID-19 and other illnesses like influenza that were less prevalent during the height of the pandemic, which can result in modifications to our operations and negatively impact our business, costs and results of operations. \n\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers&#8217; compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase our exposure to workers&#8217; compensation claims and increase our cost of insurance. \n\nSupply Chain-Related Risks . Circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic causing cost increases, labor shortages, capacity constraints, disruptions and delays. These issues, which may continue or expand depending on the progression of the pandemic, have placed strain on the domestic and international supply chain, which has affected and may continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition. Similarly, increased demand for online purchases of products impacted our fulfillment operations, as well as those of our third-party carriers, resulting in delays in delivering products to customers. The operation of our distribution and fulfillment centers is crucial to our business operations. We and our suppliers have experienced, and may continue to experience, labor shortages at some of our distribution and fulfillment centers, and any such labor shortages, whether temporary or sustained, may adversely impact the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers. Any of these circumstances could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. \n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and related recovery efforts continue to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy and/or to adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, they may also heighten other risks described in this section and other SEC filings, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand and reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, associate and customer privacy, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements. \n\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance. \n\nWe are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers&#8217; compensation, employee group medical, employment practices liability and wage and hour claims, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks above the self-insurance levels. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. The occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage, or disputes with insurers regarding coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. \n\nGAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters, business combinations, and litigation, are complex and involve many \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 21 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nsubjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their application or interpretation, or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments, could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process, internal controls, and other changes that could increase our operating costs. \n\nWe are involved from time to time in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs. \n\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts, fines, or results. Additionally, as we have seen in the past, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings, as well as compliance with any settlements or consent decrees that result from those proceedings, can involve significant expense, divert management&#8217;s attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the Company. \n\n"

Net earnings were $17.1 billion, or $16.69 per diluted share. During fiscal 2022, we opened two new stores in the U.S. and four new stores in Mexico, and we lost one store in the U.S. due to a fire, resulting in a total store count of 2,322 at January 29, 2023. At the end of fiscal 2022, a total of 315 of our stores, or 13.6% of our total store count, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $627.17 in fiscal 2022. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.2 times at the end of fiscal 2022, compared to 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2022 resulting from strategic investments to promote higher in-stock levels and pull forward merchandise in response to ongoing global supply chain disruption, as well as continued investment in our new supply chain facilities and carryover of some spring seasonal inventory. \n\nWe generated $14.6 billion of cash flow from operations and issued $6.9 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, during fiscal 2022. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $7.8 billion for dividends and $6.7 billion for share repurchases. In addition, we repaid $2.5 billion of long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net short-term debt and funded $3.1 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2022. In February 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $2.09 per share. \n\nOur ROIC was 44.6% for fiscal 2022 and 44.7% for fiscal 2021. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure). \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 26 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following table presents the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 dollars in millions $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Net sales $ 157,403 $ 151,157 $ 132,110 Gross profit 52,778 33.5 % 50,832 33.6 % 44,853 34.0 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 26,284 16.7 25,406 16.8 24,447 18.5 Depreciation and amortization 2,455 1.6 2,386 1.6 2,128 1.6 Total operating expenses 28,739 18.3 27,792 18.4 26,575 20.1 Operating income 24,039 15.3 23,040 15.2 18,278 13.8 Interest and other (income) expense: Interest income and other, net (55) &#8212; (44) &#8212; (47) &#8212; Interest expense 1,617 1.0 1,347 0.9 1,347 1.0 Interest and other, net 1,562 1.0 1,303 0.9 1,300 1.0 Earnings before provision for income taxes \n\n22,477 14.3 21,737 14.4 16,978 12.9 Provision for income taxes 5,372 3.4 5,304 3.5 4,112 3.1 Net earnings $ 17,105 10.9 % $ 16,433 10.9 % $ 12,866 9.7 % ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\nNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. \n\n##TABLE_START % Change Selected financial and sales data: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Comparable sales (% change) 3.1 % 11.4 % 19.7 % N/A N/A \n\nComparable customer transactions (% change) (1) \n\n(5.4) % (0.1) % 8.6 % N/A N/A \n\nComparable average ticket (% change) (1) \n\n8.8 % 11.7 % 10.5 % N/A N/A \n\nCustomer transactions (in millions) (1) \n\n1,666.4 1,759.7 1,756.3 (5.3) % 0.2 % \n\nAverage ticket (1) (2) \n\n$90.36 $83.04 $74.32 8.8 % 11.7 % \n\nSales per retail square foot (1) (3) \n\n$627.17 $604.74 $543.74 3.7 % 11.2 % Diluted earnings per share $16.69 $15.53 $11.94 7.5 % 30.1 % ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n(1) Does not include results for HD Supply, including the legacy Interline Brands business, which was integrated into HD Supply during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. \n\n(2) Average ticket represents the average price paid per transaction and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company, as it represents a primary driver in measuring sales performance. \n\n(3) Sales per retail square foot represents sales divided by retail store square footage. Sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square footage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company&#8217;s retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square footage for these retail operations. \n\nFISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021 \n\nSales \n\nWe assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales. \n\nNet Sales. Net sales for fiscal 2022 increased $6.2 billion, or 4.1%, to $157.4 billion . The increase in net s ales for fiscal 2022 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a decrease in comparable customer transactions. A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by $339 million in fiscal 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 27 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nOnline sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 14.2% of net sales and grew by 7.4% during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in online sales in fiscal 2022 was a result of customers continuing to leverage our digital platforms and reflects our ongoing investments to enhance these platforms and related fulfillment capabilities, which support our interconnected retail strategy. \n\nComparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52 nd week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nTotal comparab le sales increased 3.1% in fiscal 2022, reflecting an 8.8% increase in com parable average ticket, partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in comparable average ticket was primarily driven by inflation, as well as demand for new and innovative products. The decrease in comparable customer transactions reflects the impact of macroeconomic factors during fiscal 2022, including indications of price sensitivity to the broader inflationary environment and a gradual shift in consumer spending from goods back to services, resulting in transactions trending towards fiscal 2019, pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. \n\nFor fiscal 2022, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales, led by Building Materials, P lumbing, Millwork, Paint, Hardware, and Kitchen and Bath, which posted comparable sales above the Company average. Our Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden, Appliances, and Flooring departments posted negative comparable sales. \n\nGross Profit \n\nGross profit increased $1.9 billion, or 3.8%, to $52.8 billion in fiscal 2022. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.5% in fiscal 2022 compared to 33.6% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by higher product and transportation costs, pressure from shrink during the second half of the year, and investments in our supply chain network, offset by the benefit from higher retail prices, along with favorable product mix. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOur operating expenses are composed of SG&#38;A and depreciation and amortization. \n\nSelling, General &#38; Administrative. SG&#38;A increased $878 million, or 3.5%, to $26.3 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, SG&#38;A was 16.7% in fiscal 2022 compared to 16.8% in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by wage investments for hourly associates and increased operational costs, including planned investmen ts designed to drive efficiencies in our stores . \n\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortiz ation increased $69 million, or 2.9%, to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.6% in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 , reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment, offset by increased depreciation expense from strategic investments in the business. \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\nInterest and other, net increased $259 million, or 19.9%, to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, interest and other, net, was 1.0% in fiscal 2022 compared to 0.9% in fiscal 2021 , primarily reflecting higher interest expense due to higher debt balances and increased variable rate interest on floating rate debt resulting from interest rate swaps, partially offset by leverage from a positive comparable sales environment. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur combined effective income tax rate was 23.9% in fiscal 2022 compared to 24.4% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2022 was driven by certain discrete tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 28 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share \n\nDiluted earnings per share were $16.69 in fiscal 2022 compared to $15.53 in fiscal 2021. The increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher net earnings during fiscal 2022, as well as lower diluted shares due to share repurchases. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \n\nTo provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies. \n\nReturn on Invested Capital \n\nWe believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. \n\nThe following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure): \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal dollars in millions 2022 2021 2020 Net earnings $ 17,105 $ 16,433 $ 12,866 Interest and other, net 1,562 1,303 1,300 Provision for income taxes 5,372 5,304 4,112 Operating income 24,039 23,040 18,278 \n\nIncome tax adjustment (1) \n\n(5,745) (5,622) (4,423) NOPAT $ 18,294 $ 17,418 $ 13,855 Average debt and equity $ 41,055 $ 38,946 $ 33,964 ROIC 44.6 % 44.7 % 40.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n(1) Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nAt January 29, 2023, we had $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $825 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. \n\nOur material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. For fiscal 2023, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in fiscal 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 29 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we paid cash dividends of $7.8 billion to shareholders. In February 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.90 to $2.09 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. \n\nIn August 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $20.0 billion, which was approved in May 2021. This new authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of January 29, 2023, approximately $12.5 billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available. During fiscal 2022, we had cash payments of $6.7 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases. \n\nDEBT \n\nIn July 2022, we expanded our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion to further enhance our financial flexibility. All of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2022 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $2.7 billion. In connection with our program, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks. In July 2022, we also expanded the borrowing capacity under these back-up facilities from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion by entering into a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2023. These facilities replaced our previously existing five-year $2.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2023, and our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2022. At January 29, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. \n\nWe also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. In March 2022, we issued $4.0 billion of senior notes. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of shares of our common stock. In September 2022, we issued an additional $3.0 billion of senior notes. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2022, we repaid $2.25 billion of senior notes. At January 29, 2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of $41.2 billion, with $1.0 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these senior notes total $24.9 billion, with $1.7 billion payable within 12 months, based on current interest rates, which include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements. \n\nThe indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements. \n\nLEASES \n\nWe use operating and finance leases largely to fund a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. At January 29, 2023, we had aggregate lease obligations of $14.7 billion, with $1.5 billion payable within 12 months. Aggregate lease obligations include $2.1 billion of obligations related to leases not yet commenced. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating and finance leases. \n\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER \n\nPurchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, media and sponsorship spend, software and license commitments, and legally binding service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which are typically cancellable by their terms, therefore we do not consider purchase orders that are cancellable to be firm inventory commitments. At January 29, 2023, we had aggregate purchase obligations of $1.8 billion, with $947 million payable within 12 months. \n\nAt January 29, 2023, we had aggregate liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaling $643 million, none of which are expected to be paid in the next 12 months. The timing of payment, if any, associated with our long-term unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is unknown. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 30 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nCASH FLOWS SUMMARY \n\nOperating Activities \n\nCash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by changes in working capital, slightly offset by an increase in net earnings. Changes in working capital were driven by inventory management actions and the related timing of vendor payments. These inventory management actions, which began in fiscal 2021 and moderated during the second half of fiscal 2022, reflect strategic investments in inventory to support the demand environment, promote higher in-stock levels, and pull forward merchandise for seasonal events in response to global supply chain disruption, as well as investments in our new supply chain facilities. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nCash used in investing activities increased by $171 million in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily resulting from increased capital expenditures, partially offset by cash paid for an acquired business during fiscal 2021. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 primarily reflected $7.8 billion of cash dividends paid, $6.7 billion of share repurchases, $2.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and $1.0 billion of net repayments of short-term debt, partially offset by $6.9 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt. \n\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8 billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt. Fiscal 2021 reflected elevated share repurchase activity following the temporary suspension of repurchases during fiscal 2020 in order to enhance our liquidity position at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 31 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. \n\nMERCHANDISE INVENTORIES \n\nWe value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. \n\nThe retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions, the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market. The valuation under the retail inventory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a variety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions. \n\nWe calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inventory shrink reserve would have increased cost of sales by approximately $113 million for fiscal 2022. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results. \n\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method. We believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market. \n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \n\nFor information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n\nINTEREST RATE RISK \n\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, none of which are for trading or speculative purposes. At January 29, 2023, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating-rate debt principal was $5.4 billion, or approximately 13% of our senior notes portfolio. Our interest rate swap agreements were in an aggregate liability position of $778 million at January 29, 2023. The changes in the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt. Based on our January 29, 2023 floating-rate debt principal, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of floating-rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $54 million. \n\nThe United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority announced the phased cessation of publication of LIBOR beginning after 2021 and continuing through 2023. While the discontinuance of LIBOR tenors that are scheduled to occur in 2023 will impact our interest rate swaps, we do not anticipate the transition to a new reference rate will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 32 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK \n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. We use derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk, none of which are for trading or speculative purposes. Our foreign currency related hedging arrangements outstanding at the end of fiscal 2022 were not material. \n\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK \n\nWe experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. This price volatility could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition and/or our results of operations. In order to mitigate price volatility, we monitor commodity price fluctuations and may adjust our selling prices accordingly; however, our ability to recover higher costs through increased pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We currently do not use derivative instruments to manage these risks. \n\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nEstimation of store shrink \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the Company&#8217;s U.S. merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first out) or market as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. The Company calculates shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring in the period between physical inventory counts and fiscal year-end as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company&#8217;s estimation of shrink at the end of the fiscal year using interim inventory loss experience in U.S. retail stores involved auditor judgment. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 34 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the process of developing the estimate of store shrink. We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company using interim physical inventory counts to estimate inventory losses in U.S. retail stores at the end of the fiscal year by: \n\n&#8226; Evaluating the method and certain assumptions used; \n\n&#8226; Testing the application of the method and certain assumptions used; \n\n&#8226; Performing a current year trend analysis; and \n\n&#8226; Performing a sensitivity analysis over the shrink reserve estimate. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1979. \n\nAtlanta, Georgia \n\nMarch 15, 2023 \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 35 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nTHE HOME DEPOT, INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n##TABLE_START in millions, except per share data January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,757 &#160;

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nBusiness \n\nThe Home Depot, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Home Depot,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;), is a home improvement retailer that sells a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, d&#233;cor items, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products, in stores and online. We also provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. We operate in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. \n\nConsolidation and Presentation \n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31 st . All periods presented include 52 weeks. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nWe have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. While we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. \n\nReceivables, net \n\nThe following table presents components of receivables, net: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Card receivables $ 1,003 &#160; $ 1,028 &#160; Rebate receivables 948 &#160; 1,170 &#160; Customer receivables 871 &#160; 703 &#160; Other receivables 495 &#160; 525 &#160; Receivables, net $ 3,317 &#160; $ 3,426 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCard receivables consist of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions. Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business. The valuation allowance related to these receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. \n\nMerchandise Inventories \n\nInventory cost includes the amount we pay to acquire inventory, including freight and import costs, as well as operating costs and depreciation associated with our sourcing and distribution network, and is net of certain vendor allowances. The majority of our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, as determined by a cost method. These merchandise inventories represent approximately 42 % of the total merchandise inventories balance. We evaluate the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the adjustments recorded to merchandise inventories valued under a cost method were not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 41 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nPhysical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise inventories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results. \n\nProperty and Equipment \n\nBuildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. \n\nThe following table presents the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Life Buildings and improvements 5 &#8211; 45 years \n\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 2 &#8211; 20 years \n\nLeasehold improvements 5 &#8211; 45 years \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe capitalize certain costs, including interest, related to construction in progress and the acquisition and development of software. Costs associated with the acquisition and development of software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which ranges from three to seven years . Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. \n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset group&#8217;s fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SG&#38;A. Impairment charges for long-lived assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020. \n\nLeases \n\nWe enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement, and are accounted for accordingly. Specifically, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. \n\nOur leases include certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space, office space, equipment, and vehicles. A substantial majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of one to 20 years. Our real estate leases typically provide the option to extend the lease for five-year terms, and some of our leases may include the option to terminate in less than five years . The lease term used to calculate the right-of-use asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement, we consider various existing economic factors, including market conditions, real estate strategies, the nature, length, and terms of the agreement, as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Based on these determinations, we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 42 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use a secured incremental borrowing rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis, as the discount rate for the present value of lease payments. \n\nReal estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and operating expenses applicable to the leased asset are generally our obligations under our lease agreements. In instances where these payments are fixed, they are included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, and when variable, are excluded and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Certain of our lease agreements also include rental payments based on an index or rate and others include rental payments based on a percentage of sales. For variable payments dependent upon an index or rate, we apply the active index or rate as of the lease commencement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of our lease liabilities as they cannot be reasonably estimated, and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. \n\nLeases that have a term of twelve months or less upon commencement are considered short-term in nature. Short-term leases are not included on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets including real estate and certain equipment. \n\nOur lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed as facts and circumstances warrant. We completed our last quantitative assessment in fiscal 2019 and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values, including goodwill. \n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our U.S., Canada, and Mexico reporting units based on qualitative factors. We performed a qualitative assessment to determine if there were any indicators of impairment and concluded that while there have been events and circumstances in the macro-environment that have impacted us, we have not experienced any entity-specific indicators that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. There were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020. \n\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of our goodwill: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 Goodwill, balance at beginning of year $ 7,449 &#160; $ 7,126 &#160; \n\nAcquisitions (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 323 &#160; \n\nOther (2) \n\n( 5 ) &#8212; &#160; Goodwill, balance at end of year $ 7,444 &#160; $ 7,449 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n(1) Represents goodwill from a small acquisition completed during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021. \n\n(2) Reflects the net impact of foreign currency translation. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 43 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nOther Intangible Assets \n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. We amortize the cost of definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years, as this approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets based on quantitative factors and concluded no impairment losses should be recognized. There were no impairment losses related to intangible assets for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. \n\nThe following table presents information regarding our intangible assets: \n\n##TABLE_START January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 in millions Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Definite-Lived Intangible Assets: Customer relationships $ 3,034 &#160; $ ( 495 ) $ 2,539 &#160; $ 3,034 &#160; $ ( 326 ) $ 2,708 &#160; Trade names 151 &#160; ( 16 ) 135 &#160; 151 &#160; ( 8 ) 143 &#160; Other 12 &#160; ( 12 ) &#8212; &#160; 12 &#160; ( 9 ) 3 &#160; Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: Trade names 649 &#160; 649 &#160; 649 &#160; 649 &#160; Total Intangible Assets $ 3,846 &#160; $ ( 523 ) $ 3,323 &#160; $ 3,846 &#160; $ ( 343 ) $ 3,503 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOur intangible asset amortization expense was immaterial for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. \n\nThe following table presents the estimated future amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets as of January 29, 2023: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Amortization Expense \n\nFiscal 2023 $ 178 &#160; Fiscal 2024 178 &#160; Fiscal 2025 178 &#160; Fiscal 2026 178 &#160; Fiscal 2027 167 &#160; Thereafter 1,795 &#160; Total $ 2,674 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDebt \n\nWe record any premiums or discounts associated with an issuance of long-term debt as a direct addition or deduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes. We also record debt issuance costs associated with an issuance of long-term debt as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes. Premium, discount, and debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest rate method. \n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities \n\nWe use derivative instruments in the management of our interest rate exposure on long-term debt and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only; we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recognized at their fair values in either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and are classified as either current or non-current based on each contract&#8217;s respective maturity. While we enter into master netting arrangements, our policy is to present the fair value of derivative instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nChanges in the fair values for derivative instruments designated as cash flow or net investment hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, which for net investment hedges is upon sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investment. Changes in fair value of outstanding fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged item are \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 44 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nrecognized in earnings. We record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item. \n\nDerivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, if any, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings each period in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item. Cash flows from the settlement of derivative instruments appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged item. \n\nSelf-Insurance Reserves \n\nWe are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers&#8217; compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims. We recognize the expected ultimate cost for claims incurred (undiscounted) at the balance sheet date as a liability. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. Our self-insurance liabilities, which are included in accrued salaries and related expenses, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, were $ 1.3 billion at both January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. \n\nWe also maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security. \n\nTreasury Stock \n\nTreasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders&#8217; equity at cost. We use the weighted average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued, if any. \n\nNet Sales \n\nWe recognize revenue, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. Our liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels and our expectation of future returns. We also recognize a return asset, and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales, for our right to recover the goods returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods, less any expected recovery cost. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities, and return assets. Adjustments related to changes in return estimates were immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. \n\nServices revenue is generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance, and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we provide or arrange for professional installation. These programs are offered through our stores, online, and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we provide or arrange for the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. We recognize services revenue when the service for the customer is complete, which is not materially different from recognizing the revenue over the service period as the substantial majority of our services are completed within one week. \n\nFor products and services sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, deferred revenue for products and services was $ 2.0 billion and $ 2.6 billion, respectively. \n\nWe further record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards, which generally occurs within six months of gift card issuance. As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, is recognized in net sales and was immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. \n\nWe also have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables. We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028, with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the existing receivables at the end of the agreement. Deferred interest charges incurred for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in net sales. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 45 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nCost of Sales \n\nCost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network. Vendor allowances that are not reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are also included within cost of sales. \n\nVendor Allowances \n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors&#8217; products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses, advertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other administrative costs. \n\nAdvertising Expense \n\nAdvertising costs, including digital, television, radio and print, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors&#8217; products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. \n\nThe following table presents net advertising expense included in SG&#38;A: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 Net advertising expense $ 1,085 &#160; $ 1,044 &#160; $ 909 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nWe are currently authorized to issue incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and deferred shares to certain of our associates and non-employee directors under certain stock incentive plans. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to associates and non-employee directors based on estimated fair values. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense, on a straight-line basis, over the requisite service period or as restrictions lapse. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating stock-based compensation expense. Additional information on our stock-based payment awards is included in Note 8 . \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. \n\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 46 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return which includes certain eligible subsidiaries. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. For unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an assertion regarding reinvestment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any earnings that we do not make a permanent reinvestment assertion, we recognize a provision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we have made a permanent reinvestment assertion, no provision is recognized. See Note 5 for further discussion. \n\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and SG&#38;A, respectively, on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nWe are subject to global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) tax, an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made an accounting election to record this tax in the period the tax arises. \n\nComprehensive Income \n\nComprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings and recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of equity, which consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive loss also includes net losses on cash flow hedges that were immaterial as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings were immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. \n\nForeign Currency Translation \n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022 were losses of $ 597 million and $ 575 million, respectively. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \n\nASU No. 2021-10. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, &#8220;Government Assistance (Topic 832),&#8221; to improve the transparency of government assistance received by business entities that are accounted for by applying either the International Accounting Standards 20 grant model or Accounting Standards Codification 958-605 contribution model by analogy. Topic 832 requires disclosure of the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item, and significant terms of the transactions. On January 31, 2022, we adopted ASU No. 2021-10 with no impact to our financial statements or related disclosures as the transactions in scope of this guidance were immaterial. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \n\nASU No. 2022-04. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, &#8220;Liabilities&#8212;Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,&#8221; to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs used by an entity in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The standard requires entities that use supplier finance programs to disclose the key terms, including a description of payment terms, the confirmed amount outstanding under the program at the end of each reporting period, a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and an annual rollforward, including the amount of obligations confirmed and the amount paid during the period. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. ASU No. 2022-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the requirement on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures. \n\nASU No. 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, &#8220;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,&#8221; which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform.

SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES \n\nWe currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to analyze performance, make decisions and allocate resources. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three operating segments into one reportable segment due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics. \n\nThe following table presents net property and equipment, classified by geography: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 Net property and equipment &#8211; in the U.S. $ 23,057 &#160; $ 22,696 &#160; $ 22,205 &#160; Net property and equipment &#8211; outside the U.S. 2,574 &#160; 2,503 &#160; 2,500 &#160; Net property and equipment $ 25,631 &#160; $ 25,199 &#160; $ 24,705 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNo sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue during any of the last three fiscal years. \n\nThe following table presents net sales, classified by geography: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal in millions 2022 2021 2020 Net sales &#8211; in the U.S. $ 144,840 &#160; $ 138,920 &#160; $ 122,158 &#160; Net sales &#8211; outside the U.S. 12,563 &#160; 12,237 &#160; 9,952 &#160; Net sales $ 157,403 &#160; $ 151,157 &#160; $ 132,110 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents net sales by products and services: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal in millions 2022 2021 2020 Net sales &#8211; products $ 151,804 &#160; $ 145,745 &#160; $ 127,671 &#160; Net sales &#8211; services 5,599 &#160; 5,412 &#160; 4,439 &#160; Net sales $ 157,403 &#160; $ 151,157 &#160; $ 132,110 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents major product lines and the related merchandising departments (and related services): \n\n##TABLE_START Major Product Line Merchandising Departments Building Materials \n\nBuilding Materials, Electrical/Lighting, Lumber, Millwork, and Plumbing \n\nD&#233;cor \n\nAppliances, D&#233;cor/Storage, Flooring, Kitchen and Bath, and Paint \n\nHardlines \n\nHardware, Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden, and Tools \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 48 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table presents net sales by major product line (and related services): \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal in millions 2022 2021 2020 Building Materials $ 59,533 &#160; $ 54,990 &#160; $ 46,521 &#160; D&#233;cor 52,322 &#160; 50,437 &#160; 43,415 &#160; Hardlines 45,548 &#160; 45,730 &#160; 42,174 &#160; Net sales $ 157,403 &#160; $ 151,157 &#160; $ 132,110 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents net sales by merchandising department (and related services): \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 dollars in millions Net Sales % of Net Sales Net Sales % of Net Sales Net Sales % of Net Sales Appliances $ 14,461 &#160; 9.2 &#160; % $ 14,232 &#160; 9.4 &#160; % $ 11,865 &#160; 9.0 &#160; % Building Materials 11,298 &#160; 7.2 &#160; 9,823 &#160; 6.5 &#160; 8,656 &#160; 6.6 &#160; D&#233;cor/Storage 6,357 &#160; 4.0 &#160; 6,095 &#160; 4.0 &#160; 4,959 &#160; 3.8 &#160; Electrical/Lighting 13,746 &#160; 8.7 &#160; 13,473 &#160; 8.9 &#160; 11,178 &#160; 8.5 &#160; Flooring 9,222 &#160; 5.9 &#160; 9,225 &#160; 6.1 &#160; 8,156 &#160; 6.2 &#160; Hardware 8,104 &#160; 5.1 &#160; 7,873 &#160; 5.2 &#160; 7,312 &#160; 5.5 &#160; Indoor Garden 14,990 &#160; 9.5 &#160; 15,546 &#160; 10.3 &#160; 14,649 &#160; 11.1 &#160; Kitchen and Bath 11,102 &#160; 7.1 &#160; 10,432 &#160; 6.9 &#160; 8,383 &#160; 6.3 &#160; Lumber 13,460 &#160; 8.6 &#160; 13,344 &#160; 8.8 &#160; 11,309 &#160; 8.6 &#160; Millwork 8,423 &#160; 5.4 &#160; 7,412 &#160; 4.9 &#160; 6,460 &#160; 4.9 &#160; Outdoor Garden 10,078 &#160; 6.4 &#160; 10,317 &#160; 6.8 &#160; 9,602 &#160; 7.3 &#160; Paint 11,180 &#160; 7.1 &#160; 10,453 &#160; 6.9 &#160; 10,052 &#160; 7.6 &#160; Plumbing 12,606 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 10,938 &#160; 7.2 &#160; 8,918 &#160; 6.8 &#160; Tools 12,376 &#160; 7.9 &#160; 11,994 &#160; 7.9 &#160; 10,611 &#160; 8.0 &#160; Total $ 157,403 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % $ 151,157 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % $ 132,110 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\nNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. \n\n3.

Interest on these notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2022. \n\n&#8226; The fourth tranche consisted of $ 1.5 billion of 3.625 % senior notes due April 15, 2052 at a discount of $ 32 million. Interest on these notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2022. \n\n&#8226; Issuance costs totaled $ 22 million. \n\nRepayments . In March 2022, we repaid our $ 700 million 3.25 % senior notes and $ 300 million floating rate senior notes at maturity. In May 2022, we repaid our $ 1.25 billion 2.625 % senior notes, which had a maturity date of June 2022, at the Par Call Date for the notes. \n\nRedemption. All of our senior notes may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. With respect to the 5.875 % 2036 notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100 % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed that would be due after the related redemption date. With respect to all other notes, prior to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100 % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date. On or after the Par Call Date, the redemption price is equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in the notes, holders of all such notes have the right to require us to redeem those notes at 101 % of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. \n\nThe indentures governing the notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 53 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nMaturities of Long-Term Debt. The following table presents our long-term debt maturities, excluding finance leases, as of January 29, 2023: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Principal Fiscal 2023 $ 1,000 &#160; Fiscal 2024 1,100 &#160; Fiscal 2025 2,250 &#160; Fiscal 2026 2,300 &#160; Fiscal 2027 2,500 &#160; Thereafter 32,000 &#160; Total $ 41,150 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities \n\nWe use derivative instruments as part of our normal business operations in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on certain debt. Our objective in managing these exposures is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and minimize the risk of changes in the fair value of our senior notes. \n\nFair Value Hedges. We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $ 5.4 billion at January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. These agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. At January 29, 2023, the fair values of these agreements totaled $ 778 million, all of which is recognized in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At January 30, 2022, the fair values of these agreements totaled $ 191 million, with $ 58 million recognized in other assets and $ 249 million recognized in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt. \n\nCash Flow Hedges. At January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges, which hedge the variability of forecasted cash flows associated with certain payments made in our foreign operations. At January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the notional amounts and the fair values of these contracts were not material. Additionally, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments were not material during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. \n\nWe also settled forward-starting interest rate swap agreements in prior years, which were used to hedge the variability in future interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on forecasted debt issuances. Unamortized losses on these forward-starting swaps, which were designated as cash flow hedges, are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective notes. Unamortized losses recognized on these swaps remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss were immaterial as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, as were the losses recognized within interest expense for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. \n\nWe expect an immaterial amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of January 29, 2023 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. \n\nNet Investment Hedges. During fiscal 2022, we issued foreign currency forward contracts accounted for as net investment hedges, which hedged against foreign currency exposure on our net investment in certain subsidiaries. These foreign currency forward contracts were immaterial and were settled in fiscal 2022. The related foreign currency translation adjustment amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon settlement were also immaterial. There were no arrangements accounted for as net investment hedges outstanding as of January 29, 2023 or January 30, 2022. \n\nCollateral. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $ 634 million as of January 29, 2023, which was recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We did not hold any cash collateral as of January 29, 2023, and cash collateral both held and posted was immaterial as of January 30, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 54 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n5.

The key tax provisions include a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income. We do not expect any impact to the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate as a result of the new 15% minimum tax under the 2022 Tax Act. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 55 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nDeferred Taxes \n\nThe following table presents the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Assets: Deferred compensation $ 236 &#160; $ 471 &#160; Accrued self-insurance liabilities 276 &#160; 272 &#160; State income taxes 149 &#160; 138 &#160; Merchandise inventories 30 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Non-deductible reserves 318 &#160; 250 &#160; Net operating losses 115 &#160; 150 &#160; Lease liabilities 1,879 &#160; 1,528 &#160; Deferred revenue 148 &#160; 121 &#160; Other 56 &#160; 67 &#160; Total deferred tax assets 3,207 &#160; 2,997 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 5 ) ( 10 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 3,202 &#160; 2,987 &#160; Liabilities: Merchandise inventories &#8212; &#160; ( 14 ) Property and equipment ( 992 ) ( 902 ) Goodwill and other intangibles ( 953 ) ( 985 ) Lease right-of-use assets ( 1,799 ) ( 1,473 ) Tax on unremitted earnings ( 63 ) ( 74 ) Other ( 95 ) ( 104 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 3,902 ) ( 3,552 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 700 ) $ ( 565 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents our noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, netted by tax jurisdiction, as presented on the consolidated balance sheets: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Consolidated Balance Sheet Classification January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Deferred tax assets Other assets $ 319 &#160; $ 344 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities Deferred income taxes ( 1,019 ) ( 909 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 700 ) $ ( 565 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of January 29, 2023, we recorded deferred tax assets of $ 115 million for net operating losses, primarily related to state jurisdictions. These losses expire at various dates beginning in 2023. We have concluded that it is more likely than not that tax benefits related to substantially all net operating losses will be realized based upon the expectation that we will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods. \n\nReinvestment of Unremitted Earnings \n\nSubstantially all of our current year foreign cash earnings in excess of working capital and cash needed for strategic investments are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Therefore, the tax effects of repatriation for applicable state taxes and foreign withholding taxes of such cash earnings have been provided for in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. We have the intent and ability to reinvest substantially all of the $ 4.1 billion of non -cash unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for state taxes or foreign withholding taxes was recorded on these unremitted earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. It is impracticable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 56 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nTax Return Examination Status \n\nOur income tax returns are routinely examined by U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign tax authorities. As of January 29, 2023, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2010. Our U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2021, with the exception of 2015, are currently under examination by the IRS. With respect to the fiscal years 2010 to 2014, the IRS has issued a proposed adjustment relating to transfer pricing between our entities in the U.S. and China. We are defending our position using all available remedies. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local audits and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2013 through 2020. We do not expect the results from any ongoing income tax audit to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nOver the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations, could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount. We do not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. \n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits \n\nThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of fiscal year $ 570 &#160; $ 540 &#160; $ 473 &#160; Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 75 &#160; 80 &#160; 75 &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years 22 &#160; 24 &#160; 72 &#160; Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 7 ) ( 40 ) ( 53 ) Reductions due to settlements ( 1 ) ( 29 ) ( 22 ) Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations ( 16 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of fiscal year $ 643 &#160; $ 570 &#160; $ 540 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect our annual effective income tax rate on net earnings were $ 537 million, $ 479 million, and $ 458 million at January 29, 2023, January 30, 2022, and January 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nInterest and Penalties \n\nNet adjustments to accruals for interest and penalties a ssociated with uncertain tax positions were immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. Our total accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions were immaterial as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. \n\n6.

This new authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of January 29, 2023, approximately $ 12.5 billion of the $ 15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available. \n\nIn March 2020, we suspended our share repurchases to enhance our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We resumed share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. \n\nThe following table presents information about our repurchases of common stock, all of which were completed through open market purchases: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal \n\nin millions \n\n2022 2021 2020 Total number of shares repurchased 21 &#160; 45 &#160; 3 &#160; \n\nTotal cost of shares repurchased \n\n$ 6,504 &#160; $ 15,001 &#160; $ 597 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThese amounts may differ from the repurchases of common stock amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to unsettled share repurchases at the end of a period. \n\n7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nThe fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liability&#8217;s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: \n\n&#8226; Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \n\n&#8226; Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and \n\n&#8226; Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring management judgment to develop the Company&#8217;s own models with estimates and assumptions. \n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \n\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: \n\n##TABLE_START January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 in millions Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Derivative agreements &#8211; assets \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 58 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative agreements &#8211; liabilities \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 778 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 249 ) &#8212; &#160; Total \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 778 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 191 ) $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments are determined using an income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the respective interest rate or foreign currency forward curves and discount rates. Our derivative instruments are discussed further in Note 4 . \n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \n\nLong-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement for the assessment of impairment. We did not have any material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020. \n\nOther Fair Value Disclosures \n\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, short-term debt, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 58 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table presents the aggregate fair values and carrying values of our senior notes: \n\n##TABLE_START January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 in millions Fair Value (Level 1) Carrying Value Fair Value (Level 1) Carrying Value Senior notes $ 38,537 &#160; $ 39,908 &#160; $ 39,397 &#160; $ 35,815 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n8. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nOmnibus Stock Incentive Plans \n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated May 19, 2022 (the &#8220;Omnibus Plan&#8221;) and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the &#8220;1997 Plan&#8221; and collectively with the Omnibus Plan, the &#8220;Plans&#8221;) provide that incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, deferred shares, and other stock-based awards may be issued to certain of our associates and non-employee directors. Under th e Omnibus Plan, the maximum number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance is 80 million shares plus a number of shares (not to exceed 10 million) related to underlying awards outstanding as of May 19, 2022, which can be returned to the share pool if those awards are subsequently terminated or expire unexercised, or are cancelled, forfeited or lapse for any reason, with any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. At January 29, 2023, there were approximately 80 million shares available for future grants under the Omnibus Plan. No additional equity awards could be issued from the 1997 Plan after May 26, 2005. \n\nThe following table presents total stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, including expense related to our ESPPs, and related income tax benefit: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 Pre-tax stock-based compensation expense $ 367 &#160; $ 403 &#160; $ 310 &#160; Income tax benefit ( 73 ) ( 86 ) ( 58 ) After-tax stock-based compensation expense $ 294 &#160; $ 317 &#160; $ 252 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt January 29, 2023, there was $ 424 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years . \n\nThe award types issued under the Plans are as follows: \n\nStock Options. Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant. Typically, nonqualified stock options vest at the rate of 25 % per year commencing on the second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, a majority of our stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60 , provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. No incentive stock options have been issued under the Omnibus Plan. \n\nWe estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. \n\nThe following table presents the per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted and the assumptions used in determining fair value at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Per share weighted average fair value $ 70.21 &#160; $ 57.71 &#160; $ 36.77 &#160; Risk-free interest rate 2.5 &#160; % 1.0 &#160; % 0.6 &#160; % Assumed volatility 27.0 &#160; % 26.5 &#160; % 29.9 &#160; % Assumed dividend yield 2.4 &#160; % 2.2 &#160; % 3.1 &#160; % Assumed lives of options 6 years 6 years 6 years ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 59 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table presents a summary of stock option activity by number of shares and weighted average exercise price during fiscal 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START shares in thousands Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at beginning of year 3,641 &#160; $ 150.30 &#160; Granted 302 &#160; 316.09 &#160; Exercised ( 292 ) 98.66 &#160; Forfeited ( 25 ) 238.56 &#160; Outstanding at end of year 3,626 &#160; 167.66 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 61 &#160; $ 237 &#160; $ 217 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents details regarding outstanding and exercisable stock options at January 29, 2023: \n\n##TABLE_START shares in thousands, dollars in millions, except for per share amounts Number of Shares Intrinsic Value Weighted Average Remaining Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding 3,626 &#160; $ 541 &#160; 4.6 years $ 167.66 &#160; Exercisable 2,448 &#160; 457 &#160; 3.2 years 130.00 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nShares of common stock issued from stock option exercises may be issued from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury stock. \n\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards. Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse over various periods up to five years . At the grant date of the award, recipients of restricted stock are granted voting rights and generally receive dividends on unvested shares, paid in the form of cash on each dividend payment date. Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020. Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate&#8217;s attainment of age 60 , provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. \n\nWe have also granted performance share awards under the Plans. These awards provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock at the end of the three-year performance cycle based upon our performance against target average ROIC and operating profit over that performance cycle. Additionally, the awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate&#8217;s attainment of age 60 , provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance share awards have no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. \n\nRestricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after the grant date. Additionally, the majority of these awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60 , provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights until the vesting of the award. Recipients receive dividend equivalents that accrue on unvested units and are paid out in the form of additional shares of stock on the vesting date. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the units vest. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 60 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table presents a summary of restricted stock, performance shares, and restricted stock unit activity during fiscal 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START shares in thousands Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested at beginning of year 3,709 &#160; $ 218.60 &#160; Granted 1,441 &#160; 304.57 &#160; Vested ( 1,516 ) 191.82 &#160; Forfeited ( 275 ) 260.13 &#160; Nonvested at end of year 3,359 &#160; 261.66 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the total fair value of restricted stock, performance shares, and restricted stock units vested: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 Total fair value vested $ 479 &#160; $ 405 &#160; $ 271 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDeferred Shares. We grant awards of deferred shares to non-employee directors under the Plans. Each deferred share entitles the non-employee director to one share of common stock to be received following termination of Board service. Recipients of deferred shares have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents that accrue and are paid out in the form of additional shares of stock upon payout of the underlying shares following termination of service. The fair value of the deferred shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed immediately upon grant. \n\nThe following table presents deferred shares granted to non-employee directors: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 Deferred shares granted to non-employee directors 19,000 &#160; 15,000 &#160; 18,000 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans \n\nWe maintain two ESPPs: a U.S. and a non-U.S. plan. The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. At January 29, 2023, there were approximately 16 million shares available under the U.S. plan and approximately 18 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85 % of the stock&#8217;s fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2022, there were approximately 1 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $ 247.86 . Under the outstanding ESPPs at January 29, 2023, associates have contributed $ 22 million to purchase shares at 85 % of the stock&#8217;s fair market value on the last day of the current purchase period, June 30, 2023. \n\n9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \n\nWe maintain active defined contribution retirement plans for our associates (the &#8220;Benefit Plans&#8221;). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. We make cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates&#8217; contributions as approved by our Board of Directors. \n\nWe also maintain the Restoration Plans to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. We fund the Restoration Plans through contributions made to grantor trusts, which are then used to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market. \n\nThe following table presents our contributions to the Benefit Plans and the Restoration Plans: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2022 2021 2020 Contributions to the Benefit Plans and the Restoration Plans $ 280 &#160; $ 278 &#160; $ 267 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt January 29, 2023, the Benefit Plans and the Restoration Plans held a total of 5.3 million shares of our common stock in trusts for plan participants. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 61 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n10.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nAt January 29, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $ 486 million, primarily related to certain business transactions, including insurance programs, trade contracts, and construction contracts. \n\nWe are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business. In management&#8217;s opinion, any such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\n12. HD SUPPLY ACQUISITION \n\nOn November 16, 2020, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HD Supply, a leading national distributor of MRO products to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and government housing facilities, among others. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Home Depot made a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the common stock of HD Supply Holdings, Inc., the ultimate parent entity of HD Supply, for $ 56 per share, and the acquisition was completed on December 24, 2020. The acquisition was funded through cash on hand, a portion of which was replaced with the proceeds from our issuance of $ 3.0 billion of senior notes in January 2021. \n\nThe following table summarizes total purchase consideration: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions Total cash consideration for outstanding shares $ 8,637 &#160; \n\nValue of stock-based awards attributed to services already rendered (1) \n\n55 &#160; Total purchase consideration $ 8,692 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n(1) In connection with the completion of the acquisition, all HD Supply stock-based awards were cash settled for an aggregate value of $ 111 million. As the settlement of the awards was at the discretion of the Company, the portion of the fair value of the awards attributed to services previously provided of $ 55 million was included as part of purchase consideration, with the remaining $ 56 million recognized as post-combination expense within SG&#38;A in our consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 2020. \n\nThe total purchase consideration of $ 8.7 billion, less cash acquired of $ 912 million, resulted in a net cash outflow of $ 7.8 billion on the consolidated statement of cash flows in fiscal 2020. \n\nNet sales and net earnings for fiscal 2020 attributable to HD Supply after the completion of the acquisition were immaterial. Pro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition and therefore are not presented. \n\n"

Controls and Procedures. \n\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2023 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. \n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. \n\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nWe are in the process of an ongoing business transformation initiative, which includes upgrading and migrating certain accounting and finance systems. We plan to continue to migrate additional business processes over the course of the next few years and have modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes as the transformation continues. \n\nExcept as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 63 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors \n\nThe Home Depot, Inc.: \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nAtlanta, Georgia \n\nMarch 15, 2023 \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 64 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n"
