We received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and commercialized our first product in 2006. We received FDA marketing authorization and launched our latest generation system, the Dexcom G6 &#174; integrated Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, or G6, in 2018 and more recently received marketing clearance from the FDA on the Dexcom G7 &#174; in December 2022. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;company,&#8221; or &#8220;Dexcom&#8221; refer to DexCom, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

The G6 was the first type of CGM system permitted by the FDA to be used as part of an integrated system with other compatible medical devices and electronic interfaces, which may include automated insulin delivery systems, insulin pumps, blood glucose meters or other electronic devices used for diabetes management. G6 and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type that may later receive marketing authorization are referred to as integrated continuous glucose monitoring systems, or iCGMs, and have been classified as Class II devices by the FDA. Along with this classification, the FDA established criteria, called special controls, which outline requirements for assuring CGM accuracy, reliability and clinical relevance, and which also describe the type of studies and data required to demonstrate acceptable CGM performance. The G6 is designed to allow our transmitter to run an algorithm to generate a glucose value and to communicate directly to a patient&#8217;s compatible mobile device, including iPhone &#174; , iPod touch &#174; , iPad &#174; , and certain Android &#174; mobile devices. A patient&#8217;s glucose data can also be displayed on wearable devices, like the Apple Watch &#174; and Wear OS by Google devices. The G6 transmitter has a labeled useful life of three months. Data from the G6 can be integrated with Dexcom CLARITY &#174; , our cloud-based reporting software, for personalized, easy-to-understand analysis of trends that may improve diabetes management. In the United States, the G6 is covered by Medicare and Medicaid in the majority of states and by commercial insurers, subject to satisfaction of certain eligibility and coverage criteria for individuals with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. \n\nIn June 2018, we received Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;enne Marking, or CE Mark, approval for the G6, which allows us to market the system in the European Union and the countries in Asia and Latin America that recognize the CE Mark, as well as New Zealand, though certain countries may require compliance with certain local administrative requirements and/or additional marketing authorizations (for example, the inclusion of medical devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods in Australia). \n\nIn October 2019, we also received marketing authorization from the FDA for the Dexcom G6 Pro, or G6 Pro, which allows healthcare professionals to purchase the G6 for use with their patients. The G6 Pro has many of same features as the G6 and is intended for healthcare professionals to use with their patients ages two years and up. The G6 Pro may be used in a blinded or unblinded mode for up to 10 days. \n\nFor the G6, the sensor is inserted by the user and is intended to be used continuously for up to 10 days, after which it may be replaced with a new disposable sensor. Our transmitter is reusable until it reaches the end of its use life, labeled as three months. Our receiver is also reusable. As we establish an installed base of customers using our products, we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable sensors. \n\nThe G6 carries forward important features of prior generation Dexcom CGM systems: \n\n&#8226; Continuous glucose readings. Automatically sends glucose readings to a Dexcom receiver or compatible display device every five minutes. \n\n&#8226; Mobile app and sharing. Compatibility with mobile device applications allows for sharing glucose information with up to 10 other people for added support and care coordination. \n\n&#8226; Integration with the world&#8217;s largest connected CGM ecosystem (including Apple Watch, Garmin and other digital health apps). \n\n&#8226; Customizable alarms and alerts. Personalized alert schedule immediately warns the user of pending dangerous high and low blood sugar levels. \n\nThe G6 also has a number of new or improved features compared to our prior generation devices: \n\n&#8226; Finger stick elimination. No finger sticks are needed for calibration or diabetes treatment decisions, consistent with the instructions for use, unless symptoms do not match readings. \n\n&#8226; Easy sensor application. Complete redesign of the sensor applicator allows for one-touch, simple self-insertion. \n\n&#8226; Discreet and low profile. A redesigned transmitter with a 28% lower profile than the previous generation Dexcom CGM system makes the device comfortable and easy to wear under clothing. \n\n&#8226; Medication blocking. Allows for more accurate glucose readings without interference from common medications taken at typical indication doses, such as acetaminophen. \n\n&#8226; Predictive low alert. Alert feature intended to predict hypoglycemia before it hits to help avoid dangerous low blood sugar events. \n\n&#8226; Extended 10-day disposable sensor. Up to 10-day sensor use allows for 43% longer wear than previous generation Dexcom CGM systems. \n\nOther than the foregoing, the features of the G6 are generally consistent with our prior generation CGM systems in its technical capabilities and its indications. Since the G6 is classified by the FDA as a Class II device, it is subject to special controls and modifications of, or revisions to, the device may be made under the 510(k) process. \n\nDexcom G7 &#174; \n\nIn March 2022, we obtained CE Mark approval for G7. In December 2022, we obtained marketing authorization from the FDA for the G7 via the 510(k) review process. Like the G6, the G7 is an iCGM, is classified as a Class II device by the FDA, and is subject to special controls. The glucose value algorithm, ability to communicate with approved display and mobile devices, and compatibility with CLARITY &#174; are all substantially equivalent in technical performance and capability to the G6. We are working to obtain reimbursement coverage by Medicare and Medicaid and by commercial insurers in the United States. \n\nDexcom G7 is now cleared in the United States for all people with diabetes ages two years and older, giving more people than ever access to a powerfully simple diabetes management solution. With an overall Mean Absolute Relative Difference, or MARD, of 8.2%, Dexcom G7 is the most accurate CGM cleared by the FDA, and is clinically proven to lower A1C (a blood test that provides information about average levels of blood glucose, over the prior three months), reduce hyper- and hypoglycemia and increase time in range. \n\nThe G7 carries forward important features of prior generation Dexcom CGM systems: \n\n&#8226; Finger stick elimination. No finger sticks are needed for calibration or diabetes treatment decisions, consistent with the instructions for use, unless symptoms do not match readings. \n\n&#8226; Continuous glucose readings. Automatically sends glucose readings to a Dexcom receiver or compatible display device every five minutes. \n\n&#8226; Mobile app and sharing. Compatibility with mobile device applications allows for sharing glucose information with up to 10 other people for added support and care coordination. \n\n&#8226; Designed to integrate with the world&#8217;s largest connected CGM ecosystem (including insulin pumps and smart insulin pens, Apple Watch, Garmin and other digital health apps). \n\n&#8226; Customizable alarms and alerts. Personalized alert schedule immediately warns the user of pending dangerous high and low blood sugar levels. \n\n&#8226; Easy sensor application. Complete redesign of the sensor applicator allows for one-touch, simple self-insertion. \n\n&#8226; Medication blocking. New feature allows for more accurate glucose readings without interference from common medications taken at typical indication doses, such as acetaminophen. \n\n&#8226; Predictive low alert. Alert feature intended to predict hypoglycemia before it hits to help avoid dangerous low blood sugar events. \n\n&#8226; Extended 10-day disposable sensor. \n\nThe G7 also has a number of new or improved features compared to our prior generation devices. \n\n&#8226; An even more discreet and low profile. A redesigned transmitter makes for an all-in-one wearable combining our sensor and transmitter that is 60% smaller than the G6, making it even more comfortable and easier to wear under clothing. \n\n&#8226; Faster warm up. 30-minute sensor warm up, fastest of any CGM on the market. \n\n&#8226; Expanded time to replace sensors. 12-hour grace period to replace finished sensors for a more seamless transition between sessions. \n\n&#8226; New mobile app. Redesigned and simplified mobile app with Dexcom Clarity integration. \n\n&#8226; Improved alert settings for enhanced discretion at the user&#8217;s option . \n\n&#8226; Redesigned receiver. The optional receiver is smaller, with a more vibrant, easier to read display. \n\n&#8226; New indications for use. Indicated in the United States for wear on the back of the upper arm for ages 2 years and older or the upper buttocks for ages 2-17 years old. \n\n&#8226; Less waste. Smaller plastic components and packaging, resulting in less waste than the G6. \n\nOther than the foregoing, the G7 is generally consistent with our prior generation CGM systems in its technical capabilities and its indications. Since the G7 is classified by the FDA as a Class II device, it is subject to special controls and modifications of, or revisions to, the device may be made under the 510(k) process. \n\nDexcom Share &#174; \n\nThe Dexcom Share remote monitoring system, offered for use with any current Dexcom system, uses an app on the patient&#8217;s compatible iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Android mobile device to securely and wirelessly transmit glucose information to the cloud and then to apps on the mobile devices of up to five designated recipients, or &#8220;followers,&#8221; who can remotely monitor a patient&#8217;s glucose information and receive alert notifications anywhere they have a wireless connection. A patient&#8217;s glucose data can also be displayed on a patient&#8217;s or follower&#8217;s wearable device, such as the Apple Watch and Wear OS by Google devices, when used in conjunction with the patient&#8217;s or follower&#8217;s compatible iPhone or Android mobile device. \n\nDexcom Real-Time API \n\nIn July 2021, we received FDA marketing clearance for an iCGM system incorporating our Real-Time Application Programming Interfaces (API), which is an added software component that expands connectivity and interoperability of the Dexcom CGM digital ecosystem, enabling communication of iCGM data to client software intended to receive data through the cloud. Dexcom Real-Time API enables authorized third-party software developers to integrate real-time CGM data into their digital health apps and devices for specific and permitted use cases including non-medical device application, medical device data analysis, iCGM secondary display alarm, active patient monitoring, and treatment decisions. Real-Time API is not permitted for use in environments not currently cleared for the Dexcom CGM System (e.g., hospital inpatient care), and is not intended to be used by automated insulin delivery systems. \n\nDexcom ONE &#174; \n\nIn July 2021, we obtained CE Mark approval for our Dexcom ONE CGM system, or Dexcom ONE, which we have launched in several countries in Europe. Dexcom ONE consists of three main components: a sensor, a transmitter, and a display device consisting of either the Dexcom ONE app for users with a compatible mobile device, or a Dexcom ONE receiver. Dexcom ONE carries many of the same features as the G6, and is indicated for persons, including pregnant women, ages 2 years and older. Like our other CGM systems, Dexcom ONE is designed to replace finger stick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions. \n\nData and Insulin Delivery Collaborations \n\nWe have entered into multiple collaboration agreements that leverage our technology platform to integrate our CGM products with insulin delivery systems. The general purpose of these development and commercial relationships is to integrate our technology into the insulin pump or pen product offerings of the respective partner, enabling the partner&#8217;s insulin delivery device to receive and display glucose readings from our transmitter and, in \n\nsome cases, use the glucose readings for semi-automated insulin delivery. Currently, we have announced significant insulin delivery partnerships with Eli Lilly, Insulet, Novo Nordisk, Tandem Diabetes and The Ypsomed Group. In addition to these major partners, we are working with other companies that are pursuing varying strategies surrounding semi-automated insulin delivery and data analytics to improve outcomes and ease-of-use in diabetes management. \n\nWe have also entered into collaborations with several organizations that are currently using, or are developing, programs for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes that utilize our current CGM systems. These collaborations align with the strategy to seek broader access to our CGM systems for people with Type 2 diabetes, including those who are not treated with intensive insulin therapy. \n\nVerily Collaboration \n\nOur Restated Collaboration Agreement with Verily Life Science LLC (an Alphabet Company) and Verily Ireland Limited (collectively, Verily) provides us with an exclusive license to use intellectual property of Verily resulting from the collaboration, and certain Verily patents, in the development, manufacture and commercialization of blood-based or interstitial glucose monitoring products more generally (subject to certain exclusions, which are outside the CGM field as it is commonly understood). It also provides us with non-exclusive license rights under Verily&#8217;s other intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize those kinds of glucose monitoring products and certain CGM product companion software functionalities. \n\nIn consideration of Verily&#8217;s performance of its obligations under the joint development plan of the Restated Collaboration Agreement, the licenses granted to us and the amendment of the original agreement, we have made upfront, incentive, and product regulatory approval milestone payments, and will make potential additional milestone payments for future sales-based milestones. At our election, we may make these payments in shares of our common stock or cash. If we elect to make these milestone payments in cash, any such cash payment would be equal to the number of shares that would otherwise be issued for the given milestone payment multiplied by the value of our stock on the date the relevant milestone is achieved, adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and the like. We intend to pay the sales-based contingent milestones in shares of our common stock. See Note 2 &#8220;Development and Other Agreements&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and Exhibit 10.15 of this Annual Report for a further description of the Restated Collaboration Agreement, including the number of shares of stock for milestone payments. \n\n##TABLE_START Market Opportunity ##TABLE_END\n\nDiabetes \n\nDiabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure and which has other significant adverse consequences for human health throughout the world. The disease is caused by the body&#8217;s inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin. This inability prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. Glucose, the primary source of energy for cells, must be maintained at certain concentrations in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. Normally, the pancreas provides control of blood glucose levels by secreting the hormone insulin to decrease blood glucose levels when concentrations are too high. In people with diabetes, the body does not produce sufficient levels of insulin, or fails to utilize insulin effectively, causing blood glucose levels to rise above normal. This condition is called hyperglycemia and often results in acute complications as well as chronic long-term complications such as heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function and blindness. When blood glucose levels are high, people with diabetes often administer insulin in an effort to decrease blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, insulin administration can drive blood glucose levels below the normal range, resulting in hypoglycemia. In cases of severe hypoglycemia, people with diabetes risk acute complications, such as loss of consciousness or death. Due to the drastic nature of acute complications associated with hypoglycemia, many people with diabetes are reluctant to reduce blood glucose levels. Consequently, these individuals often remain in a hyperglycemic state, increasing their odds of developing long-term chronic complications. Diabetes is typically classified into two major groups: Type 1 and Type 2. \n\nThe International Diabetes Federation, or IDF, estimates that in 2021, 537 million adults (aged 20-79) around the world had diabetes. IDF estimates that by 2045, the worldwide incidence of people suffering from diabetes will reach 783 million. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in its National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2022, or the 2022 CDC Report, crude estimates for the prevalence of diabetes in the United States as of 2019 include 37.3 million people with diabetes, of which 28.7 million people have diagnosed diabetes. The 2022 CDC Report also lists diabetes as the seventh leading cause of death by disease in the United States, excluding comorbidities associated with the disease. The report states that diabetes is the primary cause of death for more than 87,000 Americans each year, and contributes to the death of more than 280,000 Americans annually. According to the Congressional Diabetes Caucus website, diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult-onset blindness, lower-limb amputations, and a significant cause of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and nerve damage. According to the IDF, there were an estimated 6.7 million deaths attributable to diabetes globally in 2021 between the ages of 20 and 79 years. \n\nThis growing diabetes prevalence and its associated health outcomes also result in sobering economic burdens for global health systems. According to the ADA, one in every four healthcare dollars was spent on treating people with diabetes in 2017, and the direct medical costs and indirect expenditures attributable to diabetes in the United States were an estimated $327 billion, an inflation-adjusted increase of approximately 26% since 2012. Of the $327 billion in overall expenses, the ADA estimated that approximately $237 billion were direct costs associated with diabetes care, chronic complications and excess general medical costs, and $90 billion were indirect costs. The ADA also found that in 2017, average medical expenditures among people with diagnosed diabetes were 2.3 times higher than for people without diabetes. According to the IDF, 2021 expenditures attributable to diabetes were estimated to be $966 billion globally, an increase of 27% from their previous estimate in 2019. \n\nType 1 Diabetes \n\nAccording to the 2022 CDC Report, as of 2019 there were an estimated 1.8 million adults and youth with diagnosed Type 1 diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that usually develops during childhood and is characterized by an absence of insulin, resulting from destruction of the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes must rely on frequent insulin injections in order to regulate and maintain blood glucose levels. \n\nAccording to JDRF, greater than 60,000 people are diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes each year in the United States. In addition, according to the ADA in 2019, nearly 18,000 youth are newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes every year in the United States. \n\nType 2 Diabetes \n\nType 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder which results when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or becomes insulin resistant. Depending on the severity of Type 2 diabetes, individuals may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or insulin injections to regulate blood glucose levels. We estimate that between 5.0 and 6.0 million people with Type 2 diabetes in the United States must use insulin to manage their diabetes. \n\nType 2 diabetes is occurring with increasing frequency in young people, with the increase in prevalence related to an increase in obesity amongst children. According to the CDC, as of 2017-2020, approximately 19.7% of children and adolescents aged 2-19 years, or 14.7 million children, in the United States were obese. In the United States, the percentage of children and adolescents affected by obesity has more than tripled since the 1970s. \n\nImportance of Glucose Monitoring \n\nBlood glucose levels can be affected by many factors, including the carbohydrate and fat content of meals, exercise, stress, illness or impending illness, hormonal releases, variability in insulin absorption and changes in the effects of insulin in the body. Given the many factors that affect blood glucose levels, maintaining glucose within a normal range is difficult, resulting in frequent and unpredictable excursions above or below normal blood glucose levels. People with diabetes administer insulin or ingest carbohydrates throughout the day in order to maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges. People with diabetes frequently overcorrect and fluctuate between hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic states, often multiple times during the same day. As a result, many people with diabetes are routinely outside the normal blood glucose range. Failure to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range leads to numerous and significant health risks. These risks include eye disease, nerve disease, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and potentially hypoglycemic events. \n\nLimitations of Existing Glucose Monitoring Products \n\nSingle-point finger stick devices are the most prevalent devices for glucose monitoring. These devices require taking a blood sample with a finger stick, placing a drop of blood on a test strip and inserting the strip into a glucose meter that yields a single point in time blood glucose measurement. We believe that these devices suffer from several limitations, including: \n\n&#8226; Limited Information. Even if people with diabetes test several times each day, each measurement represents a single blood glucose value at a single point in time. Given the many factors that can affect blood glucose levels, excursions above and below the normal range often occur between these discrete measurement points in time. Without the ability to determine whether their blood glucose level is rising, falling or holding constant, and the rate at which their blood glucose level is changing, the individual&#8217;s ability to effectively manage and maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges is severely limited. Further, people with diabetes cannot test themselves during sleep, when the risk of hypoglycemia is significantly increased. \n\nThe illustrative graph below shows the limited information provided by four single-point measurements during a single day using a traditional single-point finger stick device, compared to the data provided by our continuous sensor. The continuous data indicates that, even with four finger sticks in one day, the patient&#8217;s blood glucose levels were above the target range of 80-140 milligrams per deciliter (&#8220;mg/dl&#8221;) for a period of 13.5 hours. \n\nSingle Day Continuous Data \n\n&#8226; Inconvenience. The process of measuring blood glucose levels with single-point finger stick devices can cause significant disruption in the daily activities of people with diabetes and their families. People with diabetes using single-point finger stick devices must stop whatever they are doing several times per day, self-inflict a painful prick and draw blood to measure blood glucose levels. To do so, people with diabetes must always carry a fully supplied kit that may include a spring-loaded needle, or lancet, disposable test strips, cleansing wipes and the meter, and then safely dispose of the used supplies. This process is inconvenient and may cause uneasiness in social situations. \n\n&#8226; Difficulty of Use. To obtain a sample with single-point finger stick devices, people with diabetes generally prick one of their fingertips or, occasionally, a forearm with a lancet. They then squeeze the area to produce the blood sample and another prick may be required if a sufficient volume of blood is not obtained the first time. The blood sample is then placed on a disposable test strip that is inserted into a blood glucose meter. This task can be difficult for individuals with decreased tactile sensation and visual acuity, which are common complications of diabetes. \n\n&#8226; Pain. Although the fingertips are rich in blood flow and provide a good site to obtain a blood sample, they are also densely populated with highly sensitive nerve endings. This makes the lancing and subsequent manipulation of the finger to draw blood painful. The pain and discomfort are compounded by the fact that fingers offer limited surface area, so tests are often performed on areas that are sore from prior tests. People with diabetes may also suffer pain when the finger prick site is disturbed during regular activities. \n\nThe Dexcom Approach \n\nWe believe continuous glucose monitoring has the potential to enable more people with diabetes to achieve and sustain tight glycemic control with minimal disruption to their daily lives. \n\nThe landmark 1993 Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, or DCCT, demonstrated that improving blood glucose control lowers the risk of developing diabetes-related complications by up to 50%. The study also demonstrated that people with Type 1 diabetes achieved sustained benefits with intensive management. However, according to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November 2014, in two national registries, only 13% to 15% of people with diabetes met treatment guidelines for good glycemic control, and more than 20% had very poor glycemic control. \n\nVarious clinical studies and real-world evidence also demonstrate the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring in the management of Type 1 diabetes and insulin-requiring Type-2 diabetes, when compared to regimens relying on self-monitoring of blood glucose. Results of several early clinical trials established that CGM usage was associated with improved glycemic outcomes. \n\nReal-time alerts and multi-device integration further differentiate CGM-based and self-monitoring of blood glucose, or SMBG, based diabetes regimens. Alerts triggered by existing or impending abnormal glucose values are associated with less exposure to hypo- and hyperglycemia in large real-world data sets, and multi-device integration allows some CGM systems to communicate with automated insulin delivery systems. One such automated insulin delivery system that uses the G6 was studied in a large clinical trial that associated its use with numerous quality-of-life and glycemic benefits. \n\nOur current target market consists primarily of people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes who utilize insulin therapy. We also believe that our CGM systems are beginning to have a positive impact on the broader Type 2 population that does not utilize insulin, a group that we estimate to be approximately 30 million people in the United States alone. We are extending our commercial efforts for this population through several channels, including through strategic partnerships. In the future, we plan to expand our product offering and cleared/approved indications to address people with pre-diabetes, people who are obese, people who are pregnant, and people in the hospital setting. Although the majority of our revenue has been generated in the United States, we have expanded our operations to include additional markets in North America, Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. \n\nOur current CGM systems offer the following potential advantages to people with diabetes: \n\n&#8226; Potential for Improved Outcomes. Randomized clinical trials and peer reviewed published data have demonstrated that patients with diabetes who used continuous glucose monitoring devices to help manage their disease experienced significant improvements in glucose control, including when compared to patients relying solely on single-point finger stick measurements (i.e., less time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia) and reductions in A1c levels when compared to baseline. \n\n&#8226; Access to Real-Time Values, Trend Information and Alerts. People with diabetes can view their current glucose value, along with a graphical display of the historical trend information on our receiver or alternate display device. Without continuous monitoring, the individual is often unaware if his or her glucose is rising, declining or remaining constant. Access to continuous real-time glucose measurements provides people with diabetes information that may aid in attaining better glucose control. Additionally, our current CGM systems alert people with diabetes when their glucose levels approach inappropriately high or low levels so that they may intervene. \n\n&#8226; Intuitive User Interface. We have developed a user interface that we believe is intuitive and easy to use. Our current CGM system receivers are compact with an easy-to-read color display, simple navigation tools, audible alerts and graphical display of trend information. Similar benefits are available via the interfaces we have made available on compatible mobile devices. These devices can serve as substitutes for our receivers or alternate display units in certain geographies. \n\n&#8226; Convenience and Comfort. Our current CGM systems provide people with diabetes with the benefits of continuous monitoring, without having to perform finger stick tests for every measurement. Additionally, the disposable sensor that is inserted under the skin is a very thin wire, minimizing potential discomfort associated with inserting or wearing the disposable sensor. The external portion of the sensor, attached to the transmitter, is small, has a low profile and is designed to be easily worn under clothing. The wireless receiver is the size of a small smart phone and can be carried discreetly in a pocket or purse. We believe that convenience is an important factor in achieving widespread adoption of a CGM system. \n\n&#8226; Connectivity to Wearables and Others. Patients can monitor their glucose levels and trends on compatible wearable devices, such as Apple Watch and Wear OS by Google devices, when used with a compatible mobile device. Also, our Share remote monitoring systems enable users of our current CGM systems to have their sensor glucose information remotely monitored by their family, friends or other designated recipient, or follower, by wirelessly transmitting data from the user&#8217;s smart phone to the cloud and then to the follower&#8217;s mobile device. Several followers can remotely monitor a patient&#8217;s glucose information and receive secondary alert notifications from almost anywhere with an Internet connection via each follower&#8217;s mobile device. \n\nOur Strategy \n\nOur objective is to remain a leading provider of CGM systems and related products to enable people with diabetes to more effectively and conveniently manage their condition. We are also developing and commercializing products that integrate our CGM technologies into the insulin delivery systems or data platforms of our respective partners. In addition, we continue to pursue development partnerships with other insulin delivery companies, including automated insulin delivery systems, as well as other players in the disease management sector. We are focusing on the following business strategies as we pursue these objectives: \n\n&#8226; Establishing and maintaining our technology platform as the leading approach to CGM and leveraging our development expertise to rapidly bring products to market, including for expanded indications. \n\n&#8226; Supporting use of our ambulatory products through a direct sales and marketing effort, as well as key distribution arrangements. \n\n&#8226; Supporting innovation through technology integration partnerships such as our current partnerships with Eli Lilly, Insulet, Novo Nordisk, Tandem Diabetes, The Ypsomed Group and others globally. \n\n&#8226; Seeking broad coverage policies and reimbursement for our products from private third-party payors and national health systems. \n\n&#8226; Providing cloud-based data repository platform that enables people with diabetes to aggregate and analyze data from numerous diabetes devices and share the data with their healthcare providers and other individuals involved in their diabetes management and care. \n\n&#8226; Pursuing expansion of use of our products to other patient care settings and patient demographics, including use for people with Type 2 diabetes who are not on intensive insulin therapy, population health, patient monitoring including in the hospital setting, and people who are pregnant. \n\n&#8226; Providing a high level of customer support, service and education. \n\n&#8226; Pursuing the highest safety and quality levels for our products. \n\n##TABLE_START Our Technology Platform ##TABLE_END\n\nWe believe we have a broad technology platform that will support the development of multiple products for continuous glucose monitoring. \n\nSensor Technology \n\nThe key enabling technologies for our sensors include biomaterials, membrane systems, electrochemistry and low power microelectronics. Our membrane technology consists of multiple polymer layers configured to selectively allow the appropriate mix of glucose and oxygen to travel through the membrane and react with a glucose specific enzyme to create an extremely low electrical signal, measured in pico-amperes. This electrical signal is then translated into glucose values. We believe that the capability to measure very low levels of an electrical signal and to accurately translate those measurements into glucose values is also a unique and distinguishing feature of our technology. We have also developed technology to allow sensitive electronics to be packaged in a small, fully contained, lightweight sealed unit that minimizes inconvenience and discomfort for the user. \n\nReceiver and Transmitter Technology \n\nOur current CGM systems wirelessly transmit information from the transmitter, which sits in a pod atop the sensor, to our receiver or to a compatible mobile device. We have developed technology for reliable transmission and reception and have consistently demonstrated a high rate of successful transmissions from transmitter to receiver or compatible mobile device in our clinical trials. Our receiver or the mobile device, via our apps, then displays both real-time and trended glucose values, and provides alerts and alarms. We have used our extensive database of continuous glucose data to create and refine software, algorithms and other technology for the display of data to customers. \n\nDisposable Sensor and Reusable Transmitter \n\nOur sensor includes a tiny wire-like electrode coated with our sensing membrane system. This disposable sensor comes packaged with an integrated insertion device and is contained in a small plastic housing platform, or pod. The base of the pod has adhesive that attaches it to the skin. The sensor is intended to be easily and reliably inserted by the user by exposing the adhesive, placing the pod against the surface of the skin of the abdomen or upper buttocks for people ages 2-17, and pushing down on the insertion device. The insertion device first extends a narrow gauge needle containing the sensor into the subcutaneous tissue and then retracts the needle, leaving behind the sensor in the tissue and the pod adhered to the skin. The user then disposes of the insertion device and snaps the transmitter to the pod. \n\nAfter a stabilization period, the user will begin receiving CGM data on his or her mobile device or dedicated receiver through the ten-day usage period. Our G6 and G7 systems have labeling from the FDA and CE Mark permitting their use as a replacement for finger sticks for making therapeutic adjustments. \n\nThe disposable sensors contained in the G6 and G7 systems respectively are each intended to function for up to ten days, after which the sensor should be replaced. To replace a sensor, the user simply removes the pod and attached sensor from the skin and discards them while retaining the reusable transmitter. A new sensor and pod can then be inserted and used with the same receiver and transmitter for a subsequent use period. \n\nHandheld Receiver \n\nOur small handheld receiver is carried by the user and wirelessly receives continuous glucose values from the transmitter. Proprietary algorithms and software, developed from our extensive database of continuous glucose data from clinical trials, are programmed into the G6 and G7 transmitter to process the glucose data from the sensor, which then sends the processed glucose data to the receiver and displays it on a user-friendly graphical user interface. With a push of a button, the user can access their current glucose value and one-, three-, six-, twelve- and twenty-four-hour trended data. Additionally, when glucose values are inappropriately high or low, the receiver provides an audible alert or vibrates. The receiver is a self-contained, durable unit with a rechargeable battery. \n\nCompatible Mobile Devices \n\nWith our G6 and G7 systems, the functionalities of our proprietary receiver can be obtained through the use of a compatible mobile device, such as an iOS or Android device, and our mobile applications, depending on the patient&#8217;s geographic location. A receiver may be required as the primary display device or a backup to the mobile device in some jurisdictions, including the United States. \n\nProducts in Development \n\nWe have gained our technology expertise by developing implants designed to withstand the rigors of functioning within the human body for extended periods of time, and designed to address other considerations such as device sealing, miniaturization, durability and sensor geometry. \n\nWe are leveraging this technology platform with the goal of enhancing the capabilities of our current products (including obtaining expanded indications for use) and to develop additional CGM products. We plan to develop future generations of technologies focused on improved performance and convenience that will enable intelligent insulin administration. Over the longer term, we plan to continue to develop and improve networked platforms with open architecture, connectivity and transmitters capable of communicating with other devices. We intend to expand our efforts to accumulate CGM patient data and metrics and apply predictive modeling and machine learning to generate interactive CGM insights with the potential to inform patient behavior. \n\nWe continue to pursue and support development partnerships with insulin pump companies and companies or institutions developing insulin delivery systems, including automated insulin delivery systems. \n\nWe are also exploring how to extend our offerings to other populations, including for people with Type 2 diabetes that are non-insulin using, people with pre-diabetes, people who are obese, people who are pregnant, and people in the hospital setting. Eventually, we may apply our technological expertise to products beyond glucose monitoring. \n\n##TABLE_START Commercial Operations ##TABLE_END\n\nWe have built a direct sales organization in North America and certain international markets to call on health care professionals, such as endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators, who can educate patients about continuous glucose monitoring. We believe that focusing efforts on these participants is important given the instrumental role they each play in the decision-making process for diabetes therapy, and to ensure that health care \n\nprofessionals and patients are knowledgeable about our products and their functionality. We focus on delivering this important information to participants to drive adoption of our current CGM systems. In addition, our direct sales efforts include the use of e-commerce resources in certain international markets where we have not built a sales force. \n\nTo complement our direct sales efforts, we have entered into distribution arrangements in North America and several international markets that allow distributors to sell our products. We expect to continue investing in our field sales force and believe our direct, highly specialized and focused sales organization and our domestic and international distribution agreements are sufficient for us to support our sales efforts for at least the next twelve months. \n\nWe use a variety of marketing tools to drive adoption, ensure continued use and establish brand loyalty for our CGM systems by: \n\n&#8226; creating awareness of the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring and the advantages of our technology with endocrinologists, physicians, diabetes educators and people with diabetes; \n\n&#8226; providing strong and simple educational and training programs to healthcare providers and people with diabetes to ensure easy, safe and effective use of our systems; and \n\n&#8226; maintaining a readily accessible telephone and web-based technical and customer support infrastructure, which includes clinicians, diabetes educators and reimbursement specialists, to help referring physicians, diabetes educators and people with diabetes as necessary. \n\nDirect-to-consumer (DTC) marketing is one of our key initiatives to increase awareness of our CGM systems and drive new leads for people with diabetes to our website. In jurisdictions where DTC marketing is permitted, we currently focus on reaching people with Type 1 and insulin intensive Type 2 diabetes. We advertise on television, in print, digital and video media, CRM, offer sponsorships, host or participate in diabetes related events, conduct public relations and maintain a brand ambassador program. \n\nWe typically experience seasonality, with lower sales in the first quarter of each year compared to the immediately preceding fourth quarter. This seasonal sales pattern relates to U.S. annual insurance deductible resets and unfunded flexible spending accounts. \n\n##TABLE_START Competition ##TABLE_END\n\nThe market for glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. In selling our current CGM systems, we compete directly with the Diabetes Care division of Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic plc&#8217;s Diabetes Group; Roche Diabetes Care, a division of Roche Diagnostics; privately-held LifeScan, Inc.; and Ascensia Diabetes Care, each of which manufactures and markets products for the single-point finger stick device market. Collectively, these companies currently account for the majority of the worldwide sales of self-monitored glucose testing systems. \n\nSeveral companies are developing or commercializing products for continuous or periodic monitoring of glucose levels in the interstitial fluid under the skin that compete directly with our products. We have competed with Abbott and their Libre family of CGM products for many years. Medtronic markets and sells a standalone glucose monitoring product called Guardian Connect, both internationally and in the United States. \n\nMedtronic and other third parties have developed or are developing, insulin pumps integrated with continuous glucose monitoring systems that provide, among other things, the ability to suspend insulin administration while the user&#8217;s glucose levels are low and to automate basal or bolus insulin dosing. \n\nWe are also aware of companies outside the traditional medical device sector that are attempting to develop competitive products and services, including for the general health and wellness, or population health space. Some of the companies developing or marketing competing devices are large and well-known publicly traded companies. \n\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include: \n\n&#8226; safe, reliable and high-quality performance of products; \n\n&#8226; cost of products and eligibility for reimbursement; \n\n&#8226; comfort and ease of use of products; \n\n&#8226; effective sales, marketing and distribution networks; \n\n&#8226; brand awareness and strong acceptance by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes; \n\n&#8226; customer service and support and comprehensive education for people with diabetes and diabetes care providers; \n\n&#8226; speed of product innovation and time to market; \n\n&#8226; regulatory expertise; and \n\n&#8226; technological leadership and superiority. \n\nFor additional information on competition, please see our Risk Factor entitled &#8220; We operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from large, well-established companies with significant resources, and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_START Manufacturing ##TABLE_END\n\nWe currently manufacture our products at our headquarters in San Diego, California and at our manufacturing facility in Mesa, Arizona, where we have approximately 46,800 square feet of laboratory space and approximately 85,200 square feet of controlled environment rooms. We are also near completion of the initial phase of construction of a new facility in Malaysia that we anticipate will add substantial manufacturing capacity. There are technical challenges to increasing manufacturing capacity, finding or enhancing new manufacturing facilities capable of meeting regulatory requirements, U.S. state licensure of manufacturing facilities, equipment design and automation, material procurement, problems with production yields, and quality control and assurance. We have focused significant effort on continual improvement programs in our manufacturing operations intended to improve quality, yields and throughput. We have made progress in manufacturing to enable us to supply adequate amounts of product to support our commercialization efforts, however we cannot guarantee that supply will not be constrained going forward. Additionally, the production of our continuous glucose monitoring systems must occur in a highly controlled and clean environment to minimize particles and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. Developing and maintaining commercial-scale manufacturing facilities has and will continue to require the investment of substantial additional funds and the hiring and retention of additional management, quality assurance, quality control and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. \n\nWe manufacture our current CGM systems with certain components supplied by outside vendors and other components that we manufacture internally. Key components that we manufacture internally include our wire-based sensors. The remaining components and assemblies are purchased from outside vendors. We then assemble, test, package and ship the finished systems, which may include a reusable transmitter, a receiver and disposable sensors. \n\nWe purchase certain components and materials used in manufacturing from single sources due to quality considerations, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory or other requirements. As of December 31, 2022, those single sources include suppliers of application-specific integrated circuits used in our transmitters, seals used for the applicator and certain polymers used to synthesize polymeric membranes for our sensors. For additional information, please see our Risk Factor entitled, &#8220; We depend upon third-party suppliers and outsource to other parties, making us vulnerable to supply disruptions, suboptimal quality, non-compliance and/or price fluctuations, which could harm our business .&#8221; For supply risks related to COVID-19, see our Risk Factor entitled &#8220; The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants and the COVID-19 disease that it causes, or similar public health crises, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our manufacturing, commercial operations and sales .&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_START Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement ##TABLE_END\n\nAs a medical device company, coverage and reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs or systems, and private third-party healthcare payors is an important element of our success. In January 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, established a classification of &#8220;Therapeutic Continuous Glucose Monitors&#8221; as durable medical equipment under Medicare Part B, subject to payment by Medicare under certain coverage conditions which are determined and updated by CMS, by local Medicare Administrative Contractors or on a patient claim by claim basis. In December 2021, CMS published a final rule expanding the classification of DME under Medicare Parts B &#38; C to also include adjunctive CGMs (i.e., CGMs do not replace standard blood glucose monitors for treatment decisions) and related supplies. We also have coverage under certain international markets and Medicaid coverage in about 45 states. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the eight largest private third-party payors, in terms of the number of covered lives, have issued coverage policies for the category of continuous glucose monitoring devices. In addition, we have negotiated contracted rates with all of those third-party payors for the purchase of our current CGM systems by their members. We have personnel with reimbursement expertise to assist customers in obtaining reimbursement from \n\nprivate third-party payors. We also maintain a field-based reimbursement team charged with calling on third-party private payors to obtain coverage decisions and contracts. We have continued our efforts to create and liberalize coverage policies with third-party payors, including obtaining reimbursement for our products under pharmacy benefits and for more people with diabetes. \n\nFor additional information on third-party reimbursement, please see our see Risk Factors entitled &#8220; Managed care trends and consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.&#8221; and &#8220; Health care policy changes, including U.S. health care reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our business .&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_START Intellectual Property ##TABLE_END\n\nProtection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. \n\nOur patent portfolio includes numerous issued and pending patent applications in the U.S. and other parts of the world, which in the aggregate, we believe to be of material importance in the operation of our business. U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application was filed. In some cases, the patent term may be extended. Our issued patents as of December 31, 2022 are set to expire over a range of years, from 2023 with respect to some of our earlier patents, to 2041, subject to any extensions. We also have various registered U.S. trademarks, registered European Community trademarks, and many other trademark registrations and pending trademark applications around other parts of the world. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business relating to a wide array of technologies or other intellectual property rights or assets. \n\nOur patents and patent applications seek to protect aspects of our core membrane and sensor technologies and our product concepts for continuous glucose monitoring. We believe that our patent position provides us with sufficient rights to protect our current and proposed commercial products. However, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any patents that have been issued or might be issued may not protect our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation, and our patents may not be upheld if challenged. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid or unenforceable, and patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. Third parties may also independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. The steps we have taken may not prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We also face risks associated with intellectual property infringement. \n\nWe also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also generally require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. We cannot guarantee that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nSustainability \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe believe that taking into account the interests of our various stakeholders &#8211; including patients, caregivers, employees, investors, and our communities &#8211; enables us to operate in a sustainable manner, supports the success of our business and drives long-term value. We do this by holding true to our core values: Listen, Think Big, Be Dependable, and Serve with Integrity. These values are at the heart of our sustainability initiatives. \n\n&#8226; Listen &#8211; We believe in listening to our customers and our employees. We have launched a number of programs to advocate for individuals living with diabetes and we support our employees and their families through a number of benefit programs that are available. In addition, we promote diversity, practice fairness, and treat everyone with respect and dignity. \n\n&#8226; Think Big &#8211; We seek to expand global healthcare access for people with diabetes and actively work to increase access to our products. We also have committed to operate our business in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and conserves natural resources and reduces waste. \n\n&#8226; Be Dependable &#8211; We are committed to quality and believe that is best achieved through a safe and healthy workplace as well as a Quality Management System that is compliant with all applicable regulatory requirements and which is continuously being improved. \n\n&#8226; Serve with Integrity &#8211; While oversight of our ethics and governance structure begins with our Board of Directors and Executive Leadership Team, we expect all employees to foster a culture of accountability in line with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. We also maintain a compliance program to help enforce ethical conduct and adherence to applicable laws and regulations. \n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees and reviews Dexcom&#8217;s environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) risks, opportunities, strategies, programs, policies, practices, measures, objectives and performance relating to ESG matters. Our management-level ESG Steering Committee, which is comprised of the functional leads from our Operations, Human Capital, Finance and Legal departments, is responsible for, among other things, setting the overall strategy with respect to ESG matters (subject to direction from the Chief Executive Officer and oversight of the NG Committee), establishing programs, policies and practices relating to ESG matters (&#8220;DexCom&#8217;s ESG Program&#8221;) and overseeing and monitoring the implementation of DexCom&#8217;s ESG Program. The ESG Steering Committee reports to our Chief Executive Officer and provides periodic updates regarding our ESG programs, policies and practices to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. \n\nOur Sustainability Report is available at https://investors.dexcom.com/governance/governance-documents/, which is provided for reference only and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n##TABLE_START Government Regulation ##TABLE_END\n\nThe medical devices that we manufacture are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution. In addition, healthcare regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world impose a range of requirements related to the payment for medical devices and the procedures in which they are used, including laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of healthcare dollars. \n\nU.S. Laws and Regulations \n\nAt the U.S. federal level, our products are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA. The U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, referred to as the FDCA, and the FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance, authorization or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, product labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, product sales, distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. A number of U.S. states also impose licensing and compliance regimes on companies that manufacture or distribute prescription devices in the state. \n\nIn addition, the delivery of our devices in the U.S market is subject to regulation by various U.S. Department of Health and Human Services divisions including CMS, the DHHS Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and comparable state agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of payment for health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE programs, as well as the government&#8217;s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care. \n\nFDA Regulation \n\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require either prior 510(k) clearance, prior de novo down-classification and a related grant of marketing authorization, or prior approval from the FDA through the premarket approval, or PMA process. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification, and adherence to the FDA&#8217;s manufacturing requirements, which are contained in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market \n\nsurveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, as well as general controls. Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification (i.e., 510(k) clearance) requirement, and/or the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. As an example, the mobile applications that comprise the Share System were classified by the FDA as Class II exempt. With the mobile applications classified as Class II exempt, we must comply with certain general and special controls required by the FDA but we do not need prior FDA review to commercialize changes to the mobile applications. Some devices are placed in Class III, which requires approval of a PMA application, if they are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or to be &#8220;not substantially equivalent&#8221; either to a previously 510(k) cleared device or to a &#8220;preamendment&#8221; Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which PMA applications have not been required. \n\nIf a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. Under FDA law, the de novo classification procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the FDA agrees with the down-classification, the de novo applicant will then receive authorization to market the device, and a classification regulation will be established for the device type. The device can then be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions by the manufacturer or a competitor. \n\nA PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. \n\nFDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons. \n\nIf an FDA evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions which must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also determine that additional trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. \n\nNew PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. \n\nClinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s IDE regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of Good Clinical Practice requirements, which include among other things, recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA&#8217;s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; \n\n&#8226; patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect; \n\n&#8226; patients do not comply with trial protocols; \n\n&#8226; patient follow-up is not at the rate we expect; \n\n&#8226; patients experience adverse side effects; \n\n&#8226; patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to our products; \n\n&#8226; institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocol; \n\n&#8226; third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements; \n\n&#8226; Dexcom or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans; \n\n&#8226; third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to Dexcom or the study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or Dexcom or investigators fail to disclose such interests; \n\n&#8226; regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; \n\n&#8226; changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions applicable to our trial protocols, including, for example, recent legislation passed by Congress requiring clinical trial sponsors to increase engagement with the FDA on matters related to appropriate representation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trial data for pivotal studies; \n\n&#8226; the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness; and \n\n&#8226; the FDA concludes that the results from our trial and/or trial design are inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product. \n\nIn addition to our CGM device, we have a Class I data management service which we market to clinics. This service helps healthcare providers and patients see, understand and use blood glucose meter data to diagnose and manage diabetes. The service also allows researchers to control the transfer of data from certain diabetes devices to research tools and databases according to their own research workflows. \n\nThe infrastructure of the data management service is considered &#8220;medical device data systems,&#8221; or MDDS. MDDS are hardware or software products that transfer, store, convert formats, and display medical device data. An MDDS does not modify the data or modify the display of the data, and it does not by itself control the functions or parameters of any other medical device. MDDS are not intended to be used for active patient monitoring. The 21st Century Cures Act excluded certain software functions from the definition of &#8220;device&#8221;, thus products meeting the definition of MDDS (which previously might have been regulated as Class I, 510(k)-exempt devices) are no longer considered devices and thus are not subject to FDA regulatory requirements. \n\nAdditional functions of, or intended uses for, our software platform may require us to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA. \n\nAfter a device is authorized for marketing and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: \n\n&#8226; establishment registration and device listing; \n\n&#8226; QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, storage, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; \n\n&#8226; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses or indications and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion; \n\n&#8226; medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; \n\n&#8226; voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and/or could be a risk to health; and \n\n&#8226; corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. \n\nAlso, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or order us to establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services enforce regulatory requirements by conducting \n\nperiodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. \n\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of our clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions: \n\n&#8226; warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action; \n\n&#8226; fines and civil penalties; \n\n&#8226; unanticipated expenditures; \n\n&#8226; delays in approving or refusal to approve our future continuous glucose monitoring systems or other products; \n\n&#8226; FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export our products for sale in other countries; \n\n&#8226; suspension or withdrawal of FDA approval; \n\n&#8226; product recall or seizure; \n\n&#8226; interruption of production; \n\n&#8226; operating restrictions; \n\n&#8226; injunctions; and \n\n&#8226; criminal prosecution. \n\nWe and our contract manufacturers, specification developers, and some suppliers of components or device accessories, are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to comply with all applicable FDA regulations. \n\nU.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Compliance Requirements \n\nThe healthcare industry is subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. \n\nAnti-kickback Laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either (i) the referral of an individual, or (ii) purchasing, ordering, recommending, or arranging for the purchase or order of a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments to consultants, waiver of payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Given the breadth of this prohibition, Congress has issued a number of exceptions and has granted authority to the OIG to issue safe harbor regulations, each of which set forth certain provisions which, if satisfied in their entirety, will exempt an arrangement from being found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more exceptions or safe harbors is not per se illegal; rather, each arrangement is subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine whether the requisite improper intent exists. Therefore, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable exception or safe harbor element may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities or invite litigation by private citizens under federal whistleblower laws. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony and conviction could result in the assessment of fines of up to $100,000 per violation or imprisonment for up to 10 years or both. \n\nFederal Civil False Claims Act. The federal Civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented a false claim or the knowing use of false statements or records to obtain payment from the federal government. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may \n\nbe subject to repayment of three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals (known as &#8220;relators&#8221; or, more commonly, as &#8220;whistleblowers&#8221;) may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. These whistleblower-initiated False Claims Act cases are commonly referred to as &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions. False Claims Act cases may also be initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice or any of its local U.S. Attorneys&#8217; Offices. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, even before the validity of the claim is established and even if the government decides not to intervene in the lawsuit. Healthcare companies may decide to agree to large settlements with the government and/or whistleblowers to avoid the cost and negative publicity associated with litigation. Federal enforcement agencies also have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical and medical device companies&#8217; product promotion, health care professional engagements, and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is also possible for knowingly making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. \n\nFederal Physician Self-Referral Law. The Federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, including durable medical equipment such as the CGM receiver and supplies, payable by Medicare, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to the Medicare program for such designated health services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and provides that certain collections related to any such claims must be refunded in a timely manner. Exceptions to the Stark Law include, among other things, exceptions for certain financial relationships, including both ownership and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, therefore, to the extent that the statute is implicated and an exception does not apply, the statute is violated. Violations of the Stark Law must be reported and payment for improper referrals returned to Medicare in order to avoid potential liability under the federal False Claims Act for avoiding a known obligation to return identified overpayments. In the fall of 2020, we transitioned our Medicare business to distributors and we no longer bill Medicare directly for DME and related supplies. In doing so, we have limited our exposure under the Stark Law. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have implemented similar physician self-referral prohibitions that may extend to Medicaid, third party payors, and self-pay patients, and may be applicable to our relationships with physicians and other health care providers. \n\nCivil Monetary Penalties Law . The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or CMPL, authorizes the imposition of substantial civil money penalties against an entity that engages in certain prohibited activities including but not limited to violations of the Stark Law or Anti-Kickback Statute, knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim, employment of an individual excluded from participation in federal health care programs, and the provision or offer of anything of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the transferring party knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary&#8217;s selection of a particular provider or supplier from which to receive items or services for which payment may be made in whole or part by a federal health care program, commonly known as the Beneficiary Inducement CMP. Remuneration is defined under the CMPL as any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value. There are certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for offerings that meet the Financial Need, Preventative Care, or Promoting Access to Care exceptions. Sanctions for violations of the CMPL include civil monetary penalties and administrative penalties up to and including exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. \n\nViolations of the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and/or the federal False Claims Act can also form the basis for exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. \n\nState Analogs of Federal Fraud and Abuse Laws . Many U.S. states have their own laws intended to protect against fraud and abuse in the health care industry and more broadly. In some cases these laws prohibit or regulate additional conduct beyond that covered under federal law. Penalties for violating these laws can range from fines to criminal sanctions. \n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and implementing regulations, collectively HIPAA, created two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to \n\ndefraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. \n\nHIPAA and Other U.S. Privacy Laws and Regulations. HIPAA, as well as a number of other federal and state data protection laws, also extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, and other personal information. HIPAA requires covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of covered information (known as &#8220;protected health information&#8221;) and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures that may be made of such information without the authorization of the relevant individual. Certain provisions of HIPAA&#8217;s security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to criminal and civil penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay and notification must also be made to the U.S. Department of Health &#38; Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. Various U.S. state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals and state agencies in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. The OCR enforces the HIPAA regulations and performs compliance audits. \n\nOn December 1, 2022, OCR issued a bulletin on the requirements under HIPAA for online tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, pixels) to protect the privacy and security of health information. This bulletin outlined OCR&#8217;s position on the use of online tracking technology vendors, when certain information received by such vendors constitutes protected health information under HIPAA, and accordingly, when business associate agreements must be executed between covered entities, like Dexcom, and such vendors. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. Dexcom is a covered entity under HIPAA and in certain circumstances may also be a business associate of another covered entity. The HIPAA privacy regulations and security regulations impose and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards. \n\nThere are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. We also remain subject to federal or state privacy-related laws that may be more restrictive or contain different requirements than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to alleged privacy and data security violations. Further, certain states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities. These new laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect January 1, 2020 and was amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, passed on November 3, 2020, and effective as of January 1, 2023; the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, effective as of January 1, 2023; the Colorado Privacy Act and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, both effective as of July 1, 2023; and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, effective as of December 31, 2023. Among other things, these state-specific laws create new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provide new privacy rights to state residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Draft regulations implementing the CPRA and Colorado statute have been published, but many questions remain as to how all of the new statutes will be interpreted. The, the effects of state data protection laws are significant and have required us to modify our data processing practices, and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to ensure ongoing compliance, particularly given our base of operations in California. \n\nIn addition to the laws discussed above, we may see more stringent state and federal privacy legislation passed in 2023 and beyond, as the increased cyber-attacks during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have once again put a spotlight on data privacy and security in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We cannot predict where new legislation might arise, the scope of such legislation, or the potential impact to our business and operations. \n\nFCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare \n\nprofessionals in many countries, either directly or through our contracted distributors. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. \n\nPhysician Payment Sunshine Act. Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was signed into law in March 2010, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. As a manufacturer of U.S. FDA&#8209;regulated devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to this law, which requires us to track and annually report certain direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value we make to certain U.S.-licensed health care practitioners and U.S. teaching hospitals. We are also required to report certain ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In 2018, the law was amended to require tracking and reporting of payments and transfers of value provided to health care practitioners besides physicians, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. These expanded reporting requirements took effect in 2022 for payments and transfers of value made to these additional practitioner-types in 2021. CMS has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, depending on the circumstances, and reported payments also have the potential to draw scrutiny to our relationships with health care practitioners and academic medical institutions, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws. \n\nIn addition, certain states also have laws and regulations related to payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties. \n\nInternational Regulation \n\nInternational sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. \n\nThe regulatory framework governing medical devices is largely harmonized within the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe (please note that the UK is effectively no longer part of the European Union as of January 1, 2021). Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. To be placed on the European Union market, devices must undergo a conformity assessment and bear the CE mark, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable rules. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a &#8220;Notified Body.&#8221; This third-party assessment, which may consist of an audit of the manufacturer&#8217;s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer&#8217;s product, is always required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union, except in case of Class I medical devices (those entailing the lowest level of risk). Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. The European Union Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, went into force in 2017, replacing the existing Directive and providing three years for transition and compliance, which has been extended by one additional year. The MDR became applicable in the European Union on May 26, 2021, changing several aspects of the existing regulatory framework. Other countries have adopted medical device regulatory regimes, such as the Classification Rules for Medical Devices published by the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore regulation of medical devices under the Health Products Act, and Health Canada&#8217;s risk classification system for invasive devices, among others. Each country may have its own processes and requirements for medical device licensing, approval, and regulation, therefore requiring us to seek regulatory approvals on a country-by-country basis. \n\nOutside the United States a range of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well and some industry-specific laws and codes of conduct, apply to the medical device industry and interactions with government officials and entities and healthcare professionals. Laws include the UK Bribery Act of 2010. Further, the EU member countries have emphasized a greater focus on healthcare fraud and abuse and have indicated greater attention to the industry by the European Anti-Fraud Office. MedTech Europe, the medical device industry association, also \n\nintroduced the Code of Ethical Business Practices, which came into effect on January 1, 2017. Countries in Asia have also become more active in their enforcement of anti-bribery laws and with respect to procurement and supply chain fraud. \n\nIn the European Union, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, applies across the European Union and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company&#8217;s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the European Union to comply with EU privacy and data protection rules, even if the company itself does not have a physical presence in the European Union. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. Due to the strong consumer protection aspects of the GDPR, companies subject to its purview are allocating substantial legal costs to the development of necessary policies and procedures and overall compliance efforts. We expect continued costs associated with maintaining compliance with GDPR into the future. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment in Case C-311/18 that declared the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework invalid (Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Ltd and Maximillian Schrems, also knowns as &#8220;Schrems II&#8221;). In the absence of the new adequacy decision, this judgment still results in additional compliance obligations for companies that rely on mechanisms other than the Privacy Shield, like standard contractual clauses and appropriate supplementary measures to ensure a valid basis for the transfer of personal data outside of Europe. Though a new adequacy decision (EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework) may be put in place in the near future, it may also be subject to challenges similar to those faced by the Privacy Shield. In view of this and other developments, data transfer risk remains a potential issue that requires regular monitoring. We expect continued costs associated with maintaining compliance with the GDPR into the future, and these requirements, as interpreted by EU data protection authorities, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nEnvironmental Regulation \n\nOur research and development and clinical processes involve the handling of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous and biological materials and we incur expenses relating to compliance with these laws and regulations. If violations of environmental, health and safety laws occur, we could be held liable for damages, penalties and costs of remedial actions. These expenses or this liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition. We may violate environmental, health and safety laws in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business and environmental groups. Changes to or restrictions on permitting requirements or processes, hazardous or biological material storage or handling might require an unplanned capital investment or relocation. Failure to comply with new or existing laws or regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Advisory Boards and Consultants ##TABLE_END\n\nWe have relied upon the advice of experts in the development and commercialization of our products. Since 2005, we have used experts in various disciplines on a consulting basis as needed to solve problems or accelerate development pathways. We may continue to engage advisors from the academic, consultancy, governmental or other areas to assist us as necessary. Relationships between manufacturers and physicians, including in consultancy and advisory board roles, is subject to scrutiny under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and its state law equivalents. Due to this scrutiny, we incur legal and consulting fees to ensure our relationships with physicians and other health care providers meet regulatory requirements, including that compensation paid to such physicians is within fair market value. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nHuman Capital \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe aim to foster a diverse, inclusive and engaging culture that values each person&#8217;s unique skill set and to continue to attract &#8211; and retain &#8211; top talent throughout the organization. 2022 represented a year of growth across Dexcom; our employee population grew both by number and global footprint. With our shift from office to hybrid work, we have access to more &#8211; and more diverse &#8211; talent than ever before. As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately 7,600 employees around the globe, including 7,500 full-time employees. Approximately 60% of our full-time U.S. employees are ethnically diverse. \n\n##TABLE_START Country Female Male Grand Total Ethnically Diverse (US Only)* United States 2,300 2,900 5,200 3,300 Non-United States (&#8220;OUS&#8221;) 1,300 1,100 2,400 N/A Grand Total** 3,600 4,000 7,600 3,300 ##TABLE_END\n\n*All diversity data is self-reported. We capture ethnic diversity data in the United States only, comprised of the following categories: Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races. \n\n**Includes full time and part time employees. \n\nThe human capital measures and objectives that we focus on include diversity, equity and inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;); communications and engagement; health, safety and wellness; total rewards and pay equity; and talent growth and development. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\nOur journey to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace continues. As Dexcom continues to grow and scale, our DEI initiatives have been critical not only for company culture but also for the growing diversity of patients our products will benefit across the globe. \n\nWith expanded talent and diversity staff, we have evolved the DEI Leadership Council, or DLC, as a means for leaders to work closely together to advance the broader DEI strategy across the organization. We are proud to support our global and local employee resource groups, whose employee-led activities and initiatives we believe continue to foster a sense of belonging for our employees. In 2022, foundational DEI training was launched to all employees. We also offered opportunities for employees to take a deeper dive into specific topics related to DEI. 2022 also allowed us to build out our talent programs to foster equitable access and visibility to our up-and-coming diverse leaders within the company. We continue to weave DEI into talent conversations, particularly at senior levels, which we believe has contributed to our improved representation of female leaders at Dexcom. \n\nCommunications and Engagement \n\nThrough strategic communications, we have strengthened the connection between our leaders and our business goals, as well as the behaviors needed to drive our employee experience. We also believe by listening to our employees, we can create a dynamic workplace that will foster productivity while promoting work-life balance and connection across the organization. We have continued to seek out &#8220;the voice of the employee&#8221; through life cycle surveys. Each year, we offer an engagement survey titled &#8220;We&#8217;re Listening.&#8221; Employee engagement scores remain high based on index and remains consistent at approximately 80% since November 2021. What is notable is people are proud to work here and see a clear link between their work and the Dexcom mission. \n\nHealth, Safety and Wellness \n\nWe are deeply committed to the safety, health and wellness of our employees. The Dexcom Environmental, Health, Safety &#38; Sustainability team develops global safety practices and procedures, trains employees, and monitors compliance. Through these efforts, along with leadership commitment and investment of resources in support of workplace safety initiatives, our total US injury rate has consistently tracked below industry averages. \n\nWe also provide comprehensive well-being programs that support our employees and their families. For example, Inspire, our global wellness platform, helps employees and their family members develop and achieve their physical, emotional, and financial well-being goals. We offer our employees the choice of several health plans including the Level2 program, which is designed specifically to support individuals with type 2 diabetes, and provides participants a Dexcom CGM, an activity tracker, and ongoing coaching to encourage greater health outcomes. \n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2022, our goal to support our employees&#8217; needs remained constant. We continued to provide both COVID and flu vaccination clinics for employees and their families, proactive on-site testing for our employees who returned to the workplace, and continued support of remote work for employees whose roles allow for it. We also continue to evaluate how to maintain a hybrid workplace beyond the pandemic to ensure that we meet our employees&#8217; ever-changing needs outside the workplace. \n\nTotal Rewards and Pay Equity \n\nOur total rewards package includes market competitive pay, comprehensive and competitive global benefits and retirement offerings, paid time off and family leave, tuition reimbursement and on-site services. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, we offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and restricted stock units are provided to eligible employees under our broad-based stock incentive programs. \n\nIn 2022, we continued our proactive year-end global market adjustment process intended to ensure we maintain pay equity between active employees and potential new external hires. Through this process, employees who meet predefined criteria may be eligible for an additional adjustment in base salary if they have fallen below Dexcom&#8217;s determined minimum. We believe by continuing to ensure equitable pay between existing and new hires, we will be better positioned to retain valued employees. \n\nAdditionally, we continue to proactively review both gender and ethnicity pay equity for our global employees in the same or similar roles. The goal of these reviews is to identify and close any gaps in average pay, after accounting for legitimate business factors that may explain differences, such as performance, time in role, and tenure with the company. We have incorporated the findings into our compensation assessment cycles, and we recognize the need to regularly review pay equity to maintain our pay equity goals. With the implementation of our global market adjustment process, we will now conduct the gender and ethnicity review twice a year. \n\nTalent Growth and Development \n\nWe continue to invest in new learning systems and programming to support employee development. To support the personal and professional growth of our workforce, we have built an extensive library of development offerings to empower employees at all levels to advance their skill sets and knowledge base. Because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to career development, we continue to evolve our curriculum to meet the needs of our diverse workforce. At this time, our employees have completed over 32,000 hours dedicated to this learning. \n\nIn addition, each employee has unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning, which offers more than 13,000 courses designed to support career advancement. In 2022, more than one-third of our employees used LinkedIn Learning to assist in their professional development. We increased the utilization of this platform in 2022 by embedding videos and courses in learning initiatives, encouraging leader and peer recommendations, and using targeted marketing of this resource throughout the organization. This has resulted in our employees completing over 14,000 courses in 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START "

      "text": " ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nOur short and long-term success is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors that are difficult to predict or beyond our control. Before making a decision to invest in, hold or sell our common stock, stockholders and potential stockholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the other information we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider to be immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Refer to our disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Our Business and Operations ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Pricing and Reimbursement ##TABLE_END\n\nIf we experience decreasing prices for our products and we are unable to reduce our expenses, including the per unit cost of producing our products, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nWe have experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, decreasing prices for our products due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other third-party payors, increased market power of our payors, and increased competition among suppliers, including manufacturing services providers, as the medical device industry consolidates. If the prices for our products and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses, including the cost of sourcing materials, logistics and the cost to manufacture our products, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased costs for manufacturing and outsourced services while also causing additional pressure to reduce the prices for our products if a recession or depression occurs and people are unable to afford our products. We cannot predict the ultimate impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, economic conditions, or their effects could have on our business operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nWe are subject to cost-containment efforts by third-party payors that could result in reduced product pricing and/or sales of our products and cause a reduction in future revenue. \n\nIn the United States and other countries, government and private sector access to health care products continues to be a subject of focus, and efforts to reduce health care costs are being made by third-party payors. Most of our customers rely on third-party payors, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to cover the cost of our products. We expect that the continuing cost reduction and containment measures may reduce the cost or utilization of health care products and could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for coverage or payment from these third-party payors or to costs being shifted to patients for our products. Additionally, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and economic slowdown, some customers have lost access and others may lose access to their private health insurance plan if they lose their job, and an impact to job status may extend for a prolonged period of time, beyond possible coverage periods through COBRA, or where the cost to maintain coverage may not be affordable to our customer. As most of our customers rely on third-party payors, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to cover the cost of our products, our customers may lose coverage or reimbursement for our products, which may harm our business and results of operations. \n\nWe have experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, downward pressure on product pricing. To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to our products, our future revenue may be reduced and our business may be harmed. \n\nAlthough many third-party payors have adopted some form of coverage policy for continuous glucose monitoring devices, our products do not always have such coverage, including simple broad-based contractual coverage, with third-party payors and we frequently experience administrative challenges in obtaining coverage or reimbursement for our products. If we are unable to obtain adequately broad coverage or reimbursement for our products or any future products from third-party payors, our revenue may be negatively impacted. \n\nAs a medical device company, reimbursement from government and/or commercial third-party healthcare payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, is an important element of our success. The Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, provides coverage for &#8220;Therapeutic Continuous Glucose Monitors&#8221; as durable medical equipment eligible for coverage under Medicare Part B. Coverage criteria for therapeutic CGMs is determined by CMS under national coverage determinations as well as by local Medicare Administrative Contractors under local coverage determinations. Therefore, Medicare reimbursement for our CGM devices is subject to various coverage conditions and often requires a patient-specific coverage analysis. Medicare does not cover any items or services that are not &#8220;reasonable and necessary.&#8221; Medicare covers the CGM system, which includes supplies necessary for the use of the device, under the Durable Medical Equipment, or DME, benefit category. In order to be covered under this benefit, one component of the CGM system must meet the criteria for a durable medical device. To date, the receiver satisfied this criteria. To the extent that a receiver is not used by a Medicare beneficiary or CMS otherwise determines that the items and supplies ordered are not medically necessary, Medicare may not cover that CGM system or any associated supplies . \n\nA number of regulatory and commercial hurdles remain relating to wide-scale sales where a government or commercial third-party payor provides reimbursement, including sales to Medicare beneficiaries. If we are unable to successfully address these hurdles, reimbursement of our products may be limited to a smaller subset of people with diabetes covered by Medicare or to those people with diabetes covered by other third-party payors that have adopted policies for CGM devices allowing for coverage of these devices if certain conditions are met. Adverse coverage or reimbursement decisions relating to our products, or rescission or limitation of favorable determinations, by CMS, its Medicare Administrative Contractors, other state, federal or international payors, and/or third-party commercial payors could significantly reduce reimbursement, which could have an impact on the acceptance of, and demand for, our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the eight largest private third-party payors, in terms of the number of covered lives, have issued coverage policies for the category of CGM devices. In addition, we have negotiated contracted rates with all of those third-party payors for the purchase of our current CGM systems by their members. Nevertheless, coverage and reimbursement-related barriers remain. Among other things, people with diabetes without insurance that covers our products bear the financial cost of them. In addition, in the United States, people with diabetes using existing single-point finger stick devices are generally reimbursed all or part of the product cost by Medicare or other third-party payors, which may be perceived as more advantageous for consumers. Further, while many third-party payors have adopted some form of coverage policy on CGM devices, in a sizeable percentage of cases, under durable medical equipment benefits, those coverage policies frequently are restrictive and require significant medical documentation and other requirements in order for policy holders to obtain reimbursement, and as a result, we have difficulty improving the efficiency of our customer service group. Moreover, it is not uncommon for governmental, including federal and/or state, agencies and their contractors to conduct periodic routine billing and compliance reviews that may entail extensive documentation requests, cooperation with which may require significant time and resources, and may result in identification of overpayments that may need to be refunded. The commercial success of our products in both domestic and international markets will substantially depend on whether timely and comprehensive third-party reimbursement is widely available for individuals that use them. \n\nCMS has proposed new draft coverage guidelines for CGMs, which if implemented, would have a favorable impact on us. Currently, Medicare coverage for CGM is only available to Medicare patients who take at least three doses of insulin a day, limiting CGM reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries with intensive Type 1 and 2 diabetes. The draft Local Coverage Determination (LCD), if finalized, would extend Medicare CGM coverage to patients who use insulin at least once per day. Further, the LCD would also allow coverage for patients not taking insulin if the patient has a history of problematic hypoglycemia. We expect CMS to release the final coverage decision this year. \n\nNevertheless, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new and existing medical devices, and, as a result, they may be restrictive, or they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. In order to obtain additional reimbursement arrangements, including under pharmacy benefits, we may have to agree to a net sales price lower than the net sales price we might charge in other sales channels. Our revenue may be limited by the continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various increasingly sophisticated means, such as leveraging increased competition, increasing eligibility requirements such as second opinions and other documentation, purchasing in a bundle, or redesigning benefits. In December 2021, CMS published a final rule expanding the classification of DME under Medicare Parts B &#38; C to include adjunctive CGMs (i.e., CGMs that do not replace standard blood glucose monitors for treatment decisions) and related supplies. This final rule expands coverage of CGMs to include a large competitor&#8217;s competing device, which may negatively impact our sales. We are unable to predict what effect the current or any future healthcare reform will \n\nhave on our business, or the effect these matters will have on our customers. Our dependence on the commercial success of our current CGM systems makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts. Accordingly, unless government and other third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our current CGM systems, people without coverage who have diabetes may not use our products. Furthermore, payors are increasingly basing reimbursement rates on factors such as prior approvals and the effectiveness of the product, clinical outcomes associated with the product, and any factors that negatively impact the effectiveness or clinical outcomes (or cause a perception of any such negative impact), such as the results of a clinical trial, a product defect, or a product recall, which could negatively impact the reimbursement rate. Also, the trends toward managed healthcare in the United States and legislative efforts intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and may result in lower prices for our products or the exclusion of our products from reimbursement programs. \n\nIn some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of medical devices are subject to government control. We are susceptible to changes in government-mandated coverage requirements and other controls which could impact access to and affordability of our products. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Product Development ##TABLE_END\n\nThe research and development efforts we undertake independently, and in some instances in connection with our collaborations with third parties, may not result in the development of commercially viable products, the generation of significant future revenues or adequate profitability. \n\nIn order to address the anticipated needs of our customers, pursue new markets for our existing products, and remain competitive, we focus our research and development efforts and strategic third-party collaboration activities on the enhancement of our current CGM products, the development of next-generation products and the development of novel technologies and services. \n\nThe development of new products, or novel technologies and services and the enhancement of our current CGM products (including seeking and potentially obtaining new indications for use), requires significant investment in research and development, intellectual property protection, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and third party reimbursement. The results of our product development and commercialization efforts may be affected by a range of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products (whether independently or with our partners), determine a feasible or timely regulatory pathway or approach, and launch those products cost effectively into multiple markets and geographies. If we are unable to successfully anticipate customer needs, innovate, develop new products and successfully launch them, we may not be able to generate significant future revenues or profits from these efforts. Failing to timely launch our products may cause them to become obsolete and materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. \n\nThe development and commercial launch timelines for our products depend a great deal on our ability to achieve clinical endpoints and satisfy regulatory requirements and to overcome technology challenges, and may be delayed due to scheduling issues with patients and investigators, requests from institutional review boards, or inquiries from regulators about our independent and collaborative product development activities, product performance and manufacturing supply constraints, among other factors. In addition, support of these clinical trials requires significant resources from employees involved in the production of our products, including research and development, manufacturing, quality assurance, and clinical and regulatory personnel. Even if our development and clinical trial efforts appear successful to us and our regulatory submission appears satisfactory to us, the FDA may disagree and may decide not to grant marketing authorization for the products or may require additional product testing or clinical trials or other data to be developed and submitted before approving the products, which would result in product launch delays and additional expense. Even if a product receives marketing authorization from the FDA, it may not be accepted in the marketplace by physicians and people with diabetes. \n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to expand into new markets, including with insulin device manufacturers such as Eli Lilly, Insulet, Novo Nordisk, Tandem Diabetes and The Ypsomed Group to integrate our CGM technology into their insulin delivery systems. We have also entered into collaborations with several organizations that are currently using, or are developing, programs for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes that utilize our current CGM systems. As a result of these relationships, our operating results depend, to some extent, on the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize their insulin delivery systems or monitoring products. Any factors that may limit our partners&#8217; ability to achieve widespread adoption of their systems, including competitive pressures, technological breakthroughs for the treatment or prevention of diabetes, adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to insulin pump products, or changes in \n\nreimbursement rates or policies of third-party payors relating to insulin pumps or similar products, could have an adverse impact on our operating results. \n\nMany of the companies that we collaborate with are also competitors or potential competitors who may decide to terminate our collaborative arrangement. In the event of such a termination, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization, we may need to cancel some development programs and we may face increased competition. Additionally, collaborations may not result in the development of products that achieve commercial success and could be terminated prior to developing any products. Former collaborators may use the experience and insights they develop in the course of their collaborations with us to initiate or accelerate their development of products that compete with our products, which may create competitive disadvantages for us. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that any of our collaborations will result in the successful development of a commercially viable product or result in significant additional future revenues. \n\nOur products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance. \n\nWe expect that sales of our current CGM systems will account for substantially all of our product revenue for the foreseeable future. If and when we receive FDA or other regulators&#8217; marketing authorization for, and begin commercialization of, our next-generation CGM systems, we expect most patients will migrate onto those systems. In the periods leading up to the launch of new or upgraded versions of our CGM systems, however, our customers&#8217; anticipation of the release of those products may cause them to cancel, change or delay current period purchases of our current products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nNotwithstanding our prior experience in marketing and selling our products, we might be unable to successfully expand the commercialization of our existing products or begin commercialization of our next-generation CGM systems on a wide-scale for a number of reasons, including the following: \n\n&#8226; our G6 and G7 systems prompt the user to replace the sensor no later than the tenth day, which might make it expensive for users; \n\n&#8226; widespread market acceptance of our products by physicians and people with diabetes will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate their relative safety, effectiveness, reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of use; \n\n&#8226; the limited size of our sales force; \n\n&#8226; we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately expand the commercialization efforts for our products; \n\n&#8226; expanded coverage opportunities for our competitors&#8217; CGM devices and supplies, including coverage for adjunctive CGMs, increasing competition in the marketplace; \n\n&#8226; our FDA and other regulatory authority marketing application submissions and reviews may be delayed, or cleared or approved with limited product indications and labeling; \n\n&#8226; we may not be able to manufacture our products in commercial quantities commensurate with demand or at an acceptable cost; \n\n&#8226; for people with Type 2 diabetes, current reimbursement from third-party payors is generally limited to people on intensive insulin therapy; \n\n&#8226; the uncertainties associated with establishing and qualifying new manufacturing facilities; \n\n&#8226; people with diabetes may need to incur the costs of single-point finger stick devices, in addition to our systems; \n\n&#8226; the relative immaturity of the CGM market internationally, and limited international reimbursement of CGM systems by third-party payors and government healthcare providers outside the United States; \n\n&#8226; the introduction and market acceptance of competing products and technologies, which may have a lower cost or price, allow for a convenience improvement and/or allow for improved accuracy and reliability; \n\n&#8226; greater name or brand recognition and more established medical product distribution channels by some of our competitors; \n\n&#8226; our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of supplies timely and at appropriate quality levels from our single- or sole-source and other key suppliers; \n\n&#8226; our inability to manufacture products that perform in accordance with expectations of consumers; and \n\n&#8226; rapid technological change may make our technology and our products obsolete. \n\nIn addition to the risks outlined above, our G6 and G7 systems are more invasive than many other self-monitored glucose testing systems, including single-point finger stick devices, and people with diabetes may be unwilling to insert a sensor in their body, especially if their current diabetes management involves no more than two finger sticks per day. Moreover, people with diabetes may not perceive the benefits of CGM and may be unwilling to change their current treatment regimens. Physicians may not recommend or prescribe our products unless and until (i) there is more long-term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods, (ii) there are additional recommendations from prominent physicians that our products are effective in monitoring glucose levels, and (iii) reimbursement or insurance coverage is more widely available. In addition, market acceptance of our products by physicians and people with diabetes in Europe or other countries will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate their relative safety, effectiveness, reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of use. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to generate product revenue from our sales efforts in Europe or other countries. We cannot predict when, if ever, healthcare professionals, including physicians, and people with diabetes may adopt more widespread use of CGM systems, including our systems. If our CGM systems do not achieve and maintain an adequate level of acceptance by people with diabetes, healthcare professionals, including physicians, and third party payors, our future revenue may be reduced and our business may be harmed. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Manufacturing, Commercial Operations and Commercialization ##TABLE_END\n\nIf our manufacturing capabilities are insufficient to produce an adequate supply of product at appropriate quality levels, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed. \n\nOur existing manufacturing facilities are designed to manufacture current and next-generation sensors and transmitters, but may not be scaled quickly enough to permit us to manufacture one or more of our CGM systems in quantities sufficient to meet market demand. In the past, we have had difficulty scaling our manufacturing operations to provide a sufficient supply of product to support market demand and our commercialization efforts. From time to time, we have also experienced brief periods of backorder and, at times, have had to limit the efforts of our sales force to introduce our products to new customers. We have focused significant effort on continual improvement programs in our manufacturing operations intended to improve quality, yields and throughput. We have made progress in manufacturing to enable us to supply adequate amounts of product to support our commercialization efforts; however, we cannot guarantee that supply will not be constrained in the future. We may not adequately predict the market demand for our products, in order to produce our products in the quantities we anticipate will be necessary to meet market demand. We will need to adequately predict the market demand for our products and increase our manufacturing capacity by a significant factor over the current level to meet or exceed the anticipated market demand. In addition, we will have to modify our manufacturing design, reliability and process if and when our next-generation CGM technologies are approved, cleared or otherwise authorized by the applicable regulatory body and commercialized. \n\nThere are technical challenges to increasing manufacturing capacity, including equipment design, automation, validation and installation, contractor issues and delays, licensing and permitting delays or rejections, materials procurement, manufacturing site expansion, problems with production yields and quality control and assurance. Continuing to develop commercial-scale manufacturing facilities will require the investment of substantial additional funds and the hiring and retention of additional management, quality assurance, quality control and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. Delays in the launch of next-generation products may result in unanticipated continuing increases in demand for current-generation products (to substitute for the unavailability of the next-generation products) which, if not adequately prepared for, may result in deficits in our ability to produce adequate amounts of the prior-generation products to meet demand at appropriate prices. \n\nThe scaling of manufacturing capacity is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and may lead to variability in product quality or reliability, increased construction timelines, as well as resources required to design, install and maintain manufacturing equipment, among others, all of which can lead to unexpected delays in manufacturing output. In addition, any changes to our manufacturing processes may trigger the need for submissions or notifications to, and in some cases advance approval from, the FDA or other regulatory authorities because of the potential impact of changes on our previously cleared, approved and/or authorized devices. Our facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA and corresponding state agencies on an ongoing basis, and we must comply with Good Manufacturing Practices and the FDA Quality System Regulation, as well as certain state requirements. We may be unable to adequately maintain, develop and expand our manufacturing process and operations or maintain compliance with FDA and state agency requirements, and manufacturing issues could impact our cleared and approved products. If we are unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of our current products or any future products for which we may receive approval or clearance, maintain control over expenses or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth, or if we underestimate growth, we may not have the capability to satisfy market demand, contractual obligations, and our business will suffer. \n\nManufacturing difficulties and/or any disruption at our facilities may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales, and increase our expenses. \n\nOur products are manufactured at certain facilities, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs at one of our facilities that results in damage to, restrictions on the use of, or closure of, one or more of such facilities, or if our distributions from those facilities are limited or restricted in any way, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at the previous levels or at all. Because of the time required to approve and lease a manufacturing facility, an alternate facility and/or a third-party may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost. \n\nAdditionally, the majority of our operations are conducted at facilities located in San Diego, California, Mesa, Arizona and, beginning in 2023, Penang Malaysia. We take precautions to safeguard our facilities, which include manufacturing protocols, insurance, health and safety protocols, and off-site storage of data. However, a natural or man-made disaster, such as fire, flood, earthquake, act of terrorism, cyber-attack or other disruptive event, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or another public health emergency, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage, destroy or limit our manufacturing equipment, inventory, or records and cause us to incur additional expenses. Earthquakes are of particular significance since our manufacturing facilities in California are located in an earthquake-prone area. Wildfires are also increasingly more common in southern California and present risk to our manufacturing operations. Our Arizona facility may confront water supply issues resulting from the ongoing drought in the Western United States and our Malaysia facility may confront issues related to its construction on a reclaimed wetland and the political stability of the Malaysia government. In the event our existing manufacturing facilities or equipment are affected by man-made or natural disasters, we may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased, it would seriously harm our business. The insurance we maintain against fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters and similar events may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case. Further, insurance coverage may not be available or successfully secured for loss of profits or business interruption relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts. \n\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers and outsource to other parties, making us vulnerable to supply disruptions, suboptimal quality, non-compliance and/or price fluctuations, which could harm our business. \n\nWe manufacture the majority of our products and procure important third-party services, such as sterilization services, at numerous facilities worldwide. We purchase many of the components, materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such materials, components and services. However, we also rely on single and/or sole sources for certain components and materials used in manufacturing, such as for the application-specific integrated circuit that is incorporated into the transmitter and certain polymers used to synthesize the polymeric biointerface membranes for our products. In some cases, our agreements with these and other suppliers can be terminated by either party upon short notice. Our contract manufacturers may also rely on single- or sole-source suppliers to manufacture some of the components used in our products. \n\nAlthough we work with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining quality, timeliness and reliability, the supply of these components, materials and services has in some cases been, and may continue to be impacted, interrupted or insufficient. Our manufacturers and suppliers may also encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons. They may fail to follow specific protocols and procedures, fail to comply with applicable regulations, or be the subject of FDA or other regulatory authority audits or inspections that result in allegations of non-compliance (for example, resulting in Form 483 Observations, Warning Letters, or other FDA enforcement actions). Our manufacturers and suppliers may also experience or be impacted by equipment malfunction, environmental factors, and public health emergencies including but not limited to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. \n\nFurther, if our sole- or single-source suppliers shift their manufacturing and assembly sites to other locations, depending on the circumstances and nature of the item supplied, in addition to quality system activities such as verification and validation, there could be a need for FDA notifications or submissions, and the new locations could be subject to regulatory inspections. If there are regulatory delays or impediments impacting our suppliers or us for any reason, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers, particularly for our single-source components, in part because of the custom nature of various parts we design. Any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive products. For supply risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic see our Risk Factor entitled, &#8220;The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants and the COVID-19 disease that it \n\ncauses, or similar public health crises, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our manufacturing, commercial operations and sales.&#8221; \n\nOur reliance on these outside manufacturers and suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including: \n\n&#8226; we may experience a reduction or interruption in supply, and may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms from additional or replacement sources; \n\n&#8226; our products are technologically complex and it is difficult to develop alternative supply sources; \n\n&#8226; we are not a major customer of many of our suppliers, and these suppliers may therefore give other customers&#8217; needs higher priority than ours; \n\n&#8226; our suppliers may make errors in manufacturing components that could negatively affect the quality, effectiveness or safety of our products or cause delays in shipment of our products; \n\n&#8226; we may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our single-source supplies; \n\n&#8226; switching components may require product redesign and submission to the FDA of new applications (such as new 510(k) submissions or PMA supplements) which could significantly delay production; \n\n&#8226; our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers, and fluctuations in demand for the products these suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver components to us in a timely manner or at the current pricing; \n\n&#8226; our suppliers may discontinue the production of components that are critical to our products; and \n\n&#8226; our suppliers may encounter financial and/or other hardships unrelated to our demand for components, including those related to changes in global economic conditions and/or disease outbreaks, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements. \n\nWe also outsource certain services to other parties, including inside sales, certain transaction processing, accounting, information technology, manufacturing, and other areas. Outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables and potentially result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, erroneous data, supply disruptions, non-compliance (including with applicable legal or regulatory requirements and industry standards) and/or reputational harm, with potential negative effects on our results. Closure of non-essential businesses and shelter-in-place orders occurring in the U.S. and globally as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely impact our outsourced operations. We continue to monitor this situation closely. \n\nWe also require the suppliers, service providers and business partners of components or services for our products and related services to comply with law and certain of our policies regarding sourcing practices, but we do not control them or their practices. If any supplier, service provider or business partner violates laws or implements unethical practices, there could be disruptions to our supply chain, cancellation of our orders, a termination of the relationship with the partner or damage to our reputation, and the FDA or other regulators could seek to hold us responsible for such violations. \n\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into and maintain arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our products, we may have difficulty achieving market awareness and selling our products in the future. \n\nWe must continue to develop and grow our sales and marketing organization and enter into partnerships or other arrangements to market and sell our products and/or collaborate with third parties, including distributors and others, to market and sell our products to maintain the commercial success of our current systems and to achieve commercial success for any of our future products. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, our future revenue may be reduced and our business may be harmed. \n\nDeveloping and managing a direct sales organization is a difficult, expensive and time-consuming process. Although we have enabled our sales and marketing activity to be conducted virtually and remotely, restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak may have a substantial impact on our customers and sales cycles and have impacted and/or interrupted our sales and marketing activity. \n\nTo continue to develop our sales and marketing organization to successfully achieve market awareness and sell our products, we must: \n\n&#8226; recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective and experienced sales and marketing personnel; \n\n&#8226; effectively train our sales and marketing personnel in the benefits and risks of our products; \n\n&#8226; establish and maintain successful sales, marketing, training and education programs that educate health care professionals, including endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators, so they can appropriately inform their patients about our products; \n\n&#8226; manage geographically dispersed sales and marketing operations; and \n\n&#8226; effectively train our sales and marketing personnel on the applicable advertising and promotion, and fraud and abuse laws that govern interactions with healthcare professionals and institutions as well as current and prospective patients and maintain active oversight and auditing measures to ensure continued compliance. \n\nWe currently employ sales and marketing personnel for the direct sale and marketing of our products in North America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Our direct sales and marketing team calls on healthcare providers and people with diabetes throughout the applicable country, to the extent permissible, to raise awareness and initiate sales of our products. Our sales and marketing organization competes with the experienced, larger and well-funded marketing and sales operations of our competitors. We may not be able to successfully manage our dispersed sales force or increase our product sales at acceptable rates. COVID-19 restrictions vary by location across the United States and other regions of the world, which may continue to limit or prohibit our sales force from having in-person interactions with healthcare professionals and people with diabetes, which may result in decreased sales of our products. \n\nWe have also entered into distribution arrangements to leverage existing distributors (including wholesalers) already engaged in the distribution of drugs, devices and/or products in the diabetes marketplace. Some of our U.S distributors are focused on accessing underrepresented regions and or third-party payors that contract exclusively with distributors in the United States, while some of our international distributors call directly on healthcare providers and patients to market and sell our products. Because of the competition for their services, we may be unable to partner with or retain additional qualified distributors. Further, we may not be able to enter into agreements with distributors on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our distributors might not have the resources to continue to support our recent rapid growth. \n\nOur distribution agreements with AdaptHealth, AmerisourceBergen, Byram and affiliates, Cardinal Health and affiliates (including Edgepark Medical Supplies), and McKesson, our most significant wholesalers and distributors, each generated 10% or more of our total revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. We cannot guarantee that these relationships will continue or that we will be able to maintain this volume of sales from these relationships in the future. A substantial decrease or loss of these sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and operating performance. \n\nWe have entered into arrangements with pharmacy organizations in various countries to dispense our products directly to patients. Because of the competition for their services, we may be unable to enter into new partnerships or otherwise expand our pharmacy network on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our existing pharmacy relationships will continue, or that we will be able to maintain or increase sales volume from these relationships in the future. \n\nTo the extent that we enter into additional arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing, distribution and billing services, our product margins could be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, any revenue received will depend on the skills and efforts of others, and we cannot predict whether these efforts will be successful. \n\nIf we do not adequately predict market demand or otherwise optimize and operate our distribution channel successfully, it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity, increased costs, immediate shortages in product or component supply, or harm our business in other ways. \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from large, well-established companies with significant resources, and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively. \n\nThe market for glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants, including enhanced software capabilities, and related data and IT platforms. Our products are based on our proprietary technology, but a number of companies and medical researchers are pursuing new technologies for the monitoring of glucose levels. FDA or other regulatory approval of a commercially viable continuous glucose monitor or sensor produced by one of our competitors could significantly reduce market acceptance of our systems. In addition, certain development efforts throughout the diabetes industry, including that of the National Institutes of Health and other supporters of diabetes research are continually seeking ways to prevent, cure or improve treatment of diabetes. Therefore, our \n\nproducts may be rendered obsolete by technological breakthroughs in diabetes monitoring, treatment, prevention or cure. \n\nIn selling our current CGM systems, we compete directly with the Diabetes Care division of Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic plc&#8217;s Diabetes Group; Roche Diabetes Care, a division of Roche Diagnostics; privately-held LifeScan, Inc.; and Ascensia Diabetes Care, each of which manufactures and markets products for the single-point finger stick device market. Collectively, these companies currently account for the majority of the worldwide sales of self-monitored glucose testing systems. \n\nOur competitors manufacturing adjunctive CGMs have also recognized expanded Medicare coverage of their CGM devices and supplies following CMS&#8217; December 2021 final rule expanding the classification of DME under Medicare Parts B &#38; C to include adjunctive CGMs. These devices now directly compete with our CGM products in the Medicare market. \n\nSeveral companies are developing and/or commercializing products for continuous or periodic monitoring of glucose levels in the interstitial fluid under the skin that compete directly with our products. We have competed with Abbott for several years and their Libre family of CGM products. Medtronic markets and sells a standalone glucose monitoring product called Guardian Connect both internationally and in the United States. \n\nMedtronic and other third parties have developed or are developing insulin pumps integrated with CGM systems that provide, among other things, the ability to suspend insulin administration while the user&#8217;s glucose levels are low and to automate basal and bolus insulin dosing. \n\nWe also have begun to become aware of companies outside the traditional medical device sector that are attempting to develop competitive products and services, including for general health and wellness, or population health. \n\nSome of the companies developing or marketing competing devices are large and well-known publicly traded companies, and these companies may possess competitive advantages over us, including: \n\n&#8226; greater name recognition; \n\n&#8226; established relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors; \n\n&#8226; established distribution networks; \n\n&#8226; additional lines of products, and the ability to bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; \n\n&#8226; greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing approved products; \n\n&#8226; duration of sensor life; \n\n&#8226; the ability to integrate multiple products to provide additional features beyond CGM systems; and \n\n&#8226; greater financial and human resources for product development, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and patent litigation. \n\nAs a result, we may not be able to compete effectively against these companies or their products, which may adversely impact our business. \n\nThe outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants and the COVID-19 disease that it causes, or similar public health crises, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our manufacturing, commercial operations and sales. \n\nThe outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants and the COVID-19 disease that it causes has been and continues to be a global pandemic. The novel coronavirus, as well as new variants of the coronavirus have spread to most regions of the world, including the United States and Europe. The extent to which this coronavirus impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new variants of the virus and new information that may emerge concerning the virus and the actions to contain it or to mitigate the COVID-19 impact, among others. It is especially difficult to predict the impact on the global economic markets, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments, businesses, and other enterprises in response to the pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of those actions, and vaccine availability, distribution, efficacy and adoption. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have become more prevalent in the locations where we, our customers, suppliers or third-party business partners conduct business and as a result, we have, and may continue to experience more pronounced disruptions in our operations. \n\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, may have a material economic effect on our business. For example, such restrictions may have a substantial impact on our customers and sales cycles. They have impacted our sales and marketing activity including quite significantly in Europe where more restrictive health protection measures and greater reliance on in-person sales efforts at doctors&#8217; offices create a greater impediment to our selling efforts. Furthermore, changes in hospital or physician policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital or medical resources toward pandemic efforts may negatively affect the demand for our devices. The COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, put pressure on global economic conditions and overall spending for medical device products, and may cause our customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions. Further, if the spread of the coronavirus pandemic continues and our operations are adversely impacted, we risk a delay, default and/or nonperformance under existing agreements. \n\nSevere respiratory symptoms, infections and deaths related to the pandemic may disrupt healthcare delivery in the United States as well as the operations of regulatory bodies with responsibility for oversight of healthcare and health and medical products. Such disruptions could result in the focus and prioritization of regulatory resources on emergent matters, which could divert regulatory resources away from more routine regulatory matters that are not COVID-19 related but that have the potential to impact our business. For example, there have been and could continue to be delays in FDA review of applications for marketing authorization, including those which may be necessary for or in connection with proposed changes to our products or the changes to the processes by which they are manufactured. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect our ongoing device design, development, and commercialization plans. \n\nFurthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated shelter-in-place orders have and may continue to limit or restrict our ability to initiate, conduct or continue our clinical trials. Delays and disruptions in our clinical trials have and may continue to result in delays for new or expanded marketing authorizations for our products, which could materially affect our development and commercialization plans for our products. For example, we have experienced some delays in certain pivotal clinical trials for our next-generation CGM product. \n\nAdditionally, as a result of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent economic slowdown, some customers have lost, and others may lose, access to their private health insurance plan if they have lost or lose their job. Any prolonged economic downturn or recession could result in layoffs of employees and a significant increase in unemployment in the United States and elsewhere, which may continue even after the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is contained. An impact to job status may extend for a prolonged period of time, beyond possible coverage periods through COBRA, or where the cost to maintain coverage may not be affordable to our customer. As most of our customers rely on third-party payors, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to cover the cost of our products, our customers may lose coverage to our products, which may harm our business and results of operations. \n\nWe currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture components and materials for our devices, and to provide services such as sterilization services and we purchase these materials and services from numerous suppliers worldwide. The global COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to have an adverse impact on our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Disruptions relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could prevent employees, suppliers, distributors, and others from accessing manufacturing facilities and from transporting our products or the components required to manufacture our products. For example, we have experienced some supply chain disruption due to the global restrictions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the manufacture of our next-generation CGM product. Further, worldwide supply chain disruption relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in product shortages, that has and may continue to impact our ability to manufacture our devices. If either we or any third-party parties in the supply chain for materials used in the production of our devices continue to be adversely impacted by, and/or the restrictions resulting from, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our supply chain may be continue disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture our devices. These disruptions may, among other things, impact our ability to produce and supply products in quantities necessary to meet market demand. \n\nReduction in our manufacturing and shipping capabilities may have a material economic effect on our business and the results of our operations. If either we or any third-parties in the supply chain for components, materials or services used in the production of our devices are adversely impacted by the disruptions caused by, or restrictions resulting from, the COVID-19 pandemic, our supply chain may be disrupted, which may impact and/or limit our ability to manufacture and distribute our devices. \n\nWe continue to take precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees, including monitoring community levels of COVID-19 and masking according to the Center for Disease Control&#8217;s recommendations. \n\nWe continue to address other unique situations that arise among our workforce due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on a case-by-case basis. While we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to ensure the health and well-being of our employees, there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may not otherwise be exposed to COVID-19 outside of our workplace. If a number of our essential employees become ill, incapacitated or are otherwise unable to continue working during the current or any future epidemic, our operations may be adversely impacted. \n\nWhile the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets. The trading prices for our common stock and other medical device companies have been highly volatile as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. \n\nThe ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We have experienced certain delays or impacts to our business, our clinical trials, our research programs, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic so far, but do not yet know the full extent of future delays or impacts. However, these effects could have a material impact on our business, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to our International Operations ##TABLE_END\n\nWe are subject to a variety of risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect our business, our operations or profitability and operating results. \n\nOur operations in countries outside the United States, which accounted for approximately 26% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. In addition to our offices in countries such as, Australia, Canada, Germany, Lithuania, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom, we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the United States, especially in Asia and Europe. Additionally, we may increase our use of administrative and support functions from locations outside the United States. These business activities could expose us to greater risks associated with our sales and operations. \n\nAs we pursue opportunities outside the United States, we may become more exposed to these risks and our ability to scale our operations effectively may be affected. For example, we are building out a manufacturing facility in Malaysia. \n\nOur international expansion efforts, including our proposed manufacturing facility in Malaysia, may not be successful and we may experience difficulties in scaling these functions from locations outside the United States and may not experience the expected cost efficiencies. \n\nOur profitability and international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: \n\n&#8226; local product preferences and product requirements; \n\n&#8226; longer-term receivables than are typical in the United States; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; \n\n&#8226; less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the United States than exists in the United States; \n\n&#8226; trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements; \n\n&#8226; workforce instability; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in trade policy and tariff regulations; and \n\n&#8226; political and economic instability. \n\nMoreover, the tax laws in which we and our subsidiaries do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We have a significant presence in the European Union, as well as significant sales in the European Union, such that any changes in tax laws in the European Union will impact our business. The overall impact of such legislation in European Union member states is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by any laws impacting our tax rate. \n\nWhile it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented, or how they will ultimately impact us, they may materially impact our results of operations if, for example, our profits earned abroad are subject to U.S. income tax, or we are otherwise disallowed deductions as a result of these profits. \n\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes. \n\nFollowing a 2016 referendum of voters in the United Kingdom, or the U.K, to exit from the European Union, or the E.U., the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, which began a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. In December 2020, the U.K. and E.U. agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that was ratified by the parties in May 2021. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of the trade and cooperation agreement or otherwise, could prevent us from marketing our CGM systems in the U.K. and/or the E.U. and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. Under the trade and cooperation agreement, U.K. service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the entire E.U. single market, U.K. goods no longer benefit from the free movement of goods and there is no longer the free movement of people between the U.K. and the E.U. Depending on the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement, we could face new regulatory costs and challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. \n\nLaws and regulations governing the export of our products could adversely impact our business. \n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce, administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, and transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Due to our international operations, we are subject to such laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations. \n\nViolations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, we have only limited experience dealing with these laws and regulations and we cannot guarantee that our procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage. Any such violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants and the COVID-19 disease that it causes have also led to healthcare equipment shortages in the U.S. and around the world. For example, in 2020, certain U.S. federal government orders temporarily limited companies from exporting certain equipment (such as ventilators) to other countries. Though no such orders have been issued with respect to CGMs, if supply chain disruption causes significant shortages in CGMs or other equipment, it is possible that we could face additional barriers to exporting our devices outside of the United States. \n\nThe failure to comply with U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions. \n\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials and, in some instances, other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such anti-bribery laws. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our direct oversight and control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and discourage improper practices. However, our existing safeguards and any \n\nfuture improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. In addition, the government agencies may seek to hold us liable for successor liability for anti-corruption law violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nCurrent uncertainty in global economic and political conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from expectations. \n\nOur operations and performance depend on worldwide economic and political conditions. These conditions have been adversely impacted by continued global economic uncertainty, political instability and military hostilities in multiple geographies, including the current conflict in Ukraine, concerns over the potential downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt and continued sovereign debt, monetary and financial uncertainties in Europe and other foreign countries, and global health pandemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These include potential reductions in the overall stability and suitability of the Euro as a single currency, given the economic and political challenges facing individual Eurozone countries. These conditions have made and may continue to make it difficult for our customers and potential customers to afford our products, and could cause our customers to stop using our products or to use them less frequently. If that were to occur, our revenue may decrease and our performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, the pressure on consumers to absorb more of their own health care costs has resulted in some cases in higher deductibles and limits on durable medical equipment, which may cause seasonality in purchasing patterns. Furthermore, during economic uncertainty, our customers have had job losses and may continue to have issues gaining timely access to sufficient health insurance or credit, which could result in their unwillingness to purchase products or impair their ability to make timely payments to us. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. \n\nWe cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of the economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States, or in our industry. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nFailure to obtain any required regulatory authorization in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products abroad. \n\nWe conduct limited commercial and marketing efforts in Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and New Zealand with respect to our CGM systems and may seek to market our products in other regions in the future. Outside the United States, we can market a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and, in some cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The marketing authorization procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain any required authorization or approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA marketing authorization(s). Foreign regulatory authorization or approval processes may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA marketing authorization(s) in addition to other risks. We may not obtain foreign regulatory authorizations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Obtaining a marketing authorization from the FDA does not ensure authorization or approval by regulatory authorities in other countries will follow, and authorization or approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure authorization or approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. In addition, in order to obtain the authorization to market our products in certain foreign jurisdictions, in some cases we may need to obtain a Certificate to Foreign Government from the FDA. The FDA may refuse to issue a Certificate to Foreign Government if significant compliance-related concerns are identified. As a result, there are a range of factors that could preclude or impede our ability to file for regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations or to receive necessary approvals or authorizations to commercialize our products in any market outside the United States on a timely basis, or at all. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Privacy and Security ##TABLE_END\n\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and other requirements regarding privacy, data protection, security, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business \n\npractices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business. \n\nWe are subject to a number of foreign, federal and state laws and regulations protecting the use, disclosure, and confidentiality of certain patient health and personal information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information, including state breach notification laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HIPAA), the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the UK Data Protection Act and the UK GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), among others . As our customer base grows to include U.S. federal government agencies, Dexcom may also need comply with Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification requirements. These frameworks, in addition to similar laws being enacted by other states and counties, impose stringent cybersecurity standards and potentially significant non-compliance penalties, involve the expenditure of significant resources, the investment of significant resources and the investment of significant time and effort to comply. As these laws and regulations continue develop in the United States and internationally, we may be required to expend significant time and resources in order to update existing processes or implement additional mechanisms as necessary to ensure compliance with such cybersecurity laws. \n\nIn addition, foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. For example, data localization laws in some countries generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country. We may be subject to inquiries, investigations and audits in Europe and around the world, particularly in the areas of consumer and data protection, which will arise in the ordinary course of business and may increase in frequency as we continue to grow and expand our operations. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products less useful to our customers, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways. \n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, such as our proprietary business information and that of our clients, contractors, vendors and others as well as personally identifiable information of our customers, vendors and others, which data may include full names, social security numbers, addresses, and birth dates, in our data centers and on our networks. Our employees, contractor and vendors may also have access to and may use personal health information in the ordinary course of our business. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures and business controls, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, breaches due to employee, contractor or vendor error, or malfeasance or other disruptions or subject to the inadvertent or intentional unauthorized release of information. Any such occurrence could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our clients or damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our profitability, revenue and competitive position. \n\nAs we grow and expand our administrative, customer support or IT support services, we may also utilize the services of personnel and contractors located outside of the United States to perform certain functions. While we make every effort to review our applicable contracts and other payor requirements, a local, state, or federal government agency or one of our customers may find the use of offshore resources to be a violation of a legal or contractual requirement, which could result in termination of the contractual relationship, penalties, or changes in our business operations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, while we have implemented industry standard security measures for offshore access to protected health information and other personal information, unauthorized access or disclosure of such information by offshore personnel could result in legal claims or proceedings, and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our clients, damage to our reputation or result in the termination of contractual relationships, penalties or the loss of coverage, any of which could adversely affect our profitability, revenue and competitive position. \n\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions that compromise our information and expose us to liability could cause our business and reputation to suffer and could subject us to substantial liabilities. \n\nThe Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as &#8220;protected health information,&#8221; and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations \n\napply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Dexcom is a covered entity under HIPAA and may also function in a business associate capacity to other covered entities. \n\nCovered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay and notification must also be made to the U.S. Department of Health &#38; Human Services, Office for Civil Rights, or OCR and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. Various U.S. state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals and state agencies in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. \n\nViolations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal and civil penalties. The OCR enforces the regulations and performs compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. We follow and maintain a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, but there can be no assurance that OCR or other regulators will agree. The HIPAA privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards. \n\nThere are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. For example, from time-to-time, the OCR issues bulletins that outline its interpretations of HIPAA as applied to specific use cases. On December 1, 2022, OCR issued a bulletin on the requirements under HIPAA for online tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, pixels) to protect the privacy and security of health information. This bulletin outlined OCR&#8217;s position on the use of online tracking technology vendors, when certain information received by such vendors constitutes protected health information under HIPAA, and accordingly, when business associate agreements must be executed between covered entities, like Dexcom, and such vendors. Dexcom is assessing its responsibilities under the bulletin and determining its next steps in order to comply with OCR&#8217;s guidance in the bulletin. \n\nWe also remain subject to federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to alleged privacy and data security violations. California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect January 1, 2020, was amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, passed on November 3, 2020, which took effect January 1, 2023. The CCPA and CPRA, among other things, create data privacy obligations for covered companies and provide privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. In addition, other states have, or may, enact similar legislation. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. The effects of the CCPA and CPRA are significant and will likely require us to modify our data processing practices, and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply, particularly given our base of operations in California. There are also a number of other legislative proposals worldwide, including in the United States at both the federal and state level, that could impose additional and potentially conflicting obligations in areas affecting our business. \n\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign countries covering data privacy and other protection of health and employee information that may be more onerous than corresponding U.S. laws, including in particular the laws of Europe. \n\nFor instance, in the European Union, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, applies across the European Union and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company&#8217;s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the European Union to comply with EU privacy and data protection rules, even if the company itself does not have a physical presence in the European Union. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. Due to the strong consumer protection aspects of the GDPR, companies subject to its purview are allocating substantial legal costs to the development of necessary policies and procedures and overall compliance efforts. Data transfer risk remains a potential issue as certain Data Protection Authorities continue to raise concerns \n\nabout the transfer of data to the United States. Though a new framework may be put in place, it may be challenged as well. We expect continued costs associated with maintaining compliance with GDPR into the future, and these provisions as interpreted by EU agencies, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn addition to the laws discussed above, we may see more stringent state and federal privacy legislation in the future, as the increased cyber-attacks during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have once again put a spotlight on data privacy and security in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We cannot predict where new legislation might arise, the scope of such legislation, or the potential impact to our business and operations. \n\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could result in the compromise of confidential data or critical data systems and give rise to potential harm to customers, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business and operations. \n\nThere are numerous and evolving risks to our cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors. These cyber threat actors, whether internal of external to the Company, are becoming more frequent, sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access data, including third parties with whom the Company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber of phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive information on our network, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of individuals, such as our customers and employees. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented and deploy multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these incidents or techniques, timely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures. \n\nAdditionally, in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified our business practices and initially implemented telework policies for certain categories of &#8220;non-essential&#8221; employees to the extent possible. We have since adopted a hybrid workplace model for our employees. Our hybrid workplace allows us to work together globally to bring our life-changing products to as many people as possible. This means we have some employees who work primarily onsite, some who work primarily offsite, and others who flex in and out of the office based on the needs of the business and the individual. We recognized the need for flexibility in our physical workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also noted the potential benefits of a hybrid workplace to expand and retain our talent pool and reduce our real estate needs. The hybrid workplace does, however, introduce additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include, among other risks, increased phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to, or disruptions of, our information technology infrastructure and systems to support remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized access, use or dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction, alteration or misuse of valuable information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of individuals, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability. \n\nThese threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Over the past several years, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. These threat actors may be able to penetrate our security measures, breach our information technology systems, misappropriate or compromise confidential and proprietary information of our company and our customers, cause system disruptions and shutdowns, or introduce ransomware, malware, or vulnerabilities into our products, systems, and networks or those of our customers and partners. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our contractors, may be vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, malfeasance, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employees, consultants or other service providers. In addition, hardware, software or applications we \n\ndevelop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security or other problems that unexpectedly could interfere with the operation of our products. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff. \n\nWhile we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems. Our cybersecurity insurance includes coverage for a breach event covering expenses for notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. Our cybersecurity insurance also provides coverage in relation to regulatory action defense including oversight, investigations and disclosure obligations as well as fines and penalties, potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion; however, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered and/or may exceed the amount of any coverage and do not cover the time and effort we incur investigating and responding to any incidents, which may be significant. \n\nWe are and may continue to be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures. Such incidents may impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business, including our ability to deliver services to our customers. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our enterprise, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could result in: \n\n&#8226; harm to customers; \n\n&#8226; business interruptions and delays; \n\n&#8226; the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data, confidential information or intellectual property; \n\n&#8226; litigation, including potential class action litigation, and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; \n\n&#8226; reputational damage; \n\n&#8226; significant remediation costs, including liability for stolen customer or employee information, repairing system damage, or providing benefit to affected customers or employees; \n\n&#8226; increase to insurance premiums; and \n\n&#8226; foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, violations or sanctions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. \n\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results. \n\nWe rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. System failures or outages, including any potential disruptions due to significantly increased global demand on certain cloud-based systems, or failures to adequately scale our data platforms and architectures support patient care could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business or delay our financial reporting. Such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware or other malware, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security. In addition, certain countries have implemented or may implement legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet, including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content. Other countries have attempted or \n\nare attempting to change or limit the legal protections available to businesses that depend on the internet for the delivery of their services. If our systems are breached or suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may significantly suffer and we may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions and other actions for which we could face financial liability and other adverse consequences which may include: \n\n&#8226; additional government oversight of our operations; \n\n&#8226; loss of existing customers; \n\n&#8226; difficulty in attracting new customers; \n\n&#8226; problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; \n\n&#8226; difficulty in preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud; \n\n&#8226; disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals; \n\n&#8226; increases in operating expenses, incurrence of expenses, including notification and remediation costs; \n\n&#8226; regulatory fines or penalties; \n\n&#8226; individual actions or class actions for damages; \n\n&#8226; loss of revenues (including through loss of coverage or reimbursement); \n\n&#8226; product development delays; \n\n&#8226; disruption of key business operations; and \n\n&#8226; diversion of attention of management and key information technology resources. \n\nCyber-attacks aimed at accessing our devices, products, and services, or related devices, products, and services, and modifying or using them in a way inconsistent with our FDA clearances and approvals could create risks to users. \n\nMedical devices are increasingly connected to the internet, hospital networks, and other medical devices to provide features that improve healthcare and increase the ability of healthcare providers to treat patients and patients to manage their conditions. For example, we are pursuing collaborations to enable the connectivity and interoperability of our current and next-generation sensors and transmitters with third-party patient monitoring products, which may in turn be connected with the internet, hospital networks and in some cases, other medical devices. These same features may also increase cybersecurity risks and the risks of unauthorized access and use by third parties. As such, a cyber-attack which intrudes, disrupts, or corrupts our devices, products, and services, or related devices, products, and services could impact the quality-of-care patients receive or the confidentiality of patient information. Additionally, modifying or using any such devices, products, or services in a way inconsistent with our FDA clearances and approvals, which may create risks to users and potential exposure to the company. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Non-Compliance with Laws, Regulations and Contractual Requirements and Healthcare Industry Shifts ##TABLE_END\n\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with applicable laws and government regulations, we could become subject to penalties, be excluded from participation in government programs, and/or be required to make significant changes to our operations. \n\nThe healthcare industry generally, and our business specifically, is subject to extensive foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to: \n\n&#8226; authorizations necessary for the clinical investigation and commercial marketing of products; \n\n&#8226; the pricing of our products and services; \n\n&#8226; the distribution of our products and services; \n\n&#8226; the dispensing of our products; \n\n&#8226; billing for or causing the submission of claims for our products and services; \n\n&#8226; financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources; \n\n&#8226; inducements and courtesies given to physicians and other health care providers and patients; \n\n&#8226; labeling, advertising and promoting products; \n\n&#8226; the characteristics and quality of our products and services; \n\n&#8226; communications with payors and physicians and other healthcare stakeholders; \n\n&#8226; confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records and individually \n\nidentifiable health and other personal information; \n\n&#8226; medical device adverse event reporting; \n\n&#8226; prohibitions on kickbacks, including the Anti-Kickback Statute and related laws and/or regulations; \n\n&#8226; any scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program; \n\n&#8226; physician and other healthcare professional payment disclosure requirements; \n\n&#8226; use and disclosure of personal health information; \n\n&#8226; privacy of health information and personal information; \n\n&#8226; data protection and data localization; \n\n&#8226; mobile communications; \n\n&#8226; patient access and non-discrimination; \n\n&#8226; patient consent; \n\n&#8226; false claims; and \n\n&#8226; licensure. \n\nThese laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, still evolving. If our operations are found to violate any of the foreign, federal, state or local laws and regulations which govern our activities, we may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions, and applicable penalties associated with the violation, potentially including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in certain payor programs or curtailment of our operations. Compliance obligations under these various laws are oftentimes detailed and onerous, further contributing to the risk that we could be found to be out of compliance with particular requirements. The risk of being found in violation of these laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, particularly with respect to new and emerging technologies and remote delivery of services, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. \n\nThe FDA, CMS, OIG, OCR, FTC, Department of Justice, states&#8217; attorneys general and other governmental authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations discussed above. In the United States, medical device manufacturers have been the target of numerous government prosecutions and investigations alleging violations of law, including claims asserting impermissible off-label promotion of medical devices, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state healthcare business, and submission of false claims for government reimbursement. While we make every effort to comply with applicable laws, we cannot rule out the possibility that the government or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and challenge our practices under one or more of these laws. This likelihood of allegations of non-compliance is increased by the fact that under certain federal and state laws applicable to our business, individuals may bring an action on behalf of the government alleging violations of such laws, and potentially be awarded a share of any damages or penalties ultimately awarded to the applicable government body. \n\nThe FDA and the FTC share oversight of medical device promotion. The FDA has broad authority over device marketing (including assessment and oversight of safety and effectiveness) and over FDA-approved &#8220;promotional labeling,&#8221; while the FTC has authority over &#8220;advertising&#8221; for most medical devices (i.e., non-&#8220;restricted&#8221; devices, such as ours). \n\nAny action against us alleging a violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s time and attention from the operation of our business, and have a material effect on our business. \n\nIn addition, the laws and regulations impacting or affecting our business may change significantly in the future. Any new laws or regulations may adversely affect our business, including any changes in laws and regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic or expiration of waivers and other regulatory flexibilities following expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. A review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities may result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations. Also, the regulatory environment applicable to our business may change in a way that restricts or adversely impacts our operations. \n\nIf we or our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we have unanticipated problems with our products, the products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market. \n\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, clearance or authorization (and the activities related to its production, distribution, and promotion, sale, and marketing) will be subject to continual review and periodic \n\ninspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which may include inspection of our manufacturing processes, complaint handling and adverse event reporting, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product. The FDA&#8217;s Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, it would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. \n\nIf the FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that a device intended for human use would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death, the agency may issue a cease distribution and notification order and a mandatory recall order. We may also decide to recall a product voluntarily if we find a material deficiency, including unacceptable risks to health, manufacturing defects, design errors, component failures, labeling defects, or other issues. Recalls of our products could divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \n\nWe and certain of our suppliers are also required to comply with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and other regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, selection and oversight of suppliers or contractors, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage, complaint handling, shipping and servicing of our products. The FDA may enforce the QSR through announced (through prior notification) or unannounced inspections. \n\nCompliance with ongoing regulatory requirements can be complex, expensive and time-consuming. Failure by us or one of our suppliers or distributors to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, competent authorities and other regulatory bodies, or failure to take adequate response to any observations, could result in, among other things, any of the following actions: \n\n&#8226; warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action; \n\n&#8226; delays in approving, or refusal to approve, our CGM systems; \n\n&#8226; fines and civil or criminal penalties; \n\n&#8226; unanticipated expenditures; \n\n&#8226; FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export our products for sale in other countries; \n\n&#8226; suspension or withdrawal of clearance or approval by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; \n\n&#8226; product recall or seizure; \n\n&#8226; administrative detention; \n\n&#8226; interruption of production, partial suspension, or complete shutdown of production; \n\n&#8226; interruption of the supply of components from our key component suppliers; \n\n&#8226; operating restrictions; \n\n&#8226; court consent decrees; \n\n&#8226; FDA orders to repair, replace, or refund the cost of devices; \n\n&#8226; injunctions; and \n\n&#8226; criminal prosecution. \n\nThe potential effect of these events can in some cases be difficult to quantify. If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer. In addition, we believe events that could be classified as reportable events pursuant to MDR regulations are generally underreported by physicians and users, and any underlying problems could be of a larger magnitude than suggested by the number or types of MDRs filed by us. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. \n\nEven if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted, the approval or clearance may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing or surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including software bugs, unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as the QSR, MDR reporting, or other post-market requirements may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls (through corrections or removals), fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, or criminal prosecution. In addition, our distributors have rights to create marketing \n\nmaterials for their sales of our products, and may not adhere to contractual, legal or regulatory limitations that are imposed on their marketing efforts. \n\nQuality problems could lead to recalls or safety alerts, reputational harm, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nQuality is very important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure, and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. Since the first commercial launch of our products in 2006, we have had periodic field failures related to our products and associated services, including reports of sensor errors, sensor failures, broken sensors, receiver malfunctions, audible alarms and alert failures, as well as server and transmitter failures. To comply with the FDA&#8217;s medical device reporting requirements, for example, we have filed reports of applicable field failures. Although we believe we have taken and are taking appropriate action aimed at reducing and/or eliminating field failures, we may have other product failures in the future. Product or component failures, manufacturing nonconformances, design defects, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products, if they were to occur, could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recalls, corrections or removals of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits. \n\nAdditionally, the production of our products must occur in a highly controlled and clean environment to minimize particles and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. Weaknesses in process control or minute impurities in materials may cause a substantial percentage of defective products. If we are not able to maintain stringent quality controls, or if contamination problems arise, our clinical development and commercialization efforts could be delayed, which would harm our business and our results of operations. \n\nIf we fail to meet any applicable product quality standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, our reputation could be harmed and our revenue and results of operations could decline. \n\nPotential long-term complications from our current or future products or other CGM systems under development may not be revealed by our clinical experience to date. \n\nBased on our experience, complications from use of our products may include sensor errors, sensor failures, broken sensors, lodged sensors or skin irritation under the adhesive dressing of the sensor. Inflammation or redness, swelling, minor infection, and minor bleeding at the sensor insertion site are also possible risks with an individual&#8217;s use of our products. However, if unanticipated long-term side-effects result from the use of our products or other glucose monitoring systems we have under development, we could be subject to liability and the adoption of our systems may become more limited. With respect to our G6 systems, our clinical trials have been limited to ten days of continuous use. It is possible that the data from our clinical studies and trials may not be indicative of long-term patient outcomes. We cannot assure you that repeated, long-term use would not result in unanticipated adverse effects, potentially even after the sensor is removed. \n\nWe may never receive approval, marketing authorization or clearance from the U.S. FDA and other governmental agencies to market additional CGM systems, expanded indications for use of current and future generation CGM systems, future software platforms, or any other products under development. \n\nIn March 2018, via the de novo process, the FDA classified the G6 and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type (i.e., &#8220;integrated continuous glucose monitoring systems&#8221; or &#8220;iCGMs&#8221;) into Class II, meaning that going forward products of this generic type may utilize the 510(k) pathway. Since then we have received 510(k) clearances for modifications to the G6 and approval for G7. \n\nAny subsequent modifications of our cleared products that could significantly affect their safety or effectiveness (for example, a significant change in design or manufacture), or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require us to obtain a new 510(k) clearance or could require a new de novo submission or a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until appropriate clearance or approval is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. \n\nIf future product candidates are not deemed by the FDA to meet the criteria for submission under the 510(k) pathway, or for down-classification under the de novo process or otherwise, we would need to pursue a PMA. The PMA process requires us to prove the safety and effectiveness of our systems to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. This process can be expensive, prolonged and uncertain, requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and human \n\nclinical data, and may never result in the FDA granting a PMA. The FDA&#8217;s de novo classification of our G6 system under the generic name &#8220;integrated continuous glucose monitoring system,&#8221; makes it a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions. Complying with this classification requires ongoing compliance with the general controls required by the federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and the special controls specified by the FDA&#8217;s G6 order as a Class II device. Any future system or expanded indications for use of current generation systems will require approval of the applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, we intend to seek either 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals for certain changes and modifications to our existing software platform, but cannot predict when, if ever, those changes and modifications will be approved. \n\nThe FDA can refuse to grant a 510(k) clearance or a de novo request for marketing authorization, or delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application or supplement for many reasons, including: \n\n&#8226; the system may not be deemed by the FDA to be substantially equivalent to appropriate predicate devices under the 510(k) pathway; \n\n&#8226; the system may not satisfy the FDA&#8217;s safety or effectiveness requirements; \n\n&#8226; the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval; \n\n&#8226; the manufacturing process or facilities used may not meet applicable requirements; and \n\n&#8226; changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. \n\nEven if approved or cleared by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, future generations of our CGM systems, expanded indications for use of current and future generation CGM systems, our software platforms or any other CGM system under development, may not be cleared or approved for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. We may not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances to market these CGM systems in the United States or outside of the United States. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products. The uncertain timing of regulatory approvals for future generations of our products could subject our current inventory to excess or obsolescence charges, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. \n\nOur failure to comply with laws, regulations and contract requirements relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and contractual requirements regulating the provision of, and reimbursement for, health care goods and services in our capacity as a medical device manufacturer. The laws and regulations of health care goods and services that apply to us, including those described above, are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. We have in place a compliance program, through which we seek to reduce common industry risks of noncompliance with U.S. federal and state and applicable foreign laws in areas such as sales contracts, marketing materials, referral source relationships, programmatic offerings, and billing practices (among others), monitor for compliance, and address non-compliance if identified. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers, directors and employees could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, as well as administrative sanctions such as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, including but not limited to Medicare and Medicaid. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations or contractual requirements relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nOur products are purchased principally by individual patients, who may be eligible for insurance coverage of their devices from various third-party payors, such as governmental programs ( e.g. , Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, other federal and state health benefit plans, and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans, and managed care plans. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our products are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by the U.S. Department of Health &#38; Human Services, including CMS, as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services. The principal U.S. federal laws relating to reimbursement include those that prohibit (i) the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment, known as the federal civil False Claims Act, (ii) unlawful inducements for the referral of items and services reimbursed by Federal health care programs, known as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and (iii) the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, including its prohibitions on Beneficiary Inducement. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other government-funded programs, as well as, in some cases, to all payors, including self-pay patients. Insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action claiming treble damages against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations \n\nAct, or RICO. Additionally, as a manufacturer of FDA&#8209;approved or -cleared devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to certain U.S.-licensed health care professionals and U.S. teaching hospitals, and under an expansion of the law to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. \n\nWith respect to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Congress and the OIG have established a large number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect financial relationships with our customers and referral sources. An arrangement that fits squarely into an exception or safe harborwill not be deemed to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. \n\nWe train and educate employees and marketing representatives on the Anti-Kickback Statute and their obligations thereunder, and we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors. However, some of our arrangements, like many other common and non-abusive arrangements, may implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute and are not covered by a safe harbor, but nevertheless we do not believe them to present a significant risk to beneficiaries or federal healthcare programs and, as such, appear unlikely to invite government scrutiny or prosecution, warrant the imposition of sanctions, or be found to violate the statute. However, we cannot offer assurance that the government or a whistleblower would agree with our position that certain arrangements fall within a safe harbor, or that arrangements that do not squarely meet an exception or safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can also trigger liability under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law and federal civil False Claims Act, thereby increasing the penalty structure for these violations. \n\nDuring the period in which we directly billed Medicare, our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members were required to comply with the federal Physician Self-Referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, by meeting an applicable exception. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is unintentional. Violations of the Stark Law create overpayment liability under the federal civil False Claims Act and can also trigger separate penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. Knowing violations of the Stark Law carry increased civil monetary penalties and would likely be classified as the knowing submission of a false claim or knowingly making a false statement to the government, triggering liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Certain Stark Law violations can also trigger exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Historical violations of the Stark Law, if any, could continue to give rise to liability during the six year statute of limitations period. \n\nManaged care trends and consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. \n\nPrivate third-party payors and other managed care organizations, such as pharmacy benefit managers, continue to take action to manage utilization and control costs. Consolidation among managed care organizations has increased the negotiating power of managed care organizations and other private third-party payors. Private third-party payors, as well as governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. Failure to obtain or maintain timely adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our products, or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing, could adversely impact revenue. Private third-party payors, including self-insured employers, often implement formularies with co-payment tiers to encourage utilization of certain products and have also been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularly for higher-cost products. Private third-party payors also use additional measures such as value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost-containment efforts. Private third-party payors also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as requiring prior authorization or requiring the patient to first fail on a lower-cost product before permitting access to a higher-cost product. \n\nMany health care industry companies, including health care systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are also consolidating or vertically integrating, or have formed strategic alliances. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense. This consolidation will continue to create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can try to use to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us. \n\nAs the U.S. payor market consolidates further and we face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors, who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost alternatives, we may lose customers, our revenues may decrease and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may suffer. \n\nIf we are unable to successfully complete the pre-clinical studies or clinical trials necessary to support additional PMA, de novo, or 510(k) applications or supplements, we may be unable to commercialize our CGM systems under development, which could impair our business, financial condition and operating results. \n\nTo support current and any future additional PMA, 510(k), de novo applications or supplements, we together with our partners, must successfully complete pre-clinical studies, bench-testing, and in some cases clinical trials that will demonstrate that the product is safe and effective. Product development, including pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays (including any potential delays due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and failure at any stage. Furthermore, the data obtained from the studies and trials may be inadequate to support approval of an application and the FDA may request additional clinical data in support of those applications, which may result in significant additional clinical expenses and may delay product approvals. While we have in the past obtained, and may in the future obtain, an investigational device exemption, or IDE, prior to commencing clinical trials for our products, FDA approval of an IDE application permitting us to conduct testing does not mean that the FDA will consider the data gathered in the trial to be sufficient to support approval of a PMA, de novo or 510(k) application or supplement, even if the trial&#8217;s intended safety and effectiveness endpoints are achieved. \n\nChanges to the regulatory landscape may impact our ability to obtain marketing authorization for future product developments. \n\nDevelopment or changes to the FDA or foreign regulatory approval standards and processes, including both legal and policy changes, could also delay or prevent the approval of our products submitted for review. For example, medical device cybersecurity continues to be an area of focus for and evolving guidance from FDA. \n\nAdditionally, at the end of 2022, Congress passed the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA which (among other things), and similarly to the 2022 FDA Guidance, requires device sponsors to submit clinical trial diversity action plans outlining the goals for increasing representation of participants from racial and ethnic minority populations that have been underrepresented in clinical trials. \n\nAny change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. The data contained in our submissions, including data drawn from our clinical trials, may not be sufficient to support clearance or approval of our products or additional or expanded indications. Medical device company stock prices have declined significantly in certain circumstances where companies have failed to meet expectations in regards to the timing of regulatory approval. If the FDA&#8217;s response causes product approval delays, or is not favorable for any of our products, our stock price (and the market price of our senior convertible notes) could decline substantially. It is uncertain how these potential changes may impact our ability to gain clearance or approval from FDA for our products in the future. \n\nThe commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of FDA marketing applications or supplements, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; \n\n&#8226; patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect; \n\n&#8226; patients or study site personnel who do not comply with clinical trial protocols; \n\n&#8226; patient follow-up does not occur at the rate we expect; \n\n&#8226; patients experience adverse side effects; \n\n&#8226; patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to our products; \n\n&#8226; institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject our clinical trial protocol; \n\n&#8226; third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the investigator agreements, clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA or institutional review board requirements; \n\n&#8226; we or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring or analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans; \n\n&#8226; third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or the study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or we or clinical investigators fail to disclose such interests; \n\n&#8226; regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities may results in allegations or findings of noncompliance and, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; \n\n&#8226; changes in governmental regulations, policies or administrative actions applicable to our trial protocols; \n\n&#8226; the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and \n\n&#8226; the FDA concludes that the results from our trial and/or trial design are inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product. \n\nFurther, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated shelter-in-place orders could limit or restrict our ability to initiate, conduct or continue our clinical trials. Delays and disruption in our clinical trials could results in delays for expanded FDA clearance or approval of our products. We are unable to predict the length of such delays or the scope of the ongoing impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trials at this time. We are continuing to monitor this situation and to explore methods of remote monitoring, remote clinical assessments and other similar delivery methods to permit the continuation of clinical trial activities. \n\nThe results of pre-clinical studies or other forms of early product testing do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results, and prior clinical trial results might not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our pre-clinical studies, product testing, and clinical trials, or may find the clinical trial design, conduct or results inadequate to prove safety or effectiveness, and may require us to pursue the development of additional data, which could further delay the approval of our products. If we are unable to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our products in our clinical trials to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, where clinical data are required, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the United States. In addition, the data we collect from our current clinical trials, our pre-clinical studies and other clinical trials may not be sufficient to support FDA approval, even if our endpoints are met. \n\nWe may also conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the relative or comparative effectiveness of CGM systems for the treatment of diabetes. These types of studies, which often require substantial investment and effort, may not show adequate, or any, clinical benefit or value for the use of CGM systems. \n\nOur CGM systems currently have regulatory marketing authorization limited to individual patient home-use, and have otherwise not received clearance or approval from the FDA or other regulators for use in hospital or other in-patient facility settings, although the FDA has advised us that it will not object to the use of our CGM systems in such settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our potential supply of our CGM systems for use in this environment during the COVID-19 pandemic may present risks to our business. \n\nWe have received, and may continue to receive, numerous inquiries from hospitals around the country about the use of our CGM devices to remotely monitor COVID-19 patients admitted into the hospital. Extension of CGM system use to hospitalized patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic allows hospital staff to monitor glucose remotely in patients and may reduce patient/provider interactions, which could help limit viral exposure for hospital staff and help conserve personal protective equipment. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has permitted for regulatory flexibility in a variety of specific circumstances, to expedite the development and availability of critical medical products that may be helpful in COVID-19-related efforts. \n\nFollowing direct communication with the FDA regarding the potential use of our CGM devices in a hospital or other in-patient setting, the FDA notified us on April 1, 2020 that in an exercise of its enforcement discretion it will not object, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to Dexcom providing CGM devices and support to users to enable real-time remote patient monitoring in hospitals and other healthcare facilities, to support COVID-19 healthcare-related efforts, so long as we provide certain FDA-specified information with respect to the unique challenges that CGM technologies can raise in the hospital environment. \n\nAs a condition of its exercise of enforcement discretion, the FDA has advised that we communicate the following information related to implementing the use of CGM systems for remote monitoring of hospitalized patients: \n\n&#8226; Hospitals should consider whether they have the resources and expertise necessary to adequately implement CGM use and provide appropriate training to healthcare providers. \n\n&#8226; CGM glucose results are less accurate than blood glucose results obtained using traditional testing methods (e.g., lab glucose, blood glucose meters). Users should consider all CGM glucose information (e.g., trend) along with individual glucose values, and interpret CGM results in the context of the full clinical picture. \n\n&#8226; CGM systems are subject to interferences that may generate falsely high and falsely low glucose readings. Levels of interference depend on drug concentration; substances that may not significantly interfere in non-hospitalized patients may interfere when used in the hospital setting because of higher dose levels. Most drugs used in hospital or critical care settings have not been evaluated and their interference with CGM systems is unknown. Known interferences vary by CGM brand, and can include Acetaminophen, Ascorbic acid, Hydroxyurea, or other reducing drugs/ compounds. \n\n&#8226; Poor peripheral blood perfusion may cause inaccurate sensor readings. CGM results should be interpreted considering accompanying patient conditions and medications. Other clinical conditions may also cause inaccurate readings. \n\nOur provision of our CGM systems to hospitals and other healthcare facilities for use during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have and will continue to have the above notice. \n\nIn February 2022, we received Breakthrough Device designation for our G6 CGM system in the hospital setting. The FDA&#8217;s Breakthrough Device designation is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medical devices that hold the potential for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition. \n\nWe are not actively promoting nor do we plan to actively promote our CGM devices (and related support) for inpatient use, but if we supply them to such facilities as currently permitted by the FDA, this supply could present an increased risk of product liability claims and associated damages should an adverse event occur. Given that our CGM devices have not yet been fully evaluated or tested by either us or the FDA to the extent that would be required in standard circumstances for product development and marketing authorization, there could be unknown or unanticipated risks presented by use in this environment. \n\nThe FDA can also decide, at any time, to change its position regarding its Breakthrough Device Designation and/or enforcement discretion for our devices, and require that we seek marketing authorization for this additional intended use by submitting a 510(k) premarket notification, or that we seek and obtain Emergency Use Authorization. The FDA may determine this policy has expired if the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic subsides or the federal public health emergency declaration is lifted and there is no longer an urgent need to use our CGM systems for remote patient monitoring during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nAs we are unable to predict the duration or ultimate impact of the provision of our CGM systems to hospitals and other healthcare facilities for use during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic at this time, we do not yet know the ultimate impact to our business or financial results. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. \n\nWe depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis, and, as a result, we may face costs and delays that are outside of our control. \n\nWe rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials, and other third parties to manage the trial and to perform related data collection and analysis. However, we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that clinical sites may devote to our clinical trials. If these clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to ensure compliance by patients with clinical protocols or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we will be unable to complete these trials, which could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our products. Our agreements with clinical investigators and clinical sites for clinical testing place substantial responsibilities on these parties and, if these parties fail to perform as expected, our trials could be delayed or terminated. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, or the clinical data may be rejected by the FDA, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products. \n\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many healthcare facilities were or remain closed or available on a limited basis for non-emergent and elective services. Accordingly, our clinical investigators may not have an opportunity to recruit and enroll patients in our clinical trials and there may be less interest by patients to participate. We cannot predict the trajectory of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of variants, the length or impact of current shelter-in-place orders or any limitation on the provision of non-emergent health services or the normal operation of our clinical sites. Therefore, we cannot predict the ultimate impact that such restrictions may have on our clinical trial enrollment and results. \n\nHealth care policy changes, including U.S. health care reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payors to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. health care system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. \n\nIn November 2020, the OIG published a Special Fraud Alert addressing manufacturer Speaker Programs, signaling both a more narrow government view of AKS compliance with respect to such programs as well as the potential for increased enforcement in this space by government oversight agencies such as the OIG and DOJ. On March 18, 2022, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed, announced revisions to its Code of Ethics on Interactions with Health Care Professionals (&#8220;Code&#8221;). The revised Code, effective June 1, addressed concerns noted in the OIG&#8217;s Special Fraud Alert, addressing things like virtual meetings, speaker programs and alcohol at events. The revised Code also addresses value-based care arrangements. We continue to assess industry responses to the Special Fraud Alert and have and may continue to make modifications to certain aspects of our speaker programs, which may have a detrimental impact on our ability to educate healthcare providers about our products and to promote use of our products, which may lead to decreased product sales and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nComprehensive healthcare legislation, signed into law in the United States in March 2010, titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the ACA, imposes certain stringent compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on companies in various sectors of the life sciences industry, and enhanced penalties for non-compliance. Despite the ACA going into effect over a decade ago, there have been numerous legal and Congressional challenges to the law&#8217;s provisions and the effect of certain provisions have made compliance costly. \n\nWe cannot predict what additional new legislation, agency priorities, and rulemaking may be on the horizon as the United States continue to reassess how it pays for healthcare. As a result, we cannot quantify or predict what impact any changes might have on our business and results of operations. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for our products could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOther legal, regulatory and commercial policy influences are subjecting our industry to significant changes, and we cannot predict whether new regulations or policies will emerge from U.S. federal or state governments, foreign governments, or third-party payors. Government and commercial payors may, in the future, consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect reimbursement for healthcare products such as our systems. These policies have included, and may in the future include: basing reimbursement policies and rates on clinical outcomes, the comparative effectiveness, and costs, of different treatment technologies and modalities; imposing price controls and taxes on medical device providers; and other measures. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere could also have a negative impact on the demand for our current and future products. These include changes that may reduce reimbursement rates for our products and changes that may be proposed or implemented by the current or future laws or regulations. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Intellectual Property Protection and Use ##TABLE_END\n\nWe are subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from shipping affected products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief. We may also be subject to other claims or suits. \n\nThird parties have asserted, and may assert, infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our current or future products. We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that may relate to aspects of our business, including the design and manufacture of CGM sensors and membranes, as well as methods for continuous glucose monitoring. Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of such third parties or others. Our competitors may assert that our CGM systems or the methods we employ in the use of our systems are covered by U.S. or foreign patents held by them. We have in the past settled some such allegations and may need to do so again in the future. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that there are numerous issued patents and pending patent applications relating to self-monitored glucose testing systems in the \n\nmedical technology field. Because patent applications may take years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more components of our system may inadvertently infringe. As the number of competitors in the market for CGM systems grows, the possibility of patent infringement by us or a patent infringement claim against us increases. If we are unable to successfully defend any such claims as they may arise or enter into or extend settlement and license agreements on acceptable terms or at all, our business operations may be harmed. We have been involved in various patent infringement actions in the past. For example, in July 2014, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Abbott to settle all pending patent infringement legal proceedings brought by Abbott against us, which expired on March 31, 2021. Since the expiration of that agreement, we and certain Abbott entities have served complaints for patent infringement, validity, and other patent-related actions against each other in multiple jurisdictions, inside and outside the United States. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims and defenses in these cases to protect our intellectual property and to defend against Abbott&#8217;s infringement allegations. \n\nAny infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management&#8217;s attention from our business and harm our reputation. In addition, if the relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe such patents, we could be prohibited from selling any of our products that is found to infringe unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent. We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. We may be unable to maintain or renew licenses on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may be prohibited from selling any of our products that required the technology covered by the relevant licensed patents. Even if we are able to redesign our products to avoid an infringement claim, we may not receive FDA approval for such changes in a timely manner or at all. \n\nAny adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we are or may become a party relating to patents or other intellectual property rights could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from other third parties. If we are found to infringe third-party patents, a court could order us to pay damages to compensate the patent owner for the infringement, such as a reasonable royalty amount and/or profits lost by the patent owners, along with prejudgment and/or post-judgment interest. Furthermore, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents, we could, in addition to other penalties, be required to pay treble damages; and if the court finds the case to be exceptional, we may be required to pay attorneys&#8217; fees for the prevailing party. If we are found to infringe third-party copyrights or trademarks or misappropriate third-party trade secrets, based on the intellectual property at issue, a court could order us to pay statutory damages, actual damages, or profits, such as reasonable royalty or lost profits of the owners, unjust enrichment, disgorgement of profits, and/or a reasonable royalty, and the court could potentially award attorneys&#8217; fees or exemplary or enhanced damages. Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and would likely include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary intellectual property licenses on satisfactory terms. If we do not obtain any such necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement and any redesign may not receive FDA approval or other requisite marketing authorization in a timely manner or at all. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary intellectual property licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business. If litigation were to be initiated by intellectual property owners, there could significant legal fees and costs incurred in defending litigation (which may include filing administrative actions to attack the intellectual property) as well as a potential monetary settlement payment to the owners, even if the matter is resolved before going to trial. Moreover, the owners may take an overly aggressive approach and/or include multiple allegations in a single litigation. \n\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to various claims, complaints and legal actions arising out of the ordinary course of business, including commercial insurance, product liability or employment-related matters. Also, from time to time, we may bring claims or initiate lawsuits against various third parties with respect to matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including commercial and employment-related matters. We do not believe we are party to any currently pending legal proceedings, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that existing or future legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nOur inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete. \n\nOur success and our ability to compete depend, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark law, and trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. However, such methods may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. Our patent applications may not issue as patents in a form that will be advantageous to us, or at all. Our issued patents, and those that may issue in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products. In addition, there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. \n\nTo protect our proprietary rights, we may in the future need to assert claims of infringement against third parties. The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation. In the event of an adverse judgment, a court could hold that some or all of our asserted intellectual property rights are not infringed, or are invalid or unenforceable, and could award attorney fees. \n\nDespite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not succeed in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, third parties may be able to design around our patents. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. \n\n##TABLE_START Litigation Risks ##TABLE_END\n\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and may be subject to damages, fines, penalties and injunctions, among other things. \n\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices, including those which may arise from the misuse (including system hacking or other unauthorized access by third parties to our systems) or malfunction of, or design flaws in, our products. This liability may vary based on the FDA classification associated with our devices. Notably, the classification of our G6 and G7 systems as Class II medical devices is likely to weaken our ability to rely on federal preemption of state law claims that assert liability against us for harms arising from use of those systems. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause, or merely appear to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by customers, healthcare providers or others selling our products. The risk of product liability claims may increase given that G6 and G7 do not require confirmatory finger sticks when making treatment decisions or finger stick tests each day for calibration, although it does require finger stick tests when symptoms do not match readings and when readings are unavailable. The risk of claims may also increase if our products are subject to a product recall or seizure. An example of the difficulty of complying with the regulatory requirements associated with the manufacture of our products, we issued notifications to our customers regarding the audible alarms and alerts associated with our receivers. \n\nAlthough we have insurance at levels that we believe is appropriate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. Our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. Further, if additional products are approved for marketing, we may seek additional insurance coverage. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability claim, recall or other claims with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could result in significant costs and significant harm to our business. \n\nWe may be subject to claims against us even if the apparent injury is due to the actions of others or misuse of the device or a partner device. Our customers, either on their own or following the advice of their physicians, may use our products in a manner not described in the products&#8217; labeling and that differs from the manner in which it was used in clinical studies and approved by the FDA. For example, our current systems are designed to be used by an individual continuously for up to 10 days for our G6 and G7 systems, but the individual might be able to circumvent the safeguards designed into the systems and use the products for longer than 10 days. Off-label use of products by customers is common, and any such off-label use of our products could subject us to additional liability, or require design changes to limit this potential off-label use once discovered. In addition, other regulatory agencies may in the future approve similar diabetes treatment indications. We expect that such diabetes treatment indications \n\ncould expose us to additional liability. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts. Defending a suit, regardless of merit, could be costly, could divert management attention and might result in adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal of, or inability to recruit, clinical trial volunteers or result in reduced acceptance of our products in the market. \n\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have received and continue to receive, numerous requests from hospitals and healthcare facilities around the country regarding the use of our CGM devices to remotely monitor COVID-19 patients admitted into the hospital. As noted above, in 2020, the FDA informed us that they intend to exercise enforcement discretion and will not object to our provision of G6 CGM systems to such facilities for use in the inpatient setting during the pandemic. However, our CGM devices are currently approved only for in-home use by patients for the purpose of personal diabetes management and have not otherwise been cleared or approved by the FDA for hospital use. Given that the G6 CGM has not yet been fully evaluated or tested (by us or by the FDA) to the extent that would be required in standard circumstances for product development and marketing authorization, there could be unknown or unanticipated risks presented by use in this environment. To the extent that inpatient use of our CGM systems causes or contributes to an adverse event, we may be subjected to additional product liability lawsuits. Defending a suit, regardless of merit, could be costly, could divert management attention and might result in adverse publicity, which could result in reduced acceptance of our products in the market. \n\nWe could become the subject of governmental investigations, claims and litigation. \n\nHealthcare companies are subject to numerous investigations and inquiries by various governmental agencies. Further, under the False Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring qui tam , or &#8220;whistleblower,&#8221; suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Depending upon whether the underlying conduct alleged in such inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, any resolution of any such investigations could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. \n\nGovernmental agencies and their agents, such as CMS Medicare Administrative Contractors and other CMS contractors, as well as the OIG, state Medicaid programs, and other state and federal agencies may conduct audits of our operations, relating to covered items and services including those furnished to beneficiaries, health care providers and distributors. Commercial and government-funded managed care payors may conduct similar post-payment audits. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our compliance program includes internal audit and monitoring functions designed to identify potential issues and facilitate remediation as appropriate. \n\nAny future investigations of our executives, our managers or us could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity. Even if we are found to have complied with applicable law, the investigation or litigation may pose a considerable expense and would divert management&#8217;s attention, and have a potentially negative impact on the public&#8217;s perception of us, all of which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. Further, should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. \n\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties and injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or improper off-label uses or determined to have made claims that are untruthful or misleading or not adequately substantiated. \n\nOur marketing, promotional and educational materials and practices are subject to FDCA, Federal Trade Commission Act, and other applicable laws and regulations, as may be amended from time to time. If the FDA, FTC or other regulatory body with competent jurisdiction over us, our activities or products takes the position that our marketing, promotional or other materials or activities constitute improper promotion or marketing of an unapproved or improper use, or that they contain untruthful, misleading, or inadequately substantiated statements or claims, such regulatory body could request that we modify our materials or practices, or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance, depending on the regulatory body and the nature of the alleged violation, of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional, marketing or other materials or activities to constitute improper promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Recent court decisions have impacted the FDA&#8217;s enforcement activity regarding off-label promotion in light of First Amendment considerations; however, there are still significant risks in this area in part due to the potential False Claims Act \n\nexposure and the FDA&#8217;s continued focus on ensuring devices are marketed in a manner consistent with their FDA-required labeling. \n\nWe are not actively promoting nor do we plan to actively promote our G6 or G7 systems for inpatient use, but if we supply them to such facilities as currently permitted by FDA, this supply could present an increased risk of product liability claims and associated damages should an adverse event occur. Given that the G6 and G7 systems have not yet been fully evaluated or tested (by us or by the FDA) to the extent that would be required in standard circumstances for product development and marketing authorization, there could be unknown or unanticipated risks presented by use in this environment. \n\nIn some instances in our advertising and promotion, we may make claims regarding our product as compared to competing products, which may subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, enforcement risk, and litigation risks. \n\nThe FDA applies a heightened level of scrutiny to comparative claims when applying its statutory standards for advertising and promotion, including with regard to its requirement that promotional labeling be truthful and not misleading. There is potential for differing interpretations of whether certain communications are consistent with a product&#8217;s FDA-required labeling, and FDA will evaluate communications on a fact-specific basis. \n\nIn addition, making comparative claims may draw concerns from our competitors. Where a company makes a claim in advertising or promotion that its product is superior to the product of a competitor (or that the competitor&#8217;s product is inferior), this creates a risk of a lawsuit by the competitor under federal and state false advertising or unfair and deceptive trade practices law, and possibly also state libel law. Such a suit may seek injunctive relief against further advertising, a court order directing corrective advertising, and compensatory and punitive damages where permitted by law. \n\nDirect-to-consumer marketing and social media efforts may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny. \n\nOur efforts to promote our products via direct-to-consumer marketing and social media initiatives may subject us to additional scrutiny of our practices of effective communication of risk information, benefits or claims, under the oversight of the FDA, FTC, HHS-OCR, or others. \n\n##TABLE_START Other Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Condition ##TABLE_END\n\nWe have incurred significant losses in the past and may incur losses in the future. \n\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the past. We have financed our operations primarily through private and public offerings of equity securities and debt and the sales of our products. We have devoted substantial resources to: \n\n&#8226; research and development relating to our continuous glucose monitoring systems; \n\n&#8226; sales and marketing and manufacturing expenses associated with the commercialization of our G6 and G7 systems; and \n\n&#8226; expansion of our workforce. \n\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our clinical trials and other development activities related to our products, including our next-generation sensors, transmitters and receivers, as well as other collaborations. We also expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase due, among other things, to the additional operational and regulatory burdens applicable to public healthcare and medical device companies. As a result, it is possible that we could incur operating losses in the future. These losses, among other things, may have an adverse effect on our stockholders&#8217; equity. \n\nOur success will depend on our ability to attract and retain our personnel and manage our human capital, while controlling labor costs. \n\nWe depend to a significant degree on our senior management, especially Kevin Sayer, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including salespersons, scientists, clinicians, engineers and other highly skilled personnel. Competition for senior management personnel, as well as salespersons, scientists, clinicians and engineers, is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel. The loss of the services of members of our senior management, scientists, clinicians or engineers could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives, including the commercialization of our current products and the development and introduction of additional products. The loss of a member of our senior management or our professional staff would require the remaining executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement. \n\nEach of our officers may terminate their employment at any time without notice and without cause or good reason. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. \n\nWe expect to continue to expand our operations and grow our research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing, product development and administrative operations. We expect this expansion to place a significant strain on our management and it will require hiring a significant number of qualified personnel. Accordingly, recruiting and retaining such personnel will be critical to our success. There is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. If we fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate these skilled personnel, we may be unable to continue our development and commercialization activities. \n\nWe may undertake reorganizations of our workforce, which may result in a temporary reduction in the number of employees in certain locations. We would undertake a reorganization to reduce operating expenses or achieve other business objectives, though we cannot guarantee any specific amount of long-term cost savings. Further, the turnover in our employee base could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies, which could adversely impact the results of our operations, stock price and customer relationships, and could make recruiting for future management and other positions more difficult. \n\nWe may conduct additional financings to continue the development or commercialization of our current or future generation CGM systems. \n\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on commercialization of our products, including growth of our manufacturing capacity, on research and development, and conducting clinical trials for our next-generation ambulatory CGM sensors and systems. Although we raised substantial net proceeds through the private sale of our convertible notes, we could need funds to continue the commercialization of our current products and to develop and commercialize our next-generation sensors and systems or pursue other strategic initiatives. Additional financing may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any additional financing may be dilutive to stockholders or may require us to grant a lender a security interest in our assets. The amount of funding we may need will depend on many factors, including: \n\n&#8226; the revenue generated by sales of our products and other future products; \n\n&#8226; the costs, timing and risks of delay of additional regulatory approvals; \n\n&#8226; the expenses we incur in manufacturing, developing, selling and marketing our products; \n\n&#8226; our ability to scale our manufacturing operations to meet demand for our current and any future products; \n\n&#8226; the costs to produce our continuous glucose monitoring systems; \n\n&#8226; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \n\n&#8226; the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities; \n\n&#8226; the success of our research and development efforts; \n\n&#8226; the emergence of competing or complementary technologies; \n\n&#8226; the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; \n\n&#8226; the cost of ongoing compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and third-party payors&#8217; policies; \n\n&#8226; the cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory or payor clearance or approval for our current or future products including those integrated with other companies&#8217; products; and \n\n&#8226; the acquisition of business, products and technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. \n\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may not be able to commercialize our products at the rate we desire and/or we may have to delay the development or commercialization of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. We also may have to reduce sales, marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products. Any of these factors could harm our business and financial condition. \n\nUncollectible uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nThe primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. In addition, as a result \n\nof the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some customers have, and others may, lose access to their private health insurance plan if they lose their job. As most of our customers rely on third-party payors, including private health insurance plans, to cover the cost of our products, there has been, and may continue to be, a shift in financial responsibility to our customers for the amounts previously covered by their primary insurance carrier. \n\nIn the event that we are unsuccessful in collecting payments owed by patients, and/or experience increases in the amount, or deterioration in the collectability, of uninsured and patient due accounts receivable, this could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts, as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures, due to evolving health care policy and insurance landscapes that shift greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions, prior authorizations, and copayment and deductible amounts. \n\nChanges in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses or the value of our assets. \n\nAs changes in our business environment occur we have adjusted, and may further, adjust our business strategies to meet these changes and we may otherwise decide to further restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. Our new organization and strategies may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. Our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies. In addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer patterns, acceptance of our products and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write-down the value of assets. For example, current conditions, including COVID-19 and our business decisions, may reduce the value of some of our assets. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in the international expansion of our sales efforts and the build-out of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia. Additionally, we also invest in early to late-stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and we may not realize a return on our equity investments. Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services, or technologies may be slow to develop or never materialize. We are subject to risks associated with our equity investments including partial or complete loss of invested capital, and significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could adversely impact our financial results, Some of these investments may have returns that are negative or low, the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments may be uncertain, and these risks may be exacerbated by COVID-19. In any of these events, our costs may increase or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Relating to Our Public Company Status, Tax Laws and Growth Through Acquisition ##TABLE_END\n\nWe may face risks associated with acquisitions of companies, products and technologies and our business could be harmed if we are unable to address these risks. \n\nIf we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we could acquire or make other investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. We may not realize the anticipated benefit of our acquisitions, or the realization of the anticipated benefits may require greater expenditures than anticipated by us. We will likely face risks, uncertainties and disruptions associated with the integration process, including difficulties in the integration of the operations and services of any acquired company, integration of acquired technology with our products, diversion of our management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses and impairment charges if future acquisitions are not as successful as we originally anticipated. If we fail to successfully integrate other companies, products or technologies that we acquire, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions or investments, the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. In addition, our operating results may suffer because of acquisition-related costs, amortization expenses or charges relating to acquired intangible assets. \n\nCompliance with regulations relating to public company corporate governance matters and reporting may strain our resources and divert management&#8217;s attention. \n\nMany laws and regulations, notably those adopted in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new SEC regulations and The Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules, impose obligations on public companies, such as ours, which have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. Compliance with these laws and regulations, including enhanced new disclosures, has required and will continue to require substantial management time and \n\noversight and the incurrence of significant accounting and legal costs. The effects of new laws and regulations remain unclear and will likely require substantial management time and oversight and require us to incur significant additional accounting and legal costs. Additionally, changes to existing accounting rules or standards, such as the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, may adversely impact our reported financial results and business, and may require us to incur greater accounting fees. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management&#8217;s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. \n\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, new U.S. or international tax legislation or additional tax liabilities. \n\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. The tax laws in the United States and in other countries in which we and our subsidiaries do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation, both in and outside the United States. \n\nThere is growing pressure in many jurisdictions, including the United States, and from multinational organizations such as the OECD and the European Union to amend existing international tax rules in order to render them more responsive to current global business practices. \n\nOur tax returns and other tax matters also are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We cannot guarantee the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States, or in other countries implementing legislation to reform existing tax legislation, including the European Union and Germany, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. \n\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations which could subject our business to higher tax liability. \n\nOur ability to use our net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations which could subject our business to higher tax liability. We may be limited in the portion of NOL carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, and federal tax credits to offset federal tax liabilities. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state law provisions, limit the use of NOLs and tax credits after a cumulative change in corporate ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. The statutes place a formula limit on how much NOLs and tax credits a corporation can use in a tax year after a change in ownership. Avoiding an ownership change is generally beyond our control. Although the ownership changes we experienced in the past have not prevented us from using all NOLs and tax credits accumulated before such ownership changes, we could experience another ownership change that might limit our use of NOLs and tax credits in the future. In addition, realization of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, depends upon our future earnings in applicable tax jurisdictions. If we have insufficient future taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdiction for any reason, including any future corporate reorganization or restructuring activities, we may be limited in our ability to utilize some or all of our net operating losses to offset such income and reduce our tax liability in that jurisdiction. We utilized the majority of our remaining NOLs by the end of 2021, with the exception of the NOLs limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. See Note 8 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. \n\nThere is also a risk that due to regulatory changes or changes to federal or state law, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable either in \n\nwhole or in part to offset future income tax liabilities. For example, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, or CARES Act, which amended certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 may be carried back to each of the five taxable years preceding the tax year of such loss, but NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 may not be carried back. The TCJA, as amended by the CARES Act, also provides that NOLs from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 may offset no more than 80% of current taxable income annually for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. \n\nValuation of share-based payments, which we are required to perform for purposes of recording compensation expense under authoritative guidance for share-based payment, involves assumptions that are subject to change and difficult to predict. \n\nWe record compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations for share-based payments, such as employee stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan shares, using the fair value method. The requirements of the authoritative guidance for share-based payment have and will continue to have a material effect on our future financial results reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and make it difficult for us to accurately predict the impact on our future financial results. \n\nFor instance, estimating the fair value of share-based payments is highly dependent on assumptions regarding the future exercise behavior of our employees and changes in our stock price. If there are errors in our input assumptions for our valuations models, we may inaccurately calculate actual or estimated compensation expense for share-based payments. \n\nThe authoritative guidance for share-based payment could also adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future financial results as assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value of share-based payments are based on estimates and judgments that may differ from period to period. We may also be unable to accurately predict the amount and timing of the recognition of tax benefits associated with share-based payments as they are highly dependent on the exercise behavior of our employees and the price of our stock relative to the exercise price of each outstanding stock option. \n\nFor those reasons, among others, the authoritative guidance for share-based payment may create variability and uncertainty in the share-based compensation expense we will record in future periods, which could adversely impact our stock price and increase our expected stock price volatility as compared to prior periods. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Our Common Stock ##TABLE_END\n\nOur stock price is highly volatile and investing in our stock involves a high degree of risk, which could result in substantial losses for investors. \n\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock, like the securities of many other medical products companies, fluctuates and could continue to be volatile in the future, especially as our business continues to grow and our business plan continues to evolve. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was as high as $132.89 per share and as low as $67.99 per share. In addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other medical device companies have been highly volatile as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nThe market price of our common stock is influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, including the following: \n\n&#8226; securities analyst coverage or lack of coverage of our common stock or changes in their estimates of our financial performance; \n\n&#8226; variations in quarterly operating results; \n\n&#8226; future sales of our common stock by our stockholders; \n\n&#8226; investor perception of us and our industry; \n\n&#8226; announcements by us or our competitors of significant agreements, acquisitions, or capital commitments or product launches or discontinuations; \n\n&#8226; changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors; \n\n&#8226; negative business or financial announcements regarding our partners; \n\n&#8226; general economic conditions; \n\n&#8226; regulatory actions; \n\n&#8226; legislation and political conditions; \n\n&#8226; global health pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; \n\n&#8226; the consummation, and the anticipated benefits, of our Share Repurchase Program; and \n\n&#8226; other events or factors, including the impact or perceived impact of our four-for-one forward stock split of our common stock, ongoing conflict in Ukraine, recessions, interest rates, local and national elections, international currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability and acts of war or terrorism . \n\nPlease also refer to the factors described elsewhere in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of companies in our industry. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. \n\nSecurities class action litigation has often been brought against public companies that experience periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. Securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and resources. \n\nThe issuance of shares by us in the future or sales of shares by our stockholders may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well. \n\nThis issuance of shares by us in the future, including by conversion of our senior convertible notes in certain circumstances, the issuance of shares of our common stock to partners, including up to 5,154,640 shares of our common stock that we may issue to Verily pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, or sales of shares by our stockholders may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, perhaps significantly, even if our business is performing well. The market price of our common stock could also decline if there is a perception that sales of our shares are likely to occur in the future. This might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Also, we may issue securities in connection with future financings and acquisitions, and those shares could dilute the holdings of other stockholders. \n\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. \n\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future and the terms of our credit agreement restrict our ability to declare or pay any dividends. As a result, stockholders (including holders of our senior convertible notes who receive shares of our common stock, if any, upon conversion of their notes) may only receive a return on their investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases. \n\nAnti-takeover effects of our charter documents and Delaware law could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock. \n\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions in the Delaware General Corporation Law, that may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that might otherwise be beneficial to stockholders. For example: \n\n&#8226; our Board of Directors may, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with special voting or economic rights; \n\n&#8226; our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights and, therefore, each of our directors can only be elected by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock; \n\n&#8226; a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by a majority of our Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or our Lead Independent Director; \n\n&#8226; our stockholders may not take action by written consent; \n\n&#8226; our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, only one of which is elected each year (however, over a three year period beginning with the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders the Board will be declassified and by the conclusion of this process all directors will be elected annually; and \n\n&#8226; we require advance notice for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. \n\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. In September 2020, we amended and restated our restated bylaws to provide that the federal district courts of the United States will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or a Federal Forum Provision. Our decision to adopt a Federal \n\nForum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Neither the exclusive forum provision nor the Federal Forum Provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. \n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder. \n\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. The exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. \n\nMoreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Our Debt ##TABLE_END\n\nIncreasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability. \n\nIn October 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amended Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase and other syndicate lenders, which amended and restated the credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, we had previously entered into in December 2018 and amended in May 2020. The Amended Credit Agreement is a five-year $200.0 million revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings, $7.3 million in outstanding letters of credit, and a total available balance of $192.7 million under the Amended Credit Agreement. \n\nOur leverage ratio may affect the availability to us of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways, including: \n\n&#8226; the terms on which credit may be available to us could be less attractive, both in the economic terms of the credit and the legal covenants; \n\n&#8226; the possible lack of availability of additional credit; \n\n&#8226; the potential for higher levels of interest expense to service or maintain our outstanding debt; \n\n&#8226; the possibility of additional borrowings in the future to repay our indebtedness when it comes due; and \n\n&#8226; the possible diversion of capital resources from other uses. \n\nWhile we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed, that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time, the then-current state of the credit and financial markets, and other factors that may be beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot give assurances that sufficient credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive, or at all, if and when necessary or beneficial to us. \n\nFailure to comply with covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement could result in our inability to borrow additional funds and adversely impact our business. \n\nThe Amended Credit Agreement imposes numerous financial and other restrictive covenants on our operations, including covenants relating to our general profitability and our liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants imposed by the Amended Credit Agreement. If we violate these or any other covenants, any outstanding amounts under the Amended Credit Agreement could become due and payable prior to their stated maturity dates, each lender could proceed against any collateral in our operating accounts and our \n\nability to borrow funds in the future may be restricted or eliminated. These restrictions may also limit our ability to borrow additional funds and pursue other business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests. \n\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to respond to changes in our business. \n\nIn November 2018, we completed an offering of $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75% senior convertible notes due 2023, or 2023 Notes, which offering we refer to as the 2018 Notes Offering. In May 2020, we completed an offering of approximately $1.21 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.25% senior convertible notes due 2025, or 2025 Notes, which offering we refer to as the 2020 Notes Offering. We refer to the 2018 Notes Offering and the 2020 Notes Offering, collectively, as the Notes Offerings, and we refer to the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes, collectively, as the Notes. As a result of the Notes Offerings, we incurred $2.06 billion principal amount of indebtedness, the principal amount of which we may be required to pay at maturity. \n\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for each of the Notes) at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, each indenture for the Notes provides that we are required to repay amounts due under each indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to the maturity date for the Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. \n\nAs a result of our level of increased debt after the completion of the Notes Offerings: \n\n&#8226; our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and competitive pressures will be heightened; \n\n&#8226; we will be required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes; \n\n&#8226; our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be more limited; and \n\n&#8226; our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired. \n\nWe cannot be sure that our leverage resulting from the level of increased debt after the completion of the Notes Offerings will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when required or, if available, will be on terms satisfactory to us. Further, even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use such proceeds to repay a portion of our debt. \n\nWe may be unable to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required by the holders or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts due under the notes upon an event of default or redeem the Notes unless specified conditions are met under our Credit Facility, and our future debt may contain additional limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion, repurchase or repayment of the Notes. \n\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. In addition, each indenture for the Notes provides that we are required to repay amounts due under each indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to the maturity date for the Notes. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase Notes surrendered upon a fundamental change or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts or pay cash for Notes being converted. \n\nIn addition, our ability to purchase the Notes or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts under the Notes upon an event of default or pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness outstanding at the time, including our Credit Facility. Under our Credit Facility, we are only permitted to use cash to purchase the Notes or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts under the Notes if we meet certain conditions that are defined under the Credit Agreement. We may not meet these conditions in the future. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the respective indenture (whether upon a fundamental change or otherwise under each indenture) or \n\npay cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under each indenture. A default under each indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness, including our Credit Facility. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. \n\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above. \n\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indentures governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt, or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the convertible senior notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. \n\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the 2023 Notes and our common stock. \n\nIn connection with the sale of the 2023 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge, or the 2023 Note Hedge, transactions with certain financial institutions, or option counterparties. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our common stock, or the 2023 Warrants. The 2023 Note Hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 2023 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2023 Notes. The 2023 Warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the 2023 Warrants, which is $49.60. \n\nThe option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of 2023 Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2023 Notes, or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the indenture for the 2023 Notes) or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the 2023 Notes, which could affect note holders&#8217; ability to convert the 2023 Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2023 Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that note holders will receive upon conversion of the 2023 Notes. \n\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the 2023 Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 2023 Notes (and as a result, the value of the consideration, the amount of cash and/or the number of shares, if any, that note holders would receive upon the conversion of the 2023 Notes) and, under certain circumstances, the ability of the note holders to convert the 2023 Notes. \n\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the 2023 Notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. \n\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 2023 Note Hedge transactions. \n\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the 2023 Note Hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties. \n\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt. \n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. We may not maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on (as well as any cash due upon conversion of) our debt, including the Notes. \n\nIf we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt servicing obligations. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and our ability to refinance the Notes, existing indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could result in a default on the Notes or our current and future indebtedness. \n\nOur Credit Facility imposes restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. \n\nOur Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, our Credit Facility and the agreements governing the notes each contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $25.0 million, in the case of the 2023 Notes, and $50.0 million, in the case of the 2025 Notes, that causes such indebtedness to become due prior to its scheduled maturity date would cause a cross-default under the indenture governing the Notes. In addition, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $25.0 million that causes such indebtedness to become due prior to its scheduled maturity date would cause a default under our Credit Facility. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the holders of the Notes or the lenders under our Credit Facility to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the Note holders or the trustee under the indenture governing the Notes or the lenders under our Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. \n\nConversion of the Notes will, to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of such Notes, dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress our stock price. \n\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress our stock price. \n\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of the Notes do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. \n\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, may have a material effect on our reported financial results. \n\nIf the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless \n\nwe elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than by paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we may settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, the consideration received upon the unwind or termination of the capped call transactions may not completely offset, and may be substantially less than, any cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the Notes we are required to make upon conversion of the Notes. Even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. \n\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over Dexcom. \n\nThe terms of the Notes require us to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change. A takeover of Dexcom would trigger an option of the holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, each indenture for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the notes. These and other provisions of each indenture may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of Dexcom. \n\n##TABLE_START Risks Related to Environmental, Social and Governance Matters \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance, or ESG, regulations, policies and provisions could expose us to numerous risks. \n\nIncreasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on ESG matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related data and information is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC&#8217;s proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. In addition, a number of our customers who are payors or distributors have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include ESG provisions that their suppliers or manufacturers must comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions in their terms and conditions. An increasing number of participants in the medical device industry are also joining voluntary ESG groups or organizations, such as the Responsible Business Alliance. These ESG provisions and initiatives are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and the outsourced manufacturing of certain components of our products. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or provisions, a customer may stop purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. \n\nOur business could be negatively impacted by evolving expectations and challenges relating to implementing ESG initiatives, setting ESG-related goals, collecting ESG-related data, and disclosing ESG-related information. \n\nWe may communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding ESG-related matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These ESG-related initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG-related goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected. \n\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business. \n\nWhile we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks related to climate change wherever business is conducted. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority. Our manufacturing sites in California, Arizona and Malaysia and our operations in the Philippines are vulnerable to climate change effects. For example, in California and Arizona, increasing intensity of \n\ndroughts throughout the states and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned and unplanned power outages in the communities where we work and live. While this danger has a low-assessed risk of disrupting normal business operations, it has the potential impact on employees&#8217; abilities to commute to work or to work from home and stay connected effectively. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on the U.S., the Philippines, Malaysia and other major regions&#8217; critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and/or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses, and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. \n\n##TABLE_START General Risk Factors ##TABLE_END\n\nCurrent uncertainty in domestic and global economic and political conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from expectations. \n\nOur operations and performance depend on worldwide economic and political conditions. These conditions have been adversely impacted by continued global economic uncertainty, political instability and military hostilities in multiple geographies (including the conflict between Ukraine and Russia), monetary and financial uncertainties in Europe and other foreign countries, global health pandemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, rising interest rates, and domestic and global inflationary trends. These include potential reductions in the overall stability and suitability of the Euro as a single currency, given the economic and political challenges facing individual Eurozone countries. These conditions have made and may continue to make it difficult for our customers and potential customers to afford our products, and could cause our customers to stop using our products or to use them less frequently. If that were to occur, our revenue may decrease and our performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, the pressure on consumers to absorb more of their own health care costs has resulted in some cases in higher deductibles and limits on durable medical equipment, which may cause seasonality in purchasing patterns. Furthermore, during economic uncertainty, our customers have had job losses and may continue to have issues gaining timely access to sufficient health insurance or credit, which could result in their unwillingness to purchase products or impair their ability to make timely payments to us. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. A recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event, including any such event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. \n\nWe cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of the economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States, or in our industry. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation. \n\nInflation has the potential to adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, components, manufacturing and shipping, as well as weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience cost increases. Although we may take measures to mitigate the effects of inflation, if these measures are not effective, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost of inflation is incurred. \n\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and our stock price and our business may be adversely impacted. \n\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and our management is required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. If we are not successful in maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, there could be inaccuracies or omissions in the consolidated financial information we are required to file with the SEC. Additionally, even if there are no inaccuracies or omissions, we will be required to publicly disclose the conclusion of our management that our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. These events could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, adversely \n\nimpact our stock price, result in increased costs to remediate any deficiencies, attract regulatory scrutiny or lawsuits that could be costly to resolve and distract management&#8217;s attention, limit our ability to access the capital markets or cause our stock to be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market or any other securities exchange on which it is then listed. \n\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue and/or expense fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations. \n\nA change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. The method in which we market and sell our products may have an impact on the manner in which we recognize revenue. In addition, changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Additionally, changes to existing accounting rules or standards, such as the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, may adversely impact our reported financial results and business, and may further require us to incur greater accounting fees. \n\nIf our financial performance fails to meet the expectations of investors and public market analysts, the market price of our common stock could decline. \n\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. If quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially. Factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results include: \n\n&#8226; our inability to manufacture an adequate supply of product at appropriate quality levels and acceptable costs; \n\n&#8226; possible delays in our research and development programs or in the completion of any clinical trials; \n\n&#8226; a lack of acceptance of our products in the marketplace by physicians and people with diabetes; \n\n&#8226; the inability of customers to receive reimbursements from third-party payors; \n\n&#8226; the purchasing patterns of our customers, including as a result of seasonality; \n\n&#8226; failures to comply with regulatory requirements, which could lead to withdrawal of products from the market; \n\n&#8226; our failure to continue the commercialization of any of our CGM systems; \n\n&#8226; competition; \n\n&#8226; inadequate financial and other resources; and \n\n&#8226; global political and economic conditions, political instability and military hostilities. \n\nWe may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by materials that we handle, and changes in environmental regulations could cause us to incur additional expense. \n\nOur research and development and clinical processes involve the handling of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials. We are subject to international and domestic (including federal, state and local) laws, rules and regulations governing the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous and biological materials and we incur expenses relating to compliance with these laws and regulations. If violations of environmental, health and safety laws occur, we could be held liable for damages, penalties and costs of remedial actions. These expenses or this liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition. We may violate environmental, health and safety laws in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business and environmental groups. Changes to or restrictions on permitting requirements or processes, hazardous or biological material storage or handling might require unplanned capital investment or relocation. Failure to comply with new or existing laws or regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START "

To complement our direct sales efforts, we have entered into distribution arrangements in North America and several international markets that allow distributors to sell our products. Future Developments \n\nProduct Development: We plan to develop future generations of technologies that are focused on improved performance and convenience and that will enable intelligent insulin administration. Over the longer term, we plan to continue to develop and improve networked platforms with open architecture, connectivity and transmitters capable of communicating with other devices. We also intend to expand our efforts to accumulate CGM patient data and metrics and apply predictive modeling and machine learning to generate interactive CGM insights that can inform patient behavior. \n\nPartnerships: We also continue to pursue and support development partnerships with insulin pump companies and companies or institutions developing insulin delivery systems, including automated insulin delivery systems. \n\nNew Opportunities: We are also exploring how to extend our offerings to other opportunities, including for people with Type 2 diabetes that are non-insulin using, people with pre-diabetes, people who are obese, people who are pregnant, and people in the hospital setting. Eventually, we may apply our technological expertise to products beyond glucose monitoring. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Impact of Current Events During 2020, 2021, and 2022, we have been subject to challenging social and economic conditions created as a result of the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, or COVID-19. These conditions continue to create various financial impacts to our operations by necessitating precautions for our personnel to operate safely both in person as well as remotely. Costs incurred include items like incremental payroll costs, consulting support, IT infrastructure and facilities-related costs. \n\nAs the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in coordination with an FDA communication of enforcement discretion, we made Dexcom CGM systems available for use in hospital settings and other healthcare facilities. The extent of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, employee or industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have become more prevalent in the locations where we, our customers, suppliers or third-party business partners conduct business and as a result, we have experienced moderate disruptions in our global operations. We have experienced and may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand, including due to customer loss of private health insurance coverage for our products, that could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. We currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture components and materials for our devices, and to provide services such as sterilization services and we purchase these materials and services from numerous suppliers worldwide. \n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to have an adverse impact on our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Disruptions relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including shelter-in-place orders in the U.S. and other countries, could prevent employees, suppliers, distributors, and others from accessing manufacturing facilities and from transporting our products or the components required to manufacture our products. For example, we have experienced some supply chain disruption due to the global restrictions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the manufacturing of our next-generation CGM product. Further, worldwide supply chain disruption relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in product shortages that has and may continue to impact our ability to manufacture our devices. As of the filing date of this Annual Report, the extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations or guidance is uncertain. The effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for further discussion of the possible impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In addition, the global supply chain shortages and disruptions are impacting our ability to obtain certain raw materials and components used in our products. We depend on single- or sole-source suppliers to obtain sufficient quantities of these components that are critical to manufacturing our products. Disruptions at these suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture products on time to meet consumer demand. In addition, these supply chain constraints may result in higher costs due to a more competitive supply environment. These conditions may impact our gross margin. ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Estimates ##TABLE_END\n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 &#8220;Organization and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results. Members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates and their disclosure in this Annual Report with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. \n\nPharmacy Rebates \n\nWe estimate provisions for pharmacy rebates based on contractual arrangements, estimates of products sold subject to rebate, known events or trends and channel inventory data. Estimates associated with rebates on products sold through our distributors under pharmacy benefits are the most significant component of our variable consideration estimates and most at risk for material adjustment because of the time delay between the recording of the provision and its ultimate settlement, an interval that generally ranges from 30 to 90 days, but can last up to one year. Due to this time lag, in any given period, our adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate changes of estimates related to prior periods. \n\nHistorically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenue. An increase or decrease of 1% in our estimate of products sold subject to rebate during 2022, holding all other assumptions constant, would increase or decrease revenue by approximately $19.1 million. \n\nFor more information, see Revenue Recognition in Note 1 &#8220;Organization and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory \n\nWe assess the value of our inventory on a quarterly basis and write down those inventories based on quality control testing data, obsolescence, or in excess of our forecasted demand to the lower of their cost or net realizable value. Our estimates of forecasted demand are based upon our analysis and assumptions including, but not limited to, expected product lifecycles, product development plans and historical usage by product. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable, and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. \n\nWe use the asset and liability approach to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as described in Note 1 &#8220;Organization and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Significant judgment is required to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings in applicable tax jurisdictions. We maintain a valuation allowance on our California research and development tax credits and certain foreign intangible assets, as it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n\nWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach as described in Note 1 &#8220;Organization and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions and is based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. \n\nLoss Contingencies \n\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure . Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. We base our judgments on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Any revision of our estimates of potential liability could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results. \n\n##TABLE_START Overview of Financial Results The most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, and operating cash flow. \n\nKey Highlights for fiscal 2022 include the following: \n\nRevenue Gross Profit Operating Income Net Income Operating Cash Flow $2.91 billion $1.88 billion $391.2 million $341.2 million $669.5 million up 19% from 2021 \n\nup 12% from 2021 \n\nup 47% from 2021 \n\nup 57% from 2021 \n\nup 51% from 2021 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe ended fiscal 2022 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities totaling $2.46 billion. \n\n##TABLE_START Business Trends ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to the general impacts of current events on our company as described in the Overview, looking ahead we expect our business could be affected by the following: \n\n&#8226; Increase in the worldwide incidence of people diagnosed with diabetes and costs related to the management and treatment of diabetes. \n\n&#8226; Changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs. \n\n&#8226; Growing demand for digital health technologies by both healthcare providers and consumers to reduce costs. \n\n&#8226; An expected interest in empowering consumers to make better-informed decisions about their own health and new potential options for facilitating prevention, early diagnosis of life-threatening diseases, and management of chronic conditions outside of traditional health care settings. \n\n&#8226; Growing research and interest in the use of CGM technology outside of the ambulatory care setting, including use by hospital systems. \n\n&#8226; Continued product innovation and competition from other CGM device makers. \n\n&#8226; Our ability to scale efficiently with the construction of our production facility in Malaysia. \n\n##TABLE_START Results of Operations ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START Financial Overview ##TABLE_END\n\nFor discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 - 2021 2022 % of Revenue (1) \n\n2021 % of Revenue (1) \n\n$ Change % Change (In millions, except per share amounts) (As Adjusted)* \n\nRevenue $ 2,909.8 100 % $ 2,448.5 100 % $ 461.3 19 % Cost of sales 1,026.7 35 % 768.0 31 % 258.7 34 % Gross profit 1,883.1 64.7 % 1,680.5 68.6 % 202.6 12 % Operating expenses: Research and development 484.2 17 % 517.1 21 % (32.9) (6) % Collaborative research and development fee &#8212; &#8212; % 87.1 4 % (87.1) ** Amortization of intangible assets 7.5 &#8212; % 3.7 &#8212; % 3.8 ** Selling, general and administrative 1,000.2 34 % 806.8 33 % 193.4 24 % Total operating expenses 1,491.9 51 % 1,414.7 58 % 77.2 5 % Operating income 391.2 13 % 265.8 11 % 125.4 47 % Interest expense (18.6) (1) % (18.8) (1) % 0.2 (1) % Loss on extinguishment of debt &#8212; &#8212; % (0.1) &#8212; % 0.1 ** Income from equity investments 0.2 &#8212; % 11.6 &#8212; % (11.4) (98) % Interest and other income (expense), net 18.0 1 % (1.7) &#8212; % 19.7 ** Income before income taxes 390.8 13 % 256.8 10 % 134.0 52 % Income tax expense 49.6 2 % 39.9 2 % 9.7 24 % Net income $ 341.2 12 % $ 216.9 9 % $ 124.3 57 % Basic net income per share $ 0.88 ** $ 0.56 ** $ 0.32 57 % Diluted net income per share $ 0.82 ** $ 0.53 ** $ 0.29 55 % (1) The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding. \n\n* We adjusted our 2021 amounts to reflect the simplified convertible instruments accounting guidance, which we adopted on a full retrospective basis.

Refer to Note 1, &#8220;Organization and Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information. \n\n** Not meaningful \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue \n\nWe expect that revenue we generate from the sales of our products will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We typically experience seasonality, with lower sales in the first quarter of each year compared to the immediately preceding fourth quarter. This seasonal sales pattern relates to U.S. annual insurance deductible resets and unfunded flexible spending accounts. \n\nCost of sales \n\nCost of sales includes direct labor and materials costs related to each product sold or produced, including assembly, test labor and scrap, as well as factory overhead supporting our manufacturing operations. Factory overhead includes facilities, material procurement and control, manufacturing engineering, quality assurance, supervision and management. These costs are primarily salary, fringe benefits, share-based compensation, facility expense, supplies and purchased services. All of our manufacturing costs are included in cost of sales. In addition, amortization of certain licensing related intangibles are also included in cost of sales. \n\nResearch and development \n\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and research expenses related to our continuous glucose monitoring technology, clinical trials, regulatory expenses, quality assurance programs, materials and products for clinical trials. Research and development expenses are primarily related to employee compensation, including salary, fringe benefits, share-based compensation, and temporary employee expenses. We also incur significant expenses to operate our clinical trials including budgeted clinical site compensation and reimbursement, study monitoring and oversight expenses, clinical trial product and associated travel expenses. Our research and development expenses also include fees for design services, contractors and development materials. \n\nAmortization of intangible assets \n\nOur amortization expense primarily relates to acquired technology and intellectual property and other acquired intangible assets. \n\nSelling, general and administrative \n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary, fringe benefits and share-based compensation for our executive, financial, sales, marketing, information technology and administrative functions. Other significant expenses include commissions, marketing and advertising, IT software license costs, insurance, professional fees for our outside legal counsel and independent auditors, litigation expenses, patent application expenses and consulting expenses. \n\nInterest expense \n\nInterest expense is comprised primarily of costs related to our senior convertible notes. \n\nIncome from equity investments \n\nIncome from equity investments is comprised of realized gains from the sale of an equity investment. \n\nInterest and other income (expense), net \n\nInterest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities portfolio and foreign currency transaction gains and losses due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. \n\n##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 \n\nCompared to \n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nRevenue The revenue increase was primarily driven by increased sales volume of our disposable sensors due to the continued growth of our worldwide customer base, partially offset by mix shift and price associated with the evolution of our channel and product strategy. \n\nDisposable sensor and other revenue comprised approximately 87% of total revenue and Reusable Hardware revenue comprised approximately 13% of total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Disposable sensor and other revenue comprised approximately 84% of total revenue and Reusable Hardware revenue comprised approximately 16% of total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. \n\nCost of Sales &#38; Gross Profit Cost of sales and gross profit increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume. \n\nThe decrease in gross profit margin in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by price, product, and channel mix changes and impact of foreign currencies on revenue. \n\nResearch and Development Expense Research and development expense decreased primarily due to $43.0 million in lower third party and consulting fees most notably related to software development for new products and significant enhancements, $19.9 million in lower costs related to set-up and validation costs for new CGM equipment, and $9.7 million in lower clinical trials costs, partially offset by $26.5 million in compensation-related costs due to higher headcount. \n\nWe continue to believe that focused investments in research and development are critical to our future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to our core business strategy. \n\nCollaborative Research and Development Fee Collaborative research and development fees of $87.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 represents expense incurred in the fourth quarter of 2021 associated with a contingent milestone for regulatory approval under the Restated Collaboration Agreement. See Note 2 &#8220;Collaboration with Verily Life Sciences&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to $54.1 million in compensation-related costs most notably due to higher headcount, $26.0 million in advertising and marketing costs due to an increase in worldwide marketing campaigns, $23.0 million in long-lived asset impairment charges, $21.5 million in legal expense related to litigation, $13.0 million in travel and entertainment expenses, and $5.8 million in depreciation expense due to higher property and equipment balances and accelerated depreciation related to business transition activities. \n\nIncome from Equity Investments Income from equity investments of $11.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 consisted solely of realized gains from the sale of an equity investment. \n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net, increased primarily due to $22.1 million in interest income on our short-term marketable securities portfolio, partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains and losses due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. The increase in interest income was primarily related to a significant increase in market interest rates, as well as an increase in the average invested balances during 2022 compared to 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense on pre-tax book income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The income tax expense we recorded for 2022 is primarily attributable to income tax expense from normal, recurring operations offset by excess tax benefits recognized for share-based compensation for employees (net of disallowed executive compensation) and the Verily milestone payment, and generation of research and development tax credits. The income tax expense we recorded for 2021 is primarily attributable to income tax expense from normal, recurring operations offset by excess tax benefits recognized for employee share-based compensation, generation of research and development tax credits, and a one-time tax benefit related to tax law changes. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Overview, Capital Resources, and Capital Requirements ##TABLE_END\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, proceeds from our senior convertible notes issuances, and access to our Credit Facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses, and debt service costs. \n\nWe expect that cash provided by our operations may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions. We have historically invested our cash primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated, investment grade, highly liquid obligations of U.S. government agencies, commercial paper, corporate debt, and money market funds. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity and other market risks. The general condition of the financial markets and the economy may increase those risks and may affect the value and liquidity of investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets. \n\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: \n\n##TABLE_START The evolution of the international expansion of our business and the revenue generated by sales of our approved products and other future products; Our ability to efficiently scale our operations to meet demand for our current and any future products; The success of our research and development efforts; The expenses we incur in manufacturing, developing, selling and marketing our products; The costs, timing and risks of delays of additional regulatory approvals; The costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; The quality levels of our products and services; The emergence of competing or complementary technological developments; The terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; and The third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers; The rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities; The acquisition of businesses, products and technologies and our ability to integrate and manage any acquired businesses, products and technologies. ##TABLE_END\n\nWe expect that existing cash and short-term investments and cash flows from our future operations will generally be sufficient to fund our ongoing core business. As current borrowing sources become due, we may be required to access the capital markets for additional funding. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. In the event that we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market in light of those earning levels. \n\nA substantial portion of our operations are located in the United States, and the majority of our sales since inception have been made in U.S. dollars. We will be exposed to additional foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations when we begin manufacturing in Malaysia and as our business continues to increase in \n\nmarkets outside of the United States. See &#8220;Foreign Currency Exchange Risk&#8221; in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report for more information. \n\nMain Sources of Liquidity \n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities \n\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities totaled $2.46 billion as of December 31, 2022. None of those funds were restricted and $2.29 billion (approximately 93%) of those funds were located in the United States. \n\nCash flow from Operations \n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we had positive cash flows of $669.5 million from operating activities. We anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. \n\nSenior Convertible Notes \n\nWe received net proceeds of $836.6 million in November 2018 from the 2023 Notes offering and net proceeds of $1.19 billion in May 2020 from the 2025 Notes offering. We used $100.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2023 Notes to repurchase a portion of our common stock in 2018. We used $282.6 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2025 Notes to repurchase a portion of our senior convertible notes due 2022, or 2022 Notes. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes offerings for general corporate purposes and capital expenditures, including working capital needs. We may also use the net proceeds to expand our current business through in-licensing or acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses, products or technologies; however, we do not have any significant commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments at this time. \n\nThe 2023 Note Hedge is expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon any conversion of the 2023 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2023 Notes. See Note 5 &#8220;Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for conversion activity related to the 2023 Notes and shares received as the result of exercising a portion of the 2023 Note Hedge as well as for more information about the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the 2023 Note Hedge, and the 2023 Warrants. \n\nRevolving Credit Agreement \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings, $7.3 million in outstanding letters of credit, and a total available balance of $192.7 million under the Amended Credit Agreement. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the Credit Facility. We currently believe that the Credit Facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it. Revolving loans will be available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. See Note 5 &#8220;Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more details on the Revolving Credit Agreement. \n\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements \n\nOur short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of regular operating costs, interest payments related to our senior convertible notes, capital expenditures for the development of our manufacturing facilities and office spaces, and short-term material cash requirements as described below. As of December 31, 2022, we had a working capital ratio of 1.99 and a quick ratio of 1.72, which indicates that our current assets are more than enough to cover our short-term liabilities. We expect to have significant capital expenditures for the next year to drive our strategic initiative of building out our manufacturing facility and equipment in Malaysia and the capacity scale-up in Mesa, Arizona. \n\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, projected cash contributions from our commercial operations, and borrowings under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated seasonal working capital needs, all capital expenditure requirements, material cash requirements as described below, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. \n\nWe may use cash to repurchase Dexcom shares or for strategic initiatives that strengthen our foundation for long-term growth. On July 26, 2022, a duly authorized committee of our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $700.0 million of our outstanding common stock, with a repurchase period ending no later than June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $142.3 million remained available for repurchase pursuant to our share repurchase program. See Note 9 &#8220;Employee Benefit Plans and Stockholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more details. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have outstanding senior convertible notes that will mature in December 2023. We may elect to settle the remaining principal amount outstanding of the 2023 Notes with cash and/ or shares of Dexcom common stock prior to maturity once certain conditions are met. \n\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements \n\nOur long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of interest and principal payments related to our senior convertible notes, capital expenditures for the development of our manufacturing facilities and office spaces, and long-term material cash requirements as described below. As of December 31, 2022, we had a debt-to-assets ratio of 0.37, which indicates that our total assets are more than enough to cover our short-term and long-term debts. As demand grows for our products, we will continue to expand global operations to meet demand through investments in manufacturing and operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements from our main sources of liquidity as described above to support our future operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations beyond the next 12 months. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have outstanding senior convertible notes that will mature in November 2025 for the 2025 Notes. However, the outstanding principal of our senior convertible notes could be converted into cash and/or shares of our common stock prior to maturity once certain conditions are met. See Note 5 &#8220;Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on conversion rights prior to maturity. \n\nMaterial Cash Requirements \n\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into a variety of purchase arrangements including but not limited to, purchase arrangements related to capital expenditures, components used in manufacturing for the United States and Malaysia, and research and development activities. See Purchase Commitments in Note 6 &#8220;Leases and Other Commitments&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. \n\nAs of January 1, 2022, for U.S. tax purposes, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized rather than immediately deducted. As a result, our annual cash tax payments to the United States Treasury have increased in the current year. \n\nWe issued senior convertible notes in November 2018 and May 2020. The aforementioned obligations include both principal and interest for these notes. Although these notes mature in December 2023 and November 2025, they may be converted into cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayment of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayment. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit of $7.3 million for which we cannot forecast with certainty the amount and timing of repayments. See Note 5 &#8220;Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of the terms of our senior convertible notes. \n\nWe are party to various leasing arrangements, primarily for office, manufacturing and warehouse space that expire at various times through December 2030, excluding any renewal options. We also have land leases in Penang, Malaysia for the build-out of our international manufacturing facility lease that expire through 2082. We anticipate incurring significant expenditures related to the build-out of the Malaysia manufacturing facility and equipment in the next two years. See Leases in Note 6 &#8220;Leases and Other Commitments&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. \n\nUnder our Restated Collaboration Agreement with Verily, additional sales-based milestone payments equivalent to 5,154,640 shares of our common stock, calculated based on the $175.0 million initial milestone amount divided by the volume-weighted average trading price during the 15 consecutive days ending on the date of the Restated Collaboration Agreement, may become due and payable by us upon achievement of certain sales-based milestones. All milestones may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock, at our election. If we elect to make these milestone payments in cash, any such cash payment would be equal to the number of shares that would otherwise be issued for the given milestone payment multiplied by the value of our stock on the date the relevant milestone is achieved, adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and the like. We intend to pay these milestones in shares of our common stock and as such we do not expect to have a material cash requirement for this agreement. See Note 2 &#8220;Development and Other Agreements&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of the Collaboration Agreement with Verily. \n\nSee Note 5 &#8220;Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about the terms of the Credit Agreement, our senior convertible notes, the 2023 Note Hedge, and the 2023 Warrants. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nCash Flows \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated. See the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for complete statements of cash flows for these periods. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $2.46 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, which is a decrease of $275.0 million compared to $2.73 billion as of December 31, 2021. \n\nThe primary cash flows during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are described below.

      "text": " ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including money market funds, U.S. Treasury debt and corporate debt securities. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we believe that we have no material exposure to interest rate risk. \n\nMarket Price Sensitive Instruments \n\nIn order to reduce potential equity dilution, in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes we entered into the 2023 Note Hedge which entitles us to purchase shares of our common stock. Upon conversion of the 2023 Notes, the 2023 Note Hedge is expected to reduce the equity dilution if the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the hedge. We also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties of the 2023 Note Hedge entitling them to acquire shares of our common stock. The warrant \n\ntransactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given quarterly or annual measurement period exceeds the strike price of the warrants. See Note 5 &#8220;Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk \n\nA substantial portion of our operations are located in the United States, and the majority of our sales since inception have been made in U.S. dollars. Historically, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expenses, as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as cost of sales and operating expenses. Changes in foreign currencies impact currency translation and had a slightly negative effect on our revenues and gross profit margins. \n\nWe will be exposed to additional foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations when we begin manufacturing in Malaysia and as our business continues to increase in markets outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the Australian Dollar, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, and the Malaysian Ringgit, could adversely affect our financial results, including income and losses as well as assets and liabilities in addition to risks to our revenues, revenue growth rates, and gross profit margins. \n\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar into the U.S. dollar for consolidation using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. We record net gains or losses resulting from the translation of these financial statements and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long-term nature as a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying investment in international subsidiaries. We also record exchange rate fluctuations resulting from the translation of the short-term intercompany balances between domestic entities and our international subsidiaries as foreign currency transaction gains or losses and include them in interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and generally mature in one month. The derivative gains and losses are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. \n\nNotional principal amounts provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of period end, but they do not represent the amount of our exposure to market loss. Estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. We monitor and manage our financial exposures due to exchange rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our financial results. \n\n##TABLE_START "

      "text": " ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nRegulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 require public companies to maintain &#8220;disclosure controls and procedures,&#8221; which are defined to mean a company&#8217;s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and timely communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date for this purpose. \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. \n\nOur management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst &#38; Young LLP an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. \n\nThe certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.01 and 31.02 to this report. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. \n\nLimitation on Effectiveness of Controls \n\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. The design of any control system is based, in part, upon the benefits of the control system relative to its costs. Control systems can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. In addition, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, we cannot guarantee that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of DexCom, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited DexCom, Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, DexCom, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of DexCom, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nSan Diego, California \n\nFebruary 9, 2023 \n\n##TABLE_START "

(the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n##TABLE_START Estimation of variable consideration for revenue recognition Description of the Matter \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company includes an estimate of variable consideration in the calculation of the transaction price at the time of sale. The Company estimates reductions for pharmacy rebates based on contractual arrangements, estimates of products sold subject to rebate, known events or trends and channel inventory data. \n\nAuditing management&#8217;s determination of transaction price including variable consideration involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management&#8217;s estimates. In estimating pharmacy rebates, management applies contracted rates to estimates of products sold subject to rebate, known market events or trends and channel inventory data. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nF-2 \n\n##TABLE_START How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s processes to determine pharmacy rebates, including the underlying assumptions. \n\nOur audit procedures also included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions and the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in management&#8217;s calculations. This included testing contractual rates, management&#8217;s estimates of products sold subject to rebate, and inventory held by third parties at the end of the period, through a combination of underlying data validation by inspection of source documents, agreement to underlying contracts, review for consistency against historical data, and review of trending of inventory held at third parties versus inventory sold into the channel. In addition, we inspected the results of the Company&#8217;s retrospective review analysis of pharmacy rebates claimed and evaluated the estimates made based on historical experience. ##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2000. \n\nSan Diego, California \n\nFebruary 9, 2023 \n\nF-3 \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nDexCom, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions, except par value data) (As Adjusted)* \n\nAssets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 642.3 &#160; $ 1,052.6 &#160; Short-term marketable securities 1,813.9 &#160; 1,678.6 &#160; Accounts receivable, net 713.3 &#160; 514.3 &#160; Inventory 306.7 &#160; 357.3 &#160; Prepaid and other current assets 192.6 &#160; 81.6 &#160; Total current assets 3,668.8 &#160; 3,684.4 &#160; Property and equipment, net 1,055.6 &#160; 801.8 &#160; Operating lease right-of-use assets 80.0 &#160; 88.1 &#160; Goodwill 25.7 &#160; 26.5 &#160; Intangibles, net 173.3 &#160; 31.5 &#160; Deferred tax assets 341.2 &#160; 290.5 &#160; Other assets 47.1 &#160; 10.5 &#160; Total assets $ 5,391.7 &#160; $ 4,933.3 &#160; Liabilities and Stockholders&#8217; Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 901.8 &#160; $ 573.0 &#160; Accrued payroll and related expenses 134.3 &#160; 125.2 &#160; Current portion of long-term senior convertible notes 772.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Short-term operating lease liabilities 20.5 &#160; 20.5 &#160; Deferred revenue 10.1 &#160; 2.1 &#160; Total current liabilities 1,839.3 &#160; 720.8 &#160; Long-term senior convertible notes 1,197.7 &#160; 1,981.8 &#160; Long-term operating lease liabilities 94.6 &#160; 98.6 &#160; Other long-term liabilities 128.3 &#160; 90.0 &#160; Total liabilities 3,259.9 &#160; 2,891.2 &#160; Commitments and contingencies Stockholders&#8217; equity: \n\nPreferred stock, $ 0.001 par value, 5.0 million shares authorized; no shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nCommon stock, $ 0.001 par value, 800.0 million shares authorized; 393.2 million and 386.3 million shares issued and outstanding, respectively, at December 31, 2022; and 391.4 million and 388.0 million shares issued and outstanding, respectively, at December 31, 2021 \n\n0.4 &#160; 0.4 &#160; Additional paid-in capital 2,258.1 &#160; 2,108.7 &#160; Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( 11.6 ) 0.5 &#160; Retained earnings 479.9 &#160; 138.7 &#160; \n\nTreasury stock, at cost; 6.9 million shares at December 31, 2022 and 3.4 million shares at December 31, 2021 \n\n( 595.0 ) ( 206.2 ) Total stockholders&#8217; equity 2,131.8 &#160; 2,042.1 &#160; Total liabilities and stockholders&#8217; equity $ 5,391.7 &#160; $ 4,933.3 &#160; * We adjusted our 2021 amounts to reflect the simplified convertible instruments accounting guidance, which we adopted on a full retrospective basis.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Organization and Business ##TABLE_END\n\nDexCom, Inc. is a medical device company that develops and markets continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, systems for the management of diabetes by patients, caregivers, and clinicians around the world. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;company,&#8221; or &#8220;Dexcom&#8221; refer to DexCom, Inc. and its subsidiaries. \n\n##TABLE_START Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation ##TABLE_END\n\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DexCom, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation. Amortization expense related to intangible assets has been presented separately from selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. \n\nWe determine the functional currencies of our international subsidiaries by reviewing the environment where each subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash. For international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the local currencies, we translate the financial statements into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for each period for revenue, costs and expenses. We include translation-related adjustments in comprehensive income and in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We record gains and losses resulting from transactions with customers and vendors that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and from certain intercompany transactions in interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Stock Split ##TABLE_END\n\nOn June 10, 2022, the Company effected a four -for-one forward stock split of its common stock to shareholders of record as of May 19, 2022. The par value of the common stock remains $ 0.001 per share. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented. \n\n##TABLE_START Use of Estimates ##TABLE_END\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. Areas requiring significant estimates include rebates, excess or obsolete inventories and the valuation of inventory, accruals for litigation contingencies, and the amount of our worldwide tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates. \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Measurements ##TABLE_END\n\nThe authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability&#8217;s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows: \n\nLevel 1&#8212;Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\nLevel 2&#8212;Uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in \n\nF-10 \n\nthe model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. \n\nLevel 3&#8212;Uses unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar valuation techniques and significant judgment or estimation. \n\nWe estimate the fair value of most of our cash equivalents using Level 1 inputs. We estimate the fair value of our marketable equity securities using Level 1 inputs and we estimate the fair value of our marketable debt securities using Level 2 inputs. We carry our marketable securities at fair value. We carry our other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, at cost, which approximates the related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. See Note 3 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for more information. \n\n##TABLE_START Cash and Cash Equivalents ##TABLE_END\n\nWe consider highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. \n\n##TABLE_START Marketable Securities ##TABLE_END\n\nWe have classified our marketable securities with remaining maturity at purchase of more than three months and remaining maturities of one year or less as short-term marketable securities. We have also classified marketable securities with remaining maturities of greater than one year as short-term marketable securities based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of those marketable securities to satisfy the liquidity needs of our current operations. \n\nWe calculate realized gains or losses on our marketable securities using the specific identification method. We carry our marketable debt securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity in our consolidated balance sheets and included in comprehensive income. Interest income and realized gains and losses on marketable debt securities are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. We carry our marketable equity securities at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses reported in income (loss) from equity investments in our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nWe invest in various types of debt securities, including debt securities in government-sponsored entities, corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, supranational securities, and commercial paper. We do not generally intend to sell these investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity. See Note 3 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; and Short-Term Marketable Securities in Note 4 &#8220;Balance Sheet Details&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our marketable securities. \n\n##TABLE_START Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ##TABLE_END\n\nAccounts receivable are generally recorded at the invoiced amount, net of prompt pay discounts, for distributors and at net realizable value for direct customers, which is determined using estimates of claim denials and historical reimbursement experience without regard to aging category. Accounts receivable are not interest bearing. We evaluate the creditworthiness of significant customers based on historical trends, the financial condition of our customers, and external market factors. We generally do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. Uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted and when it is deemed that a customer account is uncollectible. Generally, receivable balances that are more than one year past due are deemed uncollectible. \n\n##TABLE_START Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers ##TABLE_END\n\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and accounts receivable. We limit our exposure to credit risk by placing our cash and investments with a few major financial institutions. We have also established guidelines regarding diversification of our investments and their maturities that are designed to maintain principal and \n\nF-11 \n\nmaximize liquidity. We review these guidelines periodically and modify them to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates and changes in our operations and financial position. \n\nThe following table sets forth the percentages of total revenue or gross accounts receivable for customers that represent 10% or more of the respective amounts for the periods shown: \n\n##TABLE_START Revenue** Gross Accounts Receivable &#160; Twelve Months Ended December 31, As of December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 Customer A 32 &#160; % 28 &#160; % 23 &#160; % 19 &#160; % 16 &#160; % Customer B 11 &#160; % 12 &#160; % 11 &#160; % 10 &#160; % 11 &#160; % Customer C 26 &#160; % 21 &#160; % 18 &#160; % 17 &#160; % 13 &#160; % Customer D 29 &#160; % 18 &#160; % 11 &#160; % 22 &#160; % 13 &#160; % Customer E 10 &#160; % * * * * ##TABLE_END\n\n* Less than 10% \n\n** Total revenue for each customer is net of fees, cash discounts, and rebates directly allocable to that customer. Rebates paid to other entities are excluded; therefore, the combined value may exceed 100%. \n\n##TABLE_START Inventory ##TABLE_END\n\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a part-by-part basis that approximates first in, first out. We capitalize inventory produced in preparation for commercial launches when it becomes probable that the product will receive regulatory approval and that the related costs will be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. A number of factors are considered, including the status of the regulatory application approval process, management&#8217;s judgment of probable future commercial use, and net realizable value. \n\nWe record adjustments to inventory for potential excess or obsolete inventory, as well as inventory that does not pass quality control testing, in order to state inventory at net realizable value. Factors influencing these adjustments include inventories on hand and on order compared to estimated future usage and sales for existing and new products, as well as judgments regarding quality control testing data and assumptions about the likelihood of scrap and obsolescence. Once written down the adjustments are considered permanent and are not reversed until the related inventory is disposed of or sold. \n\nOur products require customized products and components that currently are available from a limited number of sources. We purchase certain components and materials from single sources due to quality considerations, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. \n\nHistorically, our inventory reserves have been adequate to cover our actual losses. However, if actual product life cycles, product quality or market conditions differ from our assumptions, additional inventory adjustments that would increase cost of goods sold could be required. \n\n##TABLE_START Property and Equipment ##TABLE_END\n\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We capitalize additions and improvements and expense maintenance and repairs as incurred. We also capitalize certain costs incurred for the development of enterprise-level business and finance software that we use internally in our operations. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized while costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and to post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. \n\nWe calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are generally three years for computer software and hardware, including internal use software, four to fifteen years for machinery and equipment, and five years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term. Buildings are amortized over the shorter of the ownership of the building or forty years . We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under finance leases in depreciation expense. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and any gain or loss is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nF-12 \n\nWe review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of the asset by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of the asset based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. \n\n##TABLE_START Goodwill ##TABLE_END\n\nWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value. Events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate or operational performance of the business, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. \n\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis at the reporting unit level, which aligns with Dexcom&#8217;s reporting structure and the availability of discrete financial information. We perform the first step of our annual impairment analysis by either comparing a reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value to its carrying amount or doing a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value from the last quantitative assessment to determine if there is potential impairment. We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated the reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its net assets and we do not believe there have been significant changes in the reporting unit&#8217;s operations that would significantly decrease its estimated fair value or significantly increase its net assets. If a quantitative assessment is performed the evaluation includes management estimates of cash flow projections based on internal future projections and/or use of a market approach by looking at market values of comparable companies. Key assumptions for these projections include revenue growth, future gross margin and operating margin growth, and weighted cost of capital and terminal growth rates. The revenue and margin growth are based on increased sales of new and existing products as we maintain investments in research and development. Additional assumed value creators may include increased efficiencies from capital spending. The resulting cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital. Operating mechanisms and requirements to ensure that growth and efficiency assumptions will ultimately be realized are also considered in the evaluation, including the timing and probability of regulatory approvals for our products to be commercialized. We also consider Dexcom&#8217;s market capitalization as a part of our analysis. \n\nIf the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test. In this step we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if we had just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the total amount allocated to the assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nThe change in goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2020 consisted of translation adjustments on our foreign currency denominated goodwill. The change in goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 consisted of goodwill we recorded for acquisitions that were not significant, individually or in the aggregate, and translation adjustments on our foreign currency denominated goodwill. \n\n##TABLE_START Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets ##TABLE_END\n\nIntangible assets are included in intangibles and other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. We amortize intangible assets with a finite life, such as the customer relationships, acquired technology and intellectual property, trademarks and trade name, and other intangibles, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to seven years . We review intangible assets that have finite lives and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of the asset based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. \n\nF-13 \n\nFor transactions other than a business combination, we also capitalize as intangible assets the cost of certain milestones payable by us to collaborative partners and incurred at or after the product has obtained regulatory approval for marketing. The intangible assets associated with these milestones are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying asset. \n\nWe recorded no significant intangible asset impairment charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Income Taxes ##TABLE_END\n\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. The effect of a change in tax rate on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. \n\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under tax law and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. \n\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. \n\nWe file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and income tax returns in various other foreign jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Due to net operating losses incurred on our U.S. Federal returns, our income tax returns from inception to date are subject to examination by taxing authorities. \n\nWe recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters, including unrecognized tax benefits, as a component of income tax expense. \n\nWe recognize income tax expense for basis differences related to global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") as a period cost if and when incurred. GILTI is a category of income that is earned abroad by U.S.-controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) and is subject to special treatment under the U.S. tax code. \n\n##TABLE_START Warranty Accrual ##TABLE_END\n\nEstimated warranty costs associated with a product are recorded at the time revenue is recognized. We estimate future warranty costs by analyzing historical warranty experience for the timing and amount of returned product, and expectations for future warranty activity based on changes and improvements to the product or process that are in place or will be in place in the future. We evaluate these estimates on at least a quarterly basis to determine the continued appropriateness of our assumptions. \n\n##TABLE_START Loss Contingencies ##TABLE_END\n\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from a claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss and disclose it in our financial statements if it is significant. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, we do not record a liability or an expense but we disclose the range of the possible loss. We base our judgments on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Any revision of our estimates of potential liability could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results. \n\nF-14 \n\n##TABLE_START Comprehensive Income ##TABLE_END\n\nComprehensive income consists of two elements, net income and other comprehensive income (loss). We report all components of comprehensive income, including net income, in our financial statements in the period in which they are recognized. Total comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. We report net income and the components of other comprehensive income (loss), including foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of their related tax effect to arrive at total comprehensive income. \n\n##TABLE_START Revenue Recognition ##TABLE_END\n\nWe generate our revenue from the sale of disposable sensors and our reusable transmitter and receiver, collectively referred to as Reusable Hardware. We also refer to Reusable Hardware and disposable sensors in this section as Components. We generally recognize revenue when control is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled. \n\nIn determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which includes identifying performance obligations in the contract, determining whether the performance obligations are separate, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and determining the timing of revenue recognition for separate performance obligations. \n\nContracts and Performance Obligations \n\nWe consider customer purchase orders, which in most cases are governed by agreements with distributors or third-party payors, to be contracts with a customer. For each contract, we consider the obligation to transfer Components to the customer, each of which are distinct, to be separate performance obligations. We also provide free-of-charge software, mobile applications and updates for our Dexcom Share &#174; remote monitoring system. The standalone selling prices of Dexcom Share &#174; are estimated based on an expected cost plus a margin approach. \n\nTransaction Price \n\nTransaction price for the Components reflects the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled. Transaction price is typically based on the contracted rates less an estimate of claim denials and historical reimbursement experience by payor, which include current and future expectations regarding reimbursement rates and payor mix. \n\nVariable Consideration \n\nWe include an estimate of variable consideration in the calculation of the transaction price at the time of sale, when control of the Components transfers to the customer. Variable consideration includes, but is not limited to: rebates, chargebacks, consideration payable to customers such as specialty distributor and wholesaler fees, product returns provision, prompt payment discounts, and various other promotional or incentive arrangements. We classify our provisions related to variable consideration as a reduction of accounts receivable when we are not required to make a payment or as a liability when we are required to make a payment. \n\nEstimates \n\nWe review the adequacy of our estimates for transaction price adjustments and variable consideration at each reporting date. If the actual amounts of consideration we receive differ from our estimates, we would adjust our estimates and that would affect reported revenue in the period that such variances become known. If any of these judgments were to change, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period. \n\nRebates \n\nWe are subject to rebates on pricing programs with managed care organizations, such as pharmacy benefit managers, governmental and third-party commercial payors, primarily in the U.S. We estimate provisions for rebates based on contractual arrangements, estimates of products sold subject to rebate, known events or trends and channel inventory data. \n\nF-15 \n\nChargebacks \n\nWe participate in chargeback programs, primarily with government entities in the U.S., under which pricing on products below negotiated list prices is provided to participating entities and equal to the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower negotiated price. We estimate provisions for chargebacks primarily based on historical experience on a product and program basis, current contract prices under the chargeback programs and channel inventory data. \n\nConsideration Payable to the Customer \n\nWe pay administrative and service fees to certain of our distributors based on a fixed percentage of the product price. These fees are not in exchange for a distinct good or service and therefore are recognized as a reduction of the transaction price. We accrue for these fees based on actual net sales and contractual fee rates negotiated with the customer. \n\nProduct Returns \n\nIn accordance with the terms of their distribution agreements, most distributors do not have rights of return. The distributors typically have a limited time frame to notify us of any missing, damaged, defective or non-conforming products. We generally provide a &#8220; 30 -day money back guarantee&#8221; program whereby first-time end-user customers may return Reusable Hardware. We estimate our product returns provision principally based on historical experience by applying a historical return rate to the amounts of revenue estimated to be subject to returns. Additionally, we consider other specific factors such as estimated shelf life of inventory in the distribution channel and changes to customer terms. \n\nPrompt Payment Discounts \n\nWe provide customers with prompt payment discounts which may result in adjustments to the price that is invoiced for the product transferred, in the case that payments are made within a defined period. We estimate prompt payment discount accruals based on actual net sales and contractual discount rates. \n\nVarious Other Promotional or Incentive Arrangements \n\nOther promotional or incentive arrangements are periodically offered to customers, including but not limited to co-payment assistance we provide to patients with commercial insurance, promotional programs related to the launch of products or other targeted promotions. We record a provision for the incentive earned based on the number of estimated claims and our estimate of the cost per claim related to product sales that we have recognized as revenue. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe record revenue from sales of Components upon transfer of control of the product to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer. \n\nIn cases where our free-of-charge software, mobile applications and updates are deemed to be separate performance obligations, revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the estimated life of the related Reusable Hardware component. \n\nOur sales of Components include an assurance-type warranty. \n\nContract Balances \n\nContract balances represent amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheets when either we have transferred goods or services to the customer or the customer has paid consideration to us under the contract. These contract balances include accounts receivable and deferred revenue. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 90 days. \n\nAccounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 included unbilled accounts receivable of $ 9.0 million. We expect to invoice and collect all unbilled accounts receivable within twelve months. \n\nWe record deferred revenue when we have entered into a contract with a customer and cash payments are received or due prior to transfer of control or satisfaction of the related performance obligation. \n\nOur performance obligations are generally satisfied within twelve months of the initial contract date. The deferred revenue balances related to performance obligations that will be satisfied after twelve months was $ 19.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 16.1 million as of December 31, 2021. These balances are included in other \n\nF-16 \n\nlong-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Revenue recognized in the period from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was not material for the periods presented. \n\nDeferred Cost of Sales \n\nDeferred cost of sales are associated with transactions for which revenue recognition criteria are not met but product has shipped and released from inventory. Deferred cost of sales are included in prepaid and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nIncentive Compensation Costs \n\nWe generally expense incentive compensation associated with our internal sales force when incurred because the amortization period for such costs, if capitalized, would have been one year or less. We record these costs in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Senior Convertible Notes ##TABLE_END\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, which simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments, amends the guidance on derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity&#8217;s own equity, and modifies the guidance on diluted earnings per share calculations. \n\nWe previously followed in Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, 470-20, which required us to separate each of our convertible debt instruments at issuance into two units of accounting, a liability component, based on our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at issuance, and an equity component. Under ASU 2020-06, we now account for each of our convertible debt instruments as a single unit of accounting, a liability, because we concluded that there were no material conversion features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC 815-15 and our convertible debt instruments were not issued at a substantial premium. Since we adopted ASU 2020-06 using the full retrospective approach, we were required to apply the guidance to all convertible debt instruments we had outstanding as of January 1, 2020. \n\nUpon adoption of ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2020, we recognized $ 67.8 million cumulative-effect adjustment to increase retained earnings for the decrease in interest expense and $ 242.3 million decrease in additional paid in capital for the elimination of the equity component. We have updated these financial statements to reflect the cumulative adjustment for the periods presented. We have labeled our prior period financial statements and related notes &#8220;As Adjusted&#8221; to indicate the change required under the new accounting guidance. \n\nBelow is a summary of the changes in our consolidated balance sheets we originally reported as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 under the ASC 470-20 legacy guidance compared to our adjusted consolidated balance sheets under the new ASU 2020-06 guidance we adopted and reflective of our four -for-one forward stock split: \n\n##TABLE_START Consolidated Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2020 (In millions) As Previously Reported ASU 2020-06 Adjustment Stock Split Adjustment As Adjusted Deferred tax assets $ 216.4 &#160;

Our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and research expenses related to our continuous glucose monitoring technology, clinical trials, regulatory expenses, quality assurance programs, materials and products for clinical trials. Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, including salary, fringe benefits, share-based compensation, and temporary employee expenses. We also incur significant expenses to operate our clinical trials that include clinical site reimbursement, clinical trial product, and associated travel expenses. Our research and development expenses also include fees for design services, contractors, and development materials. \n\nOur CGM systems include certain software that we develop. We expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time we capitalize development costs until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. \n\n##TABLE_START Collaboration Agreements ##TABLE_END\n\nWe may enter into agreements with collaboration partners for the development and commercialization of our products. These arrangements may include payments contingent on the occurrence of certain events such as development, regulatory or sales-based milestones. \n\nWhen we account for these agreements, we consider the unique nature, terms and facts and circumstances of each transaction. Below are some example activities and how we account for them: \n\n&#8226; Payments to collaboration partners through issuance of common stock as consideration in an asset acquisition are considered share-based payment to non-employees in exchange for goods within the scope of ASC Topic 718, &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation.&#8221; The amount and the timing of the cost recognition of such milestones in our financial statements is driven by the accounting for the specific type of equity instrument under ASC 718 that aligns with the terms of the agreement, including any performance conditions. \n\n&#8226; The value associated with in-process research and development (&#8220;IPR&#38;D&#8221;) in an asset acquisition incurred prior to regulatory approval is expensed as it does not have an alternative future use and is recorded as research and development expense. \n\n&#8226; The value associated with IPR&#38;D in an asset acquisition incurred at or after regulatory approval is usually capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over the periods in which the related products are expected to contribute to future cash flows. \n\nF-19 \n\n##TABLE_START Advertising Costs ##TABLE_END \n\nWe expense costs to produce advertising as we incur them whereas costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense was $ 133.0 million, $ 126.4 million and $ 76.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_START Leases ##TABLE_END\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in similar economic environments. The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, payments associated with non-lease components, and costs related to leases with terms of less than 12 months are expensed as incurred. \n\n##TABLE_START Share-Based Compensation ##TABLE_END\n\nShare-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which typically equals the vesting period. \n\nWe value time-based restricted stock units or RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance/market-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. We update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved each quarter and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. \n\nIf any of the assumptions used change significantly, share-based compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period. \n\nWe account for forfeitures as they occur by reversing any share-based compensation expense related to awards that will not vest. \n\n##TABLE_START Net Income Per Share ##TABLE_END\n\nBasic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and, when dilutive, potential common share equivalents. \n\nPotentially dilutive common shares consist of shares issuable from restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, warrants, and our senior convertible notes. Potentially dilutive common shares issuable upon vesting of RSUs, PSUs, and exercise of warrants are determined using the average share price for each period under the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive common shares issuable upon conversion of our senior convertible notes are determined using the if-converted method. In periods of net losses, we exclude all potentially dilutive common shares from the computation of the diluted net loss per share for those periods as the effect would be anti-dilutive. \n\nF-20 \n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods shown: \n\n##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions, except per share data) As Adjusted As Adjusted Net income $ 341.2 &#160; $ 216.9 &#160; $ 549.7 &#160; Add back interest expense, net of tax attributable to assumed conversion of senior convertible notes 11.0 &#160; 11.4 &#160; 11.1 &#160; Net income - diluted $ 352.2 &#160; $ 228.3 &#160; $ 560.8 &#160; Net income per common share Basic $ 0.88 &#160; $ 0.56 &#160; $ 1.46 &#160; Diluted $ 0.82 &#160; $ 0.53 &#160; $ 1.33 &#160; Basic weighted average shares outstanding 389.4 &#160; 386.9 &#160; 377.5 &#160; Dilutive potential common stock outstanding: Restricted stock units and performance stock units 1.0 &#160; 2.1 &#160; 4.0 &#160; Warrants 10.2 &#160; 11.5 &#160; 8.4 &#160; Senior convertible notes 26.9 &#160; 28.3 &#160; 30.5 &#160; Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 427.5 &#160; 428.8 &#160; 420.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOutstanding anti-dilutive securities not included in the diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders calculations were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) As Adjusted As Adjusted Restricted stock units 0.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Recent Accounting Guidance ##TABLE_END\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging&#8212;Contracts in Entity&#8217;s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) . This new guidance is intended to reduce the complexity of accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and requires enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments. Entities may adopt ASU 2020-06 using either a partial retrospective or fully retrospective method of transition. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of 2022 using the full retrospective method, reflecting the application of the new standard in each prior reporting period. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This guidance is intended improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The new guidance requires that the acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the adoption date. Any impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements is dependent on when and if we complete future business combinations. \n\nF-21 \n\n##TABLE_START 2. Development and Other Agreements ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Collaboration with Verily Life Sciences ##TABLE_END\n\nOn November 20, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Collaboration and License Agreement with Verily Life Sciences LLC (an Alphabet Company) and Verily Ireland Limited (collectively, &#8220;Verily&#8221;), which we refer to as the Restated Collaboration Agreement. This replaced our original Collaboration and License Agreement with Verily dated August 10, 2015, as amended in October 2016, including the royalty obligations provisions under that original agreement. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, we and Verily have agreed to continue to jointly develop a certain next-generation CGM product, and potentially one or more additional CGM products, for which we will have exclusive commercialization rights. \n\nThe Restated Collaboration Agreement also provides us with an exclusive license to use intellectual property of Verily resulting from the collaboration, and certain Verily patents, in the development, manufacture and commercialization of blood-based or interstitial glucose monitoring products more generally (subject to certain exclusions, which are outside of the CGM field as it is commonly understood). It also provides us with non-exclusive license rights under Verily&#8217;s other intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize those kinds of glucose monitoring products and certain CGM-product companion software functionalities. The Restated Collaboration Agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, launch and commercialize the CGM product(s) that are the subject of the collaboration according to certain timing and other objectives, and provides for one executive sponsor from each of Dexcom and Verily to meet periodically and make decisions related to the collaboration (within a limited scope of authority) by consensus. \n\nIn consideration of Verily&#8217;s performance of its obligations under the joint development plan of the Restated Collaboration Agreement, the licenses granted to us and the amendment of the original agreement, we made upfront, incentive, and the product regulatory approval payments, and will make potential payments for contingent sales-based milestones upon the achievement of certain revenue targets. \n\nWe account for the contingent milestones payable in shares of our common stock as equity instruments within the scope of ASC Topic 718. The product regulatory approval and sales-based milestones are accounted for as performance-based awards that vest when the performance conditions have been achieved and are recognized when the achievement of the respective contingent milestone is deemed probable. The value of the contingent milestones is based on our closing stock price on December 28, 2018, which was $ 29.57 per share. \n\nUpfront and Incentive payments \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we made an initial payment for an upfront fee of $ 250.0 million through the issuance of 7,363,772 shares of our common stock. We recorded a $ 217.7 million charge in our consolidated statements of operations during 2018 relating to the issuance of this common stock because this milestone payment did not meet the capitalization criteria. The value of the charge was based on our closing stock price of $ 29.57 per share on December 28, 2018, the date on which we obtained the necessary regulatory approvals and represents the date the performance- based awards were issued. In 2019, we made a cash incentive payment of $ 3.2 million due to the completion of certain development obligations and we recorded these payments as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nContingent milestones \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined the achievement of the regulatory approval milestone to be probable and recorded an $ 87.1 million research and development charge in our consolidated statements of operations. This charge is associated with IPR&#38;D obtained in an asset acquisition prior to regulatory approval and therefore does not have an alternative future use. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we received regulatory approval and issued 2,945,508 shares of our common stock in connection with our achievement of the related milestone. \n\nIn December 2022, we received FDA approval and determined the achievement of the sales-based milestones to be probable. As such, we capitalized the full value of the sales-based milestones, $ 152.4 million, as an intangible asset. The sales-based milestones are contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets. The value of the sales based milestones is based on: 1) 5,154,640 shares of our common stock, as agreed upon in November 2018 and 2) our closing stock price on December 28, 2018 of $ 29.57 per share. December 28, 2018 is the date on which we obtained the necessary regulatory approvals and represents the date the performance- based awards were issued. The intangible asset will be amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of 64 months through March 2028. The related amortization expense is recognized in Cost of Sales in our consolidated \n\nF-22 \n\nstatements of operations and disclosed in Note 4 &#8220;Intangibles, Net&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nAll milestones may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock, at our election. If we elect to make these milestone payments in cash, any such cash payment would be equal to the number of shares that would otherwise be issued for the given milestone payment multiplied by the value of our stock on the date the relevant milestone is achieved, and adjusted to give effect to any stock splits, dividends, or similar events. We intend to pay the sales-based contingent milestones in shares of our common stock. \n\nThe Restated Collaboration Agreement will continue until December 31, 2028, unless terminated by either party upon uncured material breach of the Restated Collaboration Agreement by the other party. Upon achievement of the first sales-based milestone event and payment of the corresponding milestone fee by us, the term of the Restated Collaboration Agreement will be extended until December 31, 2033, unless terminated by either party upon uncured material breach of the Restated Collaboration Agreement by the other party. \n\n##TABLE_START 3. Fair Value Measurements ##TABLE_END\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \n\nWe estimate the fair value of our Level 1 financial instruments, which are in active markets, using unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments. \n\nWe obtain the fair values for our Level 2 financial instruments, which are not in active markets, from a primary professional pricing source that uses quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments, rather than direct observations of quoted prices in active markets. Fair values obtained from this professional pricing source can also be based on pricing models whereby all significant observable inputs, including maturity dates, issue dates, settlement dates, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issue spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers or other market related data, are observable or can be derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset. We validate the quoted market prices provided by our primary pricing service by comparing the fair values of our Level 2 marketable securities portfolio balance provided by our primary pricing service against the fair values provided by our investment managers. \n\nThe following table summarizes financial assets that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Measurements Using (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Cash equivalents $ 375.9 &#160; $ 44.8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 420.7 &#160; Debt securities, available-for-sale: U.S. government agencies (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 1,530.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,530.7 &#160; Commercial paper &#8212; &#160; 119.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 119.4 &#160; Corporate debt &#8212; &#160; 163.8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 163.8 &#160; Supranationals &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total debt securities, available-for-sale &#8212; &#160; 1,813.9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,813.9 &#160; \n\nOther assets (2) \n\n10.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 10.2 &#160; Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 386.1 &#160; $ 1,858.7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2,244.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes debt obligations issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or U.S. government agencies. \n\n(2) Includes assets which are held pursuant to a deferred compensation plan for senior management, which consist mainly of mutual funds. \n\nF-23 \n\nThe following table summarizes financial assets that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Measurements Using (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Cash equivalents $ 791.4 &#160; $ 40.0 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 831.4 &#160; Debt securities, available-for-sale: U.S. government agencies &#8212; &#160; 1,210.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,210.6 &#160; Commercial paper &#8212; &#160; 189.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 189.7 &#160; Corporate debt &#8212; &#160; 224.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 224.3 &#160; Supranationals &#8212; &#160; 54.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 54.0 &#160; Total debt securities, available-for-sale &#8212; &#160; 1,678.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,678.6 &#160; \n\nOther assets (1) \n\n7.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7.0 &#160; Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 798.4 &#160; $ 1,718.6 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2,517.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes assets which are held pursuant to a deferred compensation plan for senior management, which consist mainly of mutual funds. \n\nThere were no transfers into or out of Level 3 securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nWe hold certain other investments that we do not measure at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying values of these investments are $ 19.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 4.5 million as of December 31, 2021. We include them in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. It is impracticable for us to estimate the fair value of these investments on a recurring basis due to the fact that these entities are privately held and limited information is available. We monitor the information that becomes available from time to time and adjust the carrying values of these investments if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that have a significant effect on the fair values. \n\nFair Value of Senior Convertible Notes \n\nThe fair value, based on trading prices (Level 1 inputs), of our senior convertible notes were as follows as of the dates indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 (In millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 $ 2,136.2 &#160; $ 2,589.6 &#160; Senior Convertible Notes due 2025 1,314.9 &#160; 1,432.9 &#160; Total fair value of outstanding senior convertible notes $ 3,451.1 &#160; $ 4,022.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor more information on the carrying values of our senior convertible notes, see Senior Convertible Notes in Note 5 &#8220;Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nForeign Currency and Derivative Financial Instruments \n\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. Therefore, changes in the fair values of these contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The duration of these contracts is generally one month. The derivative gains and losses are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nF-24 \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $ 62.0 million and $ 40.0 million, respectively. The resulting impact on our consolidated financial statements from currency hedging activities was not significant for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nOur foreign currency exposures vary but are primarily concentrated in the Australian Dollar, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, and the Malaysian Ringgit. We monitor the costs and the impact of foreign currency risks upon our financial results as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes or for activities other than risk management. We do not require and are not required to pledge collateral for these financial instruments and we do not carry any master netting arrangements to mitigate the credit risk. \n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis \n\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance, we measure certain non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These measurements are usually performed using the discounted cash flow method or cost method and Level 3 inputs. These include items such as non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination and non-financial long-lived assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment. In general, non-financial assets, including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, are measured at fair value when there are indicators of impairment and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment is recognized. \n\nDuring the fourth quarter 2022, we vacated a leased building and made it available for sublease, resulting in an impairment of its asset group which consisted primarily of leasehold improvements and right-of-use asset. We recorded $ 23.0 million in impairment losses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. See Note 6 &#8220;Leases&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for more information. There were no significant impairment losses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START 4.

As of December 31, 2021, the estimated market value of our short-term debt securities with contractual maturities up to 12 months and up to 18 months was $ 1.36 billion and $ 320.7 million, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses on sales of our short-term debt securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not significant. \n\nWe periodically review our portfolio of debt securities to determine if any investment is impaired due to credit loss or other potential valuation concerns. For debt securities where the fair value of the investment is less than the amortized cost basis, we have assessed at the individual security level for various quantitative factors including, but not limited to, the nature of the investments, changes in credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations, industry analyst reports, and the severity of impairment. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2022 were primarily due to increases in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities. Accordingly, we have not recorded an allowance for credit losses. We do not intend to sell these investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity. \n\n##TABLE_START Equity Investments ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we had no unrealized gains or losses recognized during the reporting period on equity investments.

Holders of $ 140.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes elected conversion at their option during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. We settled these conversions by issuing 5,649,988 shares of our common stock. \n\n0.75 % Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 \n\nIn November 2018, we completed an offering of $ 850.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior convertible notes with a stated interest rate of 0.75 % and a maturity date of December 1, 2023 (the &#8220;2023 Notes&#8221;). The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers&#8217; discounts and costs directly related to the offering, were approximately $ 836.6 million. The initial conversion rate of the 2023 Notes is 24.3476 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $ 41.07 per share, subject to adjustments. We entered into transactions for a convertible note hedge (the &#8220;2023 Note Hedge&#8221;) and warrants (the &#8220;2023 Warrants&#8221;) concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes may be settled in cash, stock, or a combination thereof, solely at our discretion. We use the if-converted method for assumed conversion of the 2023 Notes to compute the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for diluted earnings per share. \n\nNo principal payments are due on the 2023 Notes prior to maturity. Other than restrictions relating to certain fundamental changes and consolidations, mergers or asset sales and customary anti-dilution adjustments, the indenture relating to the 2023 Notes includes customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the 2023 Notes may be due and payable immediately. \n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, holders of $ 57.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes elected conversion at their option. We settled these conversions by issuing a combination of common stock and treasury stock. We issued 1,403,112 shares to settle the converted 2023 Notes during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, of which 794,588 shares were issued out of treasury stock. We received 967,380 \n\nF-30 \n\nshares of common stock from the exercise of a portion of the 2023 Note Hedge that we purchased concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, as described below. \n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, holders of $ 17.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes elected conversion at their option. We settled these conversions using treasury stock. We issued 425,552 treasury shares to settle the converted 2023 Notes. We received 287,492 shares of common stock from the exercise of a portion of the 2023 Note Hedge that we purchased concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, as described below. \n\nConversion Rights at the Option of the Holders \n\nHolders of the 2023 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at 100 % of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture relating to the notes). We will also be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their 2023 Notes in connection with certain fundamental changes occurring prior to the maturity date or following the delivery by Dexcom of a notice of redemption. \n\nHolders of the 2023 Notes may convert all or a portion of their notes at their option prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2023, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances: \n\n(1) during any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of Dexcom&#8217;s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the applicable conversion price of the 2023 Notes on each such trading day; \n\n(2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Notes for each day of that five -day consecutive trading day period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of Dexcom&#8217;s common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the 2023 Notes on such trading day; \n\n(3) if we call any or all of the 2023 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or \n\n(4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. \n\nOn or after September 1, 2023, until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the 2023 Notes may convert all or a portion of their notes regardless of the foregoing circumstances. \n\nCircumstance (1) listed above occurred during the quarters ended December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022. As a result, the 2023 Notes were convertible at the option of the holder from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. Circumstance (1) listed above also occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and as a result, the 2023 Notes will remain convertible at the option of the holder from January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. See above for a description of conversion activity related to the 2023 Notes. \n\nConversion Rights at Our Option \n\nDexcom did not have a right to redeem the 2023 Notes prior to December 1, 2021. On or after December 1, 2021 and prior to September 1, 2023, Dexcom may redeem for cash all or part of the 2023 Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Dexcom provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. \n\n2023 Note Hedge \n\nIn connection with the offering of the 2023 Notes, in November 2018 we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with two of the initial purchasers of the 2023 Notes (the &#8220;2023 Counterparties&#8221;) entitling us to purchase up to 20.7 million shares of our common stock at an initial price of $ 41.07 per share, each of which is subject to adjustment. The cost of the 2023 Note Hedge was $ 218.9 million and we accounted for it as an equity instrument by recognizing $ 218.9 million in additional paid-in capital during 2018. The 2023 Note Hedge will expire on December 1, 2023. The 2023 Note Hedge is expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon any conversion of the 2023 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of \n\nF-31 \n\nconverted 2023 Notes if the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the 2023 Note Hedge. The strike price of the 2023 Note Hedge initially corresponds to the conversion price of the 2023 Notes and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2023 Note Hedge. An assumed exercise of the 2023 Note Hedge by us is considered anti-dilutive since the effect of the inclusion would always be anti-dilutive with respect to the calculation of diluted earnings per share. See above for a description of conversion activity related to the 2023 Notes and shares received as the result of exercising a portion of the 2023 Note Hedge. \n\n2023 Warrants \n\nIn November 2018, we also sold warrants to the 2023 Counterparties to acquire up to 20.7 million shares of our common stock. The 2023 Warrants require net share settlement and a pro rated number of warrants will expire on each of the 60 scheduled trading days starting on March 1, 2024. We received $ 183.8 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the 2023 Warrants, which we recorded in additional paid-in capital during 2018. The 2023 Warrants could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given measurement period exceeds the strike price of the 2023 Warrants. The strike price of the 2023 Warrants is initially $ 49.60 per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant agreements. We use the treasury share method for assumed conversion of the 2023 Warrants when computing the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share. \n\n0.25 % Senior Convertible Notes due 2025 \n\nIn May 2020, we completed an offering of $ 1.21 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior convertible notes with a stated interest rate of 0.25 % and a maturity date of November 15, 2025 (the &#8220;2025 Notes&#8221;). The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers&#8217; discounts and estimated costs directly related to the offering, were approximately $ 1.19 billion. The initial conversion rate of the 2025 Notes is 6.6620 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $ 150.11 per share, subject to adjustments. The 2025 Notes may be settled in cash, stock, or a combination thereof, solely at our discretion. We use the if-converted method for assumed conversion of the 2025 Notes to compute the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for diluted earnings per share. \n\nNo principal payments are due on the 2025 Notes prior to maturity. Other than restrictions relating to certain fundamental changes and consolidations, mergers or asset sales and customary anti-dilution adjustments, the indenture relating to the 2025 Notes includes customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the 2025 Notes may be due and payable immediately. \n\nConversion Rights at the Option of the Holders \n\nIn the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture related to the 2025 Notes), holders of the 2025 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the 2025 Notes who convert their notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) or following the delivery by Dexcom of a notice of redemption are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. \n\nPrior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2025, holders of the 2025 Notes may convert all or a portion of their notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances: \n\n(1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of Dexcom&#8217;s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the applicable conversion price of the Notes on each such trading day; \n\n(2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each day of that five day consecutive trading day period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of Dexcom&#8217;s common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the Notes on such trading day; \n\n(3) if we call any or all of the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or \n\n(4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. \n\nF-32 \n\nOn or after August 15, 2025, until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the 2025 Notes may convert all or a portion of their notes regardless of the foregoing circumstances. \n\nConversion Rights at Our Option \n\nDexcom may not redeem the 2025 Notes prior to May 20, 2023. On or after May 20, 2023 and prior to August 15, 2025, Dexcom may redeem for cash all or part of the 2025 Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Dexcom provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. \n\n##TABLE_START Revolving Credit Agreement ##TABLE_END\n\nTerms of the Revolving Credit Agreement \n\nIn October 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Amended Credit Agreement\"), which amended and restated the credit agreement we had previously entered into in December 2018 and amended in May 2020 (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;). The Amended Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving credit facility that provides for an available principal amount of $ 200.0 million which can be increased up to $ 500.0 million at our option subject to customary conditions and approval of our lenders (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;). The Amended Credit Agreement will mature on October 13, 2026. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. \n\nInformation related to availability and outstanding borrowings on our Amended Credit Agreement is as follows as of the date indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (In millions) 2022 Available principal amount $ 200.0 &#160; Letters of credit sub-facility 25.0 &#160; Outstanding borrowings &#8212; &#160; Outstanding letters of credit 7.3 &#160; Total available balance $ 192.7 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRevolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at our choice of one of three base rates plus a range of applicable rates that are based on our leverage ratio. The first base rate is the Alternate Base Rate (&#8220;ABR&#8221;) and loans comprising each ABR borrowing shall bear interest at the ABR plus the applicable rate between 0.375 % to 1.000 %. The ABR is the highest of (a) the prime rate last quoted by The Wall Street Journal, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rate plus one half of 1%, and (c) the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBO Rate&#8221;) for a one month interest period plus 1 %. The second base rate is the Term Benchmark rate and loans comprising each Term Benchmark borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Adjusted Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Adjusted Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate, the Adjusted Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, Adjusted Australian Dollar Rate, the Adjusted Bank Bill Benchmark Rate or the Adjusted Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate, as applicable based on the currency denomination borrowed, plus the applicable rate between 1.375 % to 2.000 % . The third base rate is the Daily Simple RepoFunds Rate (&#8220;RFR&#8221;) and loans comprising each Daily Simple RFR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Daily Simple RFR plus the applicable rate between 1.375 % to 2.000 % plus an additional 0.0326 %. We will also pay a commitment fee of between 0.175 % and 0.250 %, payable quarterly in arrears, on the average daily unused amount of the revolving facility based on our leverage ratio. \n\nOur obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Dexcom and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of our domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries but excluding real property and intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit certain indebtedness, liens, investments, transactions with affiliates, dividends and other restricted payments, subordinated indebtedness and amendments to subordinated indebtedness documents, and sale and leaseback transactions of Dexcom or any of its domestic subsidiaries. The \n\nF-33 \n\nAmended Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2022. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we also have a guarantee facility related to our international operations which is collateralized by a $ 10.7 million term deposit that is included in non-current &#8220;Other assets&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets. \n\n##TABLE_START 6. Leases and Other Commitments ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Leases ##TABLE_END\n\nWe lease office, manufacturing and warehouse space facilities under various domestic and international non-cancellable operating and finance lease arrangements. We also have land leases in Penang, Malaysia that expire through 2082 for the build-out of our international manufacturing facility. Our leases, excluding our land leases in Penang, Malaysia, have remaining lease terms of up to eighteen years . Some of the leases include one or more options to extend the leases for up to five years per option. Options to extend or terminate the lease are included in the lease liability if they are reasonably certain of being exercised. Leases are classified as operating or financing at lease commencement. \n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented separately in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease right-of-use assets are included in property and equipment and finance lease liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities were as shown in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Operating Leases Finance Leases 2023 $ 26.6 &#160; $ 7.3 &#160; 2024 25.0 &#160; 6.3 &#160; 2025 23.9 &#160; 5.4 &#160; 2026 23.5 &#160; 5.4 &#160; 2027 18.3 &#160; 5.4 &#160; Thereafter 18.1 &#160; 65.5 &#160; \n\nTotal future lease cost (1) \n\n135.4 &#160; 95.3 &#160; Less: Imputed interest ( 20.3 ) ( 31.5 ) Present value of future payments 115.1 &#160; 63.8 &#160; Less: Current portion ( 20.5 ) ( 4.2 ) Long-term portion $ 94.6 &#160; $ 59.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Total future lease cost excludes $ 0.6 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced . \n\nCertain lease agreements require us to return designated areas of leased space to its original condition upon termination of the lease agreement, for which we record an asset retirement obligation and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. In subsequent periods, the asset retirement obligation is accreted for the change in its present value and the capitalized asset is depreciated, both over the term of the associated lease agreement. Asset retirement obligations of $ 11.1 million and $ 7.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nF-34 \n\nThe components of lease expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 5.6 &#160; $ 4.1 &#160; $ 2.0 &#160; Interest on lease liabilities 3.3 &#160; 3.0 &#160; 1.9 &#160; Operating lease cost 22.6 &#160; 23.3 &#160; 18.4 &#160; Right-of-use asset impairment 6.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Short-term lease cost 3.5 &#160; 2.3 &#160; 1.3 &#160; \n\nVariable lease cost (1) \n\n8.0 &#160; 6.0 &#160; 4.2 &#160; Total lease cost $ 49.3 &#160; $ 38.7 &#160; $ 27.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Variable lease costs are primarily related to common area maintenance charges and property taxes . \n\nAs the result of the Company&#8217;s transition to a flexible working environment, we vacated a building in San Diego during the fourth quarter and made it available for sublease. This resulted in an impairment indicator. We tested the asset group as of November 30, 2022 consisting primarily of the leasehold improvements and right-of-use asset for recoverability by comparing its carrying value to an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows. Based on the results of the recoverability test, we determined that the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group were below its carrying value. \n\nWe determined the fair value of the asset group by discounting the estimated future cash flows using level 3 fair value inputs under ASC 820 as described in Note 1. As a result of the impairment test, we recorded a non-cash charge of $ 23.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 in the &#8220; Selling, general and administrative &#8221; caption of our consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the asset group immediately subsequent to the impairment was $ 2.5 million and was categorized as Level 3 within the ASC 820, &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; fair value hierarchy. \n\nOther information related to our leases is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 26.0 &#160; $ 23.3 &#160; $ 18.3 &#160; Operating cash flows from finance leases 3.1 &#160; 1.9 &#160; 0.7 &#160; Financing cash flows from finance leases 15.5 &#160; 9.9 &#160; 8.5 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities: Operating leases 15.6 &#160; 13.1 &#160; 33.5 &#160; Finance leases $ 16.1 &#160; $ 6.4 &#160; $ 41.7 &#160; Weighted average remaining lease term: Operating leases 5.5 years 5.5 years 6.1 years Finance leases 15.2 years 15.9 years 23.3 years Weighted average discount rate: Operating leases 6.0 &#160; % 5.0 &#160; % 5.0 &#160; % Finance leases 5.1 &#160; % 5.1 &#160; % 5.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nAmortization of operating lease right-of-use asset included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows was $ 16.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, $ 18.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and $ 12.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. \n\nF-35 \n\n##TABLE_START Purchase Commitments ##TABLE_END \n\nWe are party to various purchase arrangements related to our manufacturing and research and development activities.

An ownership change limitation occurred as a result of the stock offering completed in February 2009. The limitation will result in approximately $ 1.7 million of U.S. research and development tax credits that will expire unused, and is therefore, not reflected in the tax credit carryforwards above. In addition, the related deferred tax assets have been removed from the components of our deferred tax assets as summarized in the table below. The tax benefits related to the remaining federal and state net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be further limited or lost if future cumulative changes in ownership exceed 50% within any three-year period. \n\nSignificant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are shown below. Significant judgment is required to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. We review all available positive and negative evidence, including projections of pre-tax book income, earnings history, reliability of forecasting, and reversal of temporary differences. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings in applicable tax jurisdictions. \n\nF-37 \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions) As Adjusted Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 46.4 &#160; $ 53.0 &#160; Capitalized research and development expenses 211.9 &#160; 49.3 &#160; Tax credits 61.1 &#160; 105.5 &#160; Share-based compensation 16.8 &#160; 13.3 &#160; Fixed and intangible assets 34.4 &#160; 26.4 &#160; Accrued liabilities and reserves 105.3 &#160; 105.5 &#160; Collaborative agreement milestone accrual (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 21.9 &#160; Convertible debt 9.3 &#160; 21.6 &#160; Other &#8212; &#160; 0.5 &#160; Total gross deferred tax assets 485.2 &#160; 397.0 &#160; Less: valuation allowance ( 78.7 ) ( 69.9 ) Total net deferred tax assets 406.5 &#160; 327.1 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Fixed assets and acquired intangibles assets ( 69.9 ) ( 42.5 ) Other ( 0.3 ) &#8212; &#160; Total deferred tax liabilities ( 70.2 ) ( 42.5 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 336.3 &#160; $ 284.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) This amount is related to the $ 87.1 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 associated with our Restated Collaboration Agreement with Verily, as discussed in Note 2 &#8220;Development and Other Agreements&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nWe maintain a valuation allowance of $ 78.7 million against our California research and development tax credits and certain foreign intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the valuation allowance increased by $ 8.9 million primarily due to generation of California research and development tax credits. \n\nThe reconciliation between our effective tax rate on income (loss) from continuing operations and the statutory rate is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) As Adjusted As Adjusted U.S. federal statutory tax rate $ 82.1 &#160; $ 53.9 &#160; $ 62.6 &#160; State income tax, net of federal benefit 5.4 &#160; 8.9 &#160; 5.3 &#160; Permanent items 0.6 &#160; 5.2 &#160; 2.6 &#160; Research and development credits ( 23.3 ) ( 28.9 ) ( 24.4 ) Foreign tax credit &#8212; &#160; ( 3.7 ) &#8212; &#160; Foreign rate differential 27.7 &#160; 20.9 &#160; 9.8 &#160; Stock and officers compensation ( 1.2 ) ( 20.4 ) ( 28.7 ) Collaboration agreement milestone share-based payment ( 52.9 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Change in statutory tax rates 1.0 &#160; ( 10.0 ) ( 4.1 ) Other 1.3 &#160; ( 0.4 ) 0.1 &#160; Change in valuation allowance 8.9 &#160; 14.4 &#160; ( 275.0 ) Income taxes at effective rates \n\n$ 49.6 &#160; $ 39.9 &#160; $ ( 251.8 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nF-38 \n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Balance at January 1, 2020 $ 29.5 &#160; Decreases related to prior year tax positions ( 0.9 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 8.0 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2020 36.6 &#160; Increases related to prior year tax positions 0.4 &#160; Increases related to current year tax positions 9.8 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2021 46.8 &#160; Decreases related to prior year tax positions ( 0.9 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 6.1 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 52.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOf the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, $ 32.5 million, $ 29.5 million and $ 23.5 million, respectively, would affect our annual effective tax rate if recognized. Also included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 is $ 0.2 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to other tax accounts, primarily deferred tax assets. \n\nInterest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense and were not material for any period presented. Although the timing and outcome of audit settlements are uncertain, it is unlikely there will be a significant reduction of the uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. \n\nDue to our global business activities, we file income tax returns and are subject to routine compliance audits in numerous jurisdictions, including those material jurisdictions listed in the following table. The U.S. net operating losses generated since 1999 and utilized in recent years are open for examination. The years remaining subject to audit, by major jurisdiction, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Jurisdiction Fiscal Year United States (Federal and state) 1999 - 2022 Germany 2019 - 2022 United Kingdom 2019 - 2022 Canada 2018 - 2022 ##TABLE_END \n\nWe operate under a tax holiday in the Philippines, which is effective through December 31, 2023, and may be extended for another three years if certain additional requirements are satisfied. The tax holiday is conditional upon remaining in good standing, committing no violation of Philippine Economic Zone Authority Rules and Regulations, pertinent circulars and directives. The impact of this tax holiday was immaterial in in 2022, 2021, and 2020. We have been granted a tax holiday by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) in Malaysia, which will not be triggered until we commence operations. The tax incentive had no effect on foreign taxes during 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\nWe have approximately $ 9.1 million of undistributed earnings attributable to operations in our controlled foreign corporations as of December 31, 2022. We assert that any foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability for taxes associated with these undistributed earnings. If we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable. \n\nF-39 \n\n##TABLE_START 9. Employee Benefit Plans and Stockholders&#8217; Equity ##TABLE_END\n\n401(k) Plan \n\nWe have a defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan (the 401(k) Plan) covering substantially all employees in the United States that meet certain age requirements. Employees who participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute up to 90 % of their compensation each year, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, we may elect to match a discretionary percentage of contributions. We match 50 % of contributions up to 5 % of eligible compensation. Total matching contributions were $ 11.1 million, $ 9.9 million and $ 6.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;) \n\nUnder the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2015 ESPP), amended in December 2019, eligible employees may purchase shares of our common stock at semi-annual intervals through periodic payroll deductions during defined Offering Periods. Payroll deductions may not exceed 10 % of the participant&#8217;s cash compensation subject to certain limitations, and the purchase price will be 85 % of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at either the beginning of the applicable Offering Period or the Purchase Date. A total of 6.0 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2015 ESPP. The 2015 ESPP shall continue until the earlier to occur of (a) termination of the 2015 ESPP by our Board of Directors, (b) issuance of all of the shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan, or (c) May 28, 2025. \n\nWe issued 292,552 , 239,240 and 356,776 shares of common stock under the 2015 ESPP during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 2.9 million shares remained available for future issuance under the 2015 ESPP. \n\nEquity Incentive Plans \n\nIn May 2015, we adopted the Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan), which replaced our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and provides for the grant of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, stock bonuses, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units or RSUs, and performance stock units or PSUs to employees, directors or consultants of the Company. On May 30, 2019, our stockholders approved an increase to the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2015 Plan. \n\nWe are authorized to issue up to 39.2 million shares of our common stock under the 2015 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 15.3 million shares remained available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan. We issue new shares of common stock to satisfy RSU and PSU vesting under our employee equity incentive plans. \n\nRSU awards typically vest in annual installments over three or four years and vesting is subject to continued service. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0 % to 200 % of the target award based on the achievement of pre-established performance and market goals. PSUs vest three years from the date of grant, subject to continued employment through that date. \n\nShare Repurchase Program and Treasury Shares \n\nRepurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount. \n\nF-40 \n\nThe following table summarizes our treasury share activity for the periods shown. No treasury share activity occurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Shares issued in connection with 2023 Notes conversions 0.4 &#160; 0.8 &#160; Shares received from Note Hedge ( 0.3 ) ( 1.0 ) Shares issued in connection with the Restated Collaboration Agreement 2.9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program ( 6.6 ) &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOn July 26, 2022, a duly authorized committee of our Board of Directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program of up to $ 700.0 million of our outstanding common stock, with a repurchase period ending no later than June 30, 2023 (the &#8220;Share Repurchase Program&#8221;). Shares of common stock repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program become treasury shares. Repurchases of our common stock under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time, on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other methods, at our discretion, and in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations. \n\nOn August 1, 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (&#8220;ASR&#8221;) agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#8220;JP Morgan&#8221;) to repurchase up to $ 700.0 million of our common stock on an accelerated basis through September 29, 2022. On August 3, 2022, we paid $ 700.0 million to JP Morgan and received an initial delivery of approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock. The final notional amount under the ASR agreement was $ 557.7 million or approximately 6.6 million shares of our common stock based on the daily average volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the ASR for the period from August 1, 2022 to August 31, 2022, less a discount. The ASR agreement concluded on September 1, 2022. \n\nThe ASR was a forward contract indexed to our own common stock. The forward contract met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, so we did not account for it as a derivative instrument. We have reflected the shares delivered to us by the financial institution as treasury shares as of the dates they were delivered to us in computing weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and diluted net income per share. \n\nRepurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of repurchased shares and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares rather than retiring them. Future stock repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program are at the discretion of our management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. \n\nStock Options \n\nWe have not granted any stock options since 2010. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no stock options outstanding. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $ 7.9 million. \n\nEquity Award Activity \n\nAll periods presented have also been adjusted to reflect the four -for-one stock split. Refer to Note 1, &#8220;Organization and Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nF-41 \n\nA summary of RSU and PSU activity under the 2015 Plan for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Nonvested RSU and PSU Activity (In millions, except weighted average grant date fair value) Shares Available for Grant Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Aggregate Intrinsic Value Balance at December 31, 2019 19.6 &#160; 7.2 &#160; $ 24.20 &#160; Granted ( 2.0 ) 2.0 &#160; 75.09 &#160; Vested &#8212; &#160; ( 4.1 ) 23.10 &#160; Forfeited 0.4 &#160; ( 0.4 ) 34.36 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2020 18.0 &#160; 4.7 &#160; 45.88 &#160; $ 430.6 &#160; Granted ( 1.7 ) 1.7 &#160; 87.67 &#160; Vested &#8212; &#160; ( 2.9 ) 34.47 &#160; Forfeited 0.5 &#160; ( 0.5 ) 69.77 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2021 16.8 &#160; 3.0 &#160; 76.88 &#160; 403.8 &#160; Granted ( 1.9 ) 1.9 &#160; 96.79 &#160; Vested &#8212; &#160; ( 1.6 ) 63.90 &#160; Forfeited 0.4 &#160; ( 0.4 ) 92.54 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2022 15.3 &#160; 2.9 &#160; $ 94.08 &#160; $ 325.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total vest-date fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 160.1 million, $ 284.5 million and $ 331.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, 2.6 million unvested RSUs and 0.3 million unvested PSUs were outstanding under the 2015 Plan. \n\nShare-based Compensation \n\nOur share-based compensation expense is associated with RSUs, PSUs, and the 2015 ESPP.

Business Segment and Geographic Information ##TABLE_END\n\nReportable Segments \n\nAn operating segment is identified as a component of a business that has discrete financial information available and for which the chief operating decision maker must decide the level of resource allocation. In addition, the guidance for segment reporting indicates certain quantitative materiality thresholds. None of the components of our business meet the definition of an operating segment. \n\nWe currently consider our operations to be, and manage our business globally within, one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, reviews our business, makes investment and resource allocation decisions, and assesses operating performance. \n\nDisaggregation of Revenue \n\nWe disaggregate revenue by geographic region and by major sales channel. We have determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories achieves the ASC Topic 606 disclosure objectives of depicting how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. \n\nDexcom is domiciled in the United States.
