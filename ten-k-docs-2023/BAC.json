When used in this report, &#8220;Bank of America,&#8221; &#8220;the Corporation,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries or affiliates. As part of our efforts to streamline the Corporation&#8217;s organizational structure and reduce complexity and costs, the Corporation has reduced and intends to continue to reduce the number of its corporate subsidiaries, including through intercompany mergers. \n\nBank of America is one of the world&#8217;s largest financial institutions, serving individual consumers, small- and middle-market businesses, institutional investors, large corporations and governments with a full range of banking, investing, asset management and other financial and risk management products and services. Our principal executive offices are located in the Bank of America Corporate Center, 100 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28255. \n\nBank of America&#8217;s website is www.bankofamerica.com, and the Investor Relations portion of our website is https://investor.bankofamerica.com.

Additional information related to our business segments and the products and services they provide is included in the information set forth on pages 37 through 46 of Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) and Note 23 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCompetition \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit card issuers, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, and e-commerce and other internet-based companies, including merchant banks and companies providing nonbank financial services. We compete with some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product-specific basis. We are increasingly competing with firms offering products solely over the internet and with non-financial companies, including firms utilizing emerging technologies, such as digital assets, rather than, or in addition to, traditional banking products. \n\nCompetition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, the pricing, quality and range of products and services offered, lending limits, the quality and delivery of our technology and our reputation, experience and relationships in relevant markets. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and develop, retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 2 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nHuman Capital Resources \n\nWe strive to make Bank of America a great place to work for our employees. We value our employees and seek to establish and maintain human resource policies that are consistent with our core values and help to realize the power of our people. Our Board and its Compensation and Human Capital Committee provide oversight of our human capital management strategies, programs and practices. The Corporation&#8217;s senior management provides regular briefings on human capital matters to the Board and its Committees to facilitate the Board&#8217;s oversight. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation employed approximately 217,000 and 208,000 employees, of which 79 percent and 80 percent were located in the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, in 2022 and 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s compensation and benefits expense was $36.4 billion and $36.1 billion, or 59 percent and 61 percent, of total noninterest expense. \n\nDiversity and Inclusion \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with oversight from our Board and CEO. The Corporation&#8217;s senior management sets the diversity and inclusion goals, and the Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity &#38; Inclusion Officer partner with our CEO and senior management to drive our diversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives and policies. The Global Diversity and Inclusion Council, which consists of senior executives from every line of business and region, is chaired by our CEO and has been in place for over 20 years. The Council sponsors and supports business, operating unit and regional diversity and inclusion councils to align with enterprise diversity strategies and goals. \n\nOur practices and policies have resulted in strong representation across the Corporation where our broad employee population mirrors the clients and communities we serve. We have a Board and senior management team that are 53 percent and 55 percent racially, ethnically and gender diverse. The following table presents diversity metrics for our global employees who self-identified as women and our U.S.-based employees who self-identified as people of color, including those who self-identified as Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino. These workforce diversity metrics are reported regularly to the senior management team and to the Board. \n\n##TABLE_START Diversity Metrics as of December 31, 2022 Total Employees Top Three Management Levels Managers at All Levels Global employees Women 50 % 42 % 42 % U.S.-based employees People of color 50 26 42 Asian 14 11 14 Black/African American 14 8 10 Hispanic/Latino 19 6 16 ##TABLE_END\n\nWe invest in our talent by offering a range of development programs and resources that allow employees to develop and progress in their careers. We reinforce our commitment to diversity and inclusion by investing internally in our employee networks and by facilitating enterprise-wide learning and conversations about various diversity and inclusion topics and issues. Further, we partner with various external organizations, which focus on advancing diverse talent. We also have practices in place for attracting and retaining diverse talent, including campus recruitment. For example, in 2022, 44 percent of our global campus hires were women and, in the U.S., 59 percent were people of color. \n\nEmployee Engagement and Talent Retention \n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to make the Corporation a great place to work, we have conducted a confidential annual Employee Engagement Survey (Survey) for nearly two decades. The Survey results are reviewed by the Board and senior management and used to assist in reviewing the Corporation&#8217;s human capital strategies, programs and practices. In 2022, 85 percent of the Corporation&#8217;s employees participated in the Survey, and our Employee Engagement Index, an overall measure of employee satisfaction with the Corporation, was 85 percent. Our turnover among employees was 13 percent in 2022 and 12 percent in 2021. \n\nAdditionally, the Corporation provides a variety of resources to help employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including resources to help employees find new opportunities, re-skill and seek leadership positions. The learning and development strategy is grounded in the development of horizontal skills delivered throughout the organization. Senior leaders, managers and teammates are onboarded and build horizontal skills, as well as role-specific skills, to help drive high performance. This approach also helps facilitate internal mobility and promotion of talent to build a bench of qualified managers and leaders. In 2022, more than 30,000 employees found new roles within the Corporation, and we delivered more than 11 million hours of training and development to our teammates through Bank of America Academy. Additionally, our Board oversees CEO and senior management succession planning, which is formally reviewed at least annually. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n3 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFair and Equitable Compensation \n\nThe Corporation is committed to racial and gender pay equity by striving to compensate all of our employees fairly and equitably. We maintain robust policies and practices that reinforce our commitment, including reviews conducted by a third-party consultant with oversight from our Board and senior management. In 2022, our review covered our regional hubs (U.S., U.K., France, Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore) and India and showed that compensation received by women, on average, was greater than 99 percent of that received by men in comparable positions. In the U.S., compensation received by people of color was, on average, greater than 99 percent of that received by teammates who are not people of color in comparable positions. \n\nWe also strive to pay our employees fairly based on market rates for their roles, experience and how they perform. We regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside our industry to help confirm our pay is competitive. In 2021, the Corporation announced it would increase its minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees to $25 per hour by 2025. In June 2022, as a next step, the Corporation increased its hourly minimum wage for U.S. employees to $22 per hour. In addition, in January 2023, for the sixth year since 2017, we announced that we recognized our teammates with Sharing Success compensation awards for their efforts during 2022. Approximately 96 percent of employees globally will receive an award in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nHealth and Wellness &#8211; 2022 Focus \n\nThe Corporation is also committed to supporting employees&#8217; physical, emotional and financial wellness by offering flexible and competitive benefits, including comprehensive health and insurance benefits and wellness resources. During 2022, we continued efforts to support our employees through the ongoing health crisis resulting from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We provided no-cost COVID-19 testing and teammates with incentives for getting the vaccine and booster. We also held on-site flu and COVID-19 vaccine and booster clinics. \n\nWe continued our efforts around providing affordable access to healthcare, including offering no-cost, 24/7 access to virtual general medical and behavioral health resources to help our enrolled U.S. teammates stay healthy, both physically and emotionally. We kept U.S. health insurance premiums unchanged for teammates earning less than $50,000 for the tenth year in a row, and had nominal premium increases for teammates earning from $50,000 up to $100,000 for the sixth year in a row. We provided in-network generic prescription medications at no cost for teammates enrolled in a U.S. bank medical PPO or Consumer Direct plan, along with continuing preventative care medications at no cost for all U.S. medical plans. \n\nWe offer an extensive benefit package and support work-life balance for our teammates, which includes in the U.S., 16 weeks of paid parental leave for both primary and secondary \n\ncaregivers and backup dependent care (50 days of child and adult backup care per year). We doubled the number of no-cost confidential counseling sessions from six to 12 for all employees and family members and now offer 12 globally. \n\nFor more information about our human capital management, see the Corporation&#8217;s website and 2022 Annual Report to shareholders that will be available on the Investor Relations portion of our website in March 2023 (the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K). \n\nGovernment Supervision and Regulation \n\nThe following discussion describes, among other things, elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies, banks and broker-dealers, including specific information about Bank of America. \n\nWe are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities. U.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. \n\nAs a registered financial holding company and BHC, the Corporation is subject to the supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank subsidiaries (the Banks), organized as national banking associations, are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs&#8217; and national banks&#8217; risk governance frameworks. U.S. financial holding companies, and the companies under their control, are permitted to engage in activities considered &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. The Corporation's status as a financial holding company is conditioned upon maintaining certain eligibility requirements for both the Corporation and its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries, including minimum capital ratios, supervisory ratings and, in the case of the depository institutions, at least satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act ratings. Failure to be an eligible financial holding company could result in the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of America's activities, including potential acquisitions. Additionally, we are subject to a significant number of laws, rules and regulations that govern our businesses in the U.S. and in the other jurisdictions in which we operate, including permissible activities, minimum levels of capital and liquidity, compliance risk management, consumer products and sales practices, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption, government sanctions, privacy, data protection and executive compensation, among others. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 4 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased over the past several years, beginning with the response to the 2008 financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. In addition, the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and fines. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act). We cannot assess whether there will be any additional major changes in the regulatory environment and expect that our business will remain subject to continuing and extensive regulation and supervision. \n\nWe are also subject to various other laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our entities, management and ability to make distributions to shareholders. For instance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both U.S. and international regulation, including supervision by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and New York Stock Exchange, among others; our futures commission merchant subsidiaries supporting commodities and derivatives businesses in the U.S. are subject to regulation by and supervision of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), National Futures Association, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and in the case of the Banks, certain banking regulators; our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies; and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). \n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, prudential regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. For example, our financial services entities in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Ireland and France are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the European Central Bank and Central Bank of Ireland, and the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, respectively. \n\nSource of Strength \n\nUnder the Financial Reform Act and Federal Reserve policy, BHCs are expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC, either as a result of default of a bank subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC&#8217;s loss, subject to certain exceptions. \n\nTransactions with Affiliates \n\nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W, the Banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates. In general, U.S. \n\nbanks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving their nonbank affiliates. Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm&#8217;s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness. \n\nDeposit Insurance \n\nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC&#8217;s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category. All insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the DIF. \n\nThe FDIC is required to maintain a statutory minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. of at least 1.35 percent and has established a long-term goal of a two percent DIF ratio. As of the date of this report, the DIF is below the statutory minimum ratio and the FDIC&#8217;s long-term goal. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan that includes an increase in deposit insurance assessments across the industry of two basis points (bps). The FDIC has indicated that it intends to maintain such assessment rates for the foreseeable future. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. For more information regarding deposit insurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 17. \n\nCapital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements \n\nAs a financial holding company, we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity rules issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the OCC and the FDIC. These rules are complex and are evolving as U.S. and international regulatory authorities propose and enact amendments to these rules. The Corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory rules and to support our business activities. These continually evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity, as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation. \n\nFor more information on regulatory capital rules, capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes, see Capital Management on page 49, and Note 16 &#8211; Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated by reference in this Item 1. \n\nDistributions \n\nWe are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions, including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases. For instance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n5 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers and non-capital standards established under the FDICIA. To the extent that the Federal Reserve increases our stress capital buffer (SCB), global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of capital to shareholders, including dividends and common stock repurchases, could decrease. As part of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may impact the level of our SCB. For example, based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, the Corporation&#8217;s SCB increased to 3.4 percent, and the Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge is expected to increase to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024. Additionally, the Federal Reserve could impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock. For example, as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, in the second half of 2020, the Federal Reserve introduced certain limitations to capital distributions for all large banks, including the Corporation, which were removed effective July 1, 2021. \n\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of our Banks are not &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;well-managed,&#8221; we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. Additionally, the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or BHC, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. \n\nFor more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital requirements, see Note 13 &#8211; Shareholders&#8217; Equity and Note 16 &#8211; Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. The rights of the Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries are further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries. \n\nResolution Planning \n\nAs a BHC with greater than $250 billion of assets, the Corporation is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. \n\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC, including the continued operations or solvent wind down of its material entities, pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance. \n\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the BHC&#8217;s plan is not credible, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations. A summary of our plan is available on the Federal Reserve and FDIC websites. \n\nThe FDIC also requires the submission of a resolution plan for Bank of America, National Association, which must describe how the insured depository institution would be resolved under the bank resolution provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. A description of this plan is available on the FDIC&#8217;s website. \n\nWe continue to make substantial progress to enhance our resolvability, which includes continued improvements to our preparedness capabilities to implement our resolution plan, both from a financial and operational standpoint. \n\nAcross international jurisdictions, resolution planning is the responsibility of national resolution authorities (RA). Among those, the jurisdictions with the greatest impact to the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries are the U.K., Ireland and France, where rules have been issued requiring the submission of significant information about locally incorporated subsidiaries as well as the Corporation&#8217;s banking branches located in those jurisdictions that are deemed to be material for resolution planning purposes. As a result of the RA's review of the submitted information, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years that could increase operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries. \n\nFor more information regarding our resolution plan, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Liquidity on page 9. \n\nInsolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority \n\nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may be appointed receiver of an insured depository institution if it is insolvent or in certain other circumstances. In addition, under the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution. In the event of such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. \n\nThe orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, in certain circumstances, the FDIC could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant (e.g., short-term creditors or operating creditors) in lieu of paying other obligations (e.g., long-term creditors) without the need to obtain creditors&#8217; consent or prior court review. The insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a BHC&#8217;s outstanding equity, as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt. \n\nUnder the FDIC&#8217;s &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC could replace a distressed BHC with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original BHC. \n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve requires that BHCs maintain minimum levels of long-term debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a resolution. \n\nFor more information regarding our resolution, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Liquidity on page 9. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 6 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLimitations on Acquisitions \n\nThe Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits a BHC to acquire banks located in states other than its home state without regard to state law, subject to certain conditions, including the condition that the BHC, after and as a result of the acquisition, controls no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state. At June 30, 2022, we held greater than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. \n\nIn addition, the Financial Reform Act restricts acquisitions by a financial institution if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial institution would exceed 10 percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in the U.S. At June 30, 2022, our liabilities did not exceed 10 percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in the U.S. \n\nThe Volcker Rule \n\nThe Volcker Rule prohibits insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions (collectively, banking entities) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options for their own account. The Volcker Rule also imposes limits on banking entities&#8217; investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule provides exemptions for certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government obligations, insurance company activities and organizing and offering hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also clarifies that certain activities are not prohibited, including acting as agent, broker or custodian. A banking entity with significant trading operations, such as the Corporation, is required to maintain a detailed compliance program to comply with the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. \n\nDerivatives \n\nOur derivatives operations are subject to extensive regulation globally. These operations are subject to regulation under the Financial Reform Act, the European Union (EU) Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, analogous U.K. regulatory regimes and similar regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions that regulate or will regulate the derivatives markets in which we operate by, among other things: requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives; enforcing existing or imposing new capital, margin, reporting, registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants; imposing position limits on certain derivatives; and imposing derivatives trading transparency requirements. These regulations are already in effect in many markets in which we operate. \n\nIn addition, many G-20 jurisdictions, including the U.S., U.K., and Japan, have adopted resolution stay regulations to address concerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial contracts in resolution could impede orderly resolution of G-SIBs, and additional jurisdictions are expected to follow suit. In addition, the EU has implemented EU-wide resolution stay requirements. Generally, these resolution stay regulations require amendment of certain financial contracts to provide for contractual recognition of stays of termination rights under \n\nvarious statutory resolution regimes and a stay on the exercise of cross-default rights based on an affiliate&#8217;s entry into insolvency proceedings. Resolution regulations may also require contractual recognition by the counterparty that amounts owed may be written down or converted into equity as part of a bail in. As resolution stay regulations of a particular jurisdiction applicable to us go into effect, we amend impacted financial contracts in compliance with such regulations either as a regulated entity or as a counterparty facing a regulated entity in such jurisdiction. \n\nConsumer Regulations \n\nOur consumer businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by federal and state regulators. Certain federal consumer finance laws to which we are subject, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP), Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act, are enforced by the CFPB. Other federal consumer finance laws, such as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, are enforced by the OCC. \n\nPrivacy and Information Security \n\nWe are subject to many U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures regarding the disclosure, use and protection of the non-public confidential information of our customers and employees. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires us to periodically disclose Bank of America&#8217;s privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties, under certain circumstances. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other laws also require us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to provide the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. Security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. \n\nOther laws and regulations, at the international, federal and state level, impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or contact customers with marketing offers and establish certain rights of consumers in connection with their personal information. For example, California&#8217;s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), provides consumers with the right to know what personal data is being collected, know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom and opt out of the sale of their personal data, among other rights. In addition, in the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the Data Protection Directive and related implementing national laws in its member states. The CCPA's, CPRA's and GDPR&#8217;s impact on the Corporation was assessed and addressed through comprehensive compliance implementation programs.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nThe discussion below addresses our material risk factors of which we are aware. Any risk factor, either by itself or together with other risk factors, could materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. References to third parties may include their upstream and downstream service providers who may also contribute to our risks. Other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see Managing Risk in the MD&#38;A on page 46. For more information about the risks contained in the Risk Factors section, see Item 1. Business on page 2, MD&#38;A on page 26 and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 94. \n\nMarket \n\nWe may be adversely affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic conditions. \n\nGeneral economic, political, social and health conditions in the U.S. and abroad affect financial markets and our business. In particular, global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, changes in gross domestic product (GDP), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, challenging labor market conditions, wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies, a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity, the continued transition from InterBank Offered Rates (IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the impact of volatility of digital assets on the broader market, the growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure, recessionary fears and investor sentiment. Global markets, including energy and commodity markets, may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, military conflict, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our liquidity. Any sudden or prolonged market downturn, as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. High inflation, elevated interest rate levels, supply chain disruptions, and the Russia/Ukraine conflict, including the related energy impact in Europe, have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in additional market volatility and disruptions. \n\nGlobal uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, including changes in target rates, balance sheet management and lending facilities, are beyond our control and difficult to predict, particularly in a high inflation environment. This can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt \n\nsecurities, and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency rates and may also raise government debt levels, adversely affect businesses and household incomes and increase uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. Monetary policy in response to high inflation has led to a significant increase in market interest rates and a flattening and/or inversion of the yield curve. This has resulted in and may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets, further volatility of the U.S. dollar, a widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates and recessionary concerns, and could result in elevated unemployment, which could impact investor risk appetite and our borrowers, potentially increasing delinquency rates. It is also possible that high inflation may limit the scope of monetary support, including cuts to the federal funds rate, in the event of an economic downturn, resulting in a more protracted period of a flat and/or inverted yield curve. \n\nAny future change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest rates would likely result in lower revenue through lower net interest income, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, climate change (including efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely impact U.S. or global economic activity and our customers', our counterparties' and our earnings and operations. Globally, many central banks are simultaneously reducing monetary accommodation through interest rate or balance sheet policy, which has contributed and may continue to contribute to elevated financial and capital market volatility and significant changes to asset values. While higher interest rates have positively impacted our net interest income, higher interest rates have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact deposits, loan demand and funding costs. If the U.S. government&#8217;s debt ceiling limit is not raised, the ramifications could result in market volatility, ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions. This could have a negative and potentially severe impact on the U.S. and world economy and financial and capital markets, including higher interest rates, higher volatility, lower asset values, lower liquidity, downgrades to U.S. debt, and a weakened U.S. dollar. \n\nChanges to international trade and investment policies by the U.S. could negatively impact financial markets. Escalation of tensions between the U.S. and the People&#8217;s Republic of China (China) could lead to further U.S. measures that adversely affect financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation, including through the use of tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury bonds. Any restrictions on the activities of businesses, could also negatively affect financial markets. \n\nThese developments could adversely affect our businesses, customers, securities and derivatives portfolios, including the risk of lower re-investment rates within those portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels, our liquidity and our results of operations. \n\nIncreased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk. \n\nOur liquidity, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates, fluctuations in equity, commodity and futures prices, trading volumes and prices of securitized products, the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 8 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nbusiness factors. These market risks may adversely affect, among other things, the value of our securities, including our on- and off-balance sheet securities, trading assets and other financial instruments, the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, the value of assets under management (AUM), fee income relating to AUM, customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, the volume of client activity in our trading operations, investment banking, underwriting and other capital market fees, which have already been negatively impacted, the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing. The value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates or credit spreads could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. Changes to fiscal policy, including expansion of U.S. federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance, could also affect market interest rates. If interest rates decrease, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, including future revenue and earnings growth. The continued flattening and/or inversion of the yield curve could also negatively impact our results of operations, including revenue and earnings. \n\nOur models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures are subject to inherent limitations. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa. Such changes to the relationship between market parameters may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. Changes in correlation can be exacerbated where market participants use risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists. Where we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, or where the degree of accessible liquidity declines significantly, we may not be able to reduce our positions and risks associated with such holdings, so we may suffer larger than expected losses when adverse price movements take place. This risk can be exacerbated where we hold a position that is large relative to the available liquidity. \n\nIf asset values decline, we may incur losses and negative impacts to capital and liquidity requirements. \n\nWe have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including loans and loan commitments, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, derivative assets and liabilities, debt securities, marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and are subject to valuation and impairment assessments. We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which, for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate. \n\nGains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. Increases in interest rates may result in further decreases in residential mortgage loan originations and could impact the origination of corporate debt. In addition, \n\nincreases in interest rates or changes in spreads may continue to adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as available for sale, may continue to adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and, thus, capital levels. These market moves could also adversely impact our regulatory liquidity requirements. Any decreases in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds of certain assets, and, therefore, could adversely affect net interest income. Changes in interest rates also may impact the value of mortgage service rights retained. \n\nFair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions, and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets (RWA), which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. Values of AUM also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for asset-based management and performance fees. Declines in values of AUM can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets. \n\nLiquidity \n\nIf we are unable to access the capital markets, have prolonged net deposits outflows, or our borrowing costs increase, our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected. \n\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets, illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets, the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements (including as a result of credit concerns for short-term borrowing), changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile, prolonged federal government shutdowns, or changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that impact our funding. Additionally, our liquidity or cost of funds may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort, unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit, slower customer payment rates, restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients, the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds (which could result from attrition driven by customers seeking higher yielding deposits or securities products, customer desire to utilize an alternative financial institution perceived to be safer, changes in customer spending behavior due to inflation, decline in the economy or other drivers resulting in an increased need for cash), increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries, which could result in the inability to transfer liquidity internally and inefficient funding, changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n9 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ndefault by a significant market participant or third party (including clearing agents, custodians, central banks or central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs)). These factors also have the potential to increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our liquidity. \n\nSeveral of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control, such as general market volatility, disruption, shock or stress, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, Federal Reserve policy decisions (including fluctuations in interest rates or Federal Reserve balance sheet composition), negative views or loss of confidence about us or the financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event, changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies, actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. The impact of these potentially sudden events, whether within our control or not, could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments, unforeseen outflows of cash, the need to draw on liquidity facilities, the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding, debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests, the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies and unexpected collateral calls, among other things, the result of which could be increased costs, a liquidity shortfall and/or impact on our liquidity coverage ratio. \n\nOur liquidity and cost of obtaining funding may be directly related to investor behavior, debt market disruption, firm specific concerns or prevailing market conditions, including changes in interest and currency exchange rates, significant fluctuations in equity and futures prices, lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products and our credit spreads. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in mark-to-market or credit valuation adjustment exposures. Changes in our credit spreads are market driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness, including changes in our credit ratings or changes in broader financial market and macroeconomic conditions. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile. We may also experience net interest margin compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits. Concentrations within our funding profile, such as maturities, currencies or counterparties, can reduce our funding efficiency. \n\nReduction in our credit ratings could limit our access to funding or the capital markets, increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements. \n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. Credit ratings may also be important to investors, customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies, which consider a number of financial and non-financial factors, including our franchise, financial strength, performance and prospects, management, governance, risk management practices, capital adequacy, asset quality and operations, among other criteria, as well as factors not under our control, such as regulatory developments, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and changes to the methodologies used to determine our ratings, or ratings generally. \n\nRating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any downgrades could occur. A reduction in our \n\ncredit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, or bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries, were downgraded by one or more levels, we may experience loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing, and/or incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements. Under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, if our or our subsidiaries&#8217; credit ratings are downgraded, the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements. \n\nWhile certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain and depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including the relationship between long-term and short-term credit ratings and the behaviors of customers, investors and counterparties. \n\nBank of America Corporation is a holding company, is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity and may be restricted from transferring funds from subsidiaries. \n\nBank of America Corporation, as the parent company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal, regulatory, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company, which could result in adverse liquidity events. The parent company depends on dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our preferred stock and common stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Any inability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds, pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition. \n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates, minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements and restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions. \n\nAdditional restrictions on related party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Also, regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 10 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBank of America Corporation&#8217;s liquidity and financial condition, and the ability to pay dividends and obligations, could be adversely affected in the event of a resolution. \n\nBank of America Corporation, our parent holding company, is required to periodically submit a plan to the FDIC and Federal Reserve describing its resolution strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure. Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s preferred resolution strategy is a &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy, whereby only the parent holding company would file for bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Certain key operating subsidiaries would be provided with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company. Bank of America Corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries. Pursuant to these arrangements, if Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent, it will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary. This could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including the ability to meet our payment obligations and the ability to return capital to shareholders, including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock. \n\nIf the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly determine that Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s resolution plan is not credible, they could impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. We could also be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and result in the divestiture of assets or restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries. \n\nWhen a G-SIB such as Bank of America Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver to conduct an orderly liquidation, and could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. Additionally, the FDIC could replace Bank of America Corporation with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors. The FDIC&#8217;s &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy. \n\nIf the Corporation is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or the FDIC&#8217;s orderly liquidation authority, third-party creditors of the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims while security holders of Bank of America Corporation could face significant or complete losses. \n\nCredit \n\nEconomic or market disruptions and insufficient credit loss reserves may result in a higher provision for credit losses. \n\nA number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, letters of credit, derivatives, debt securities, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. Deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur credit portfolios may be impacted by U.S. and global macroeconomic and market conditions, events and disruptions, \n\nincluding declines in GDP, consumer spending or property values, asset price corrections, increasing consumer and corporate leverage, increases in corporate bond spreads, government shutdowns, tax changes, rising or elevated unemployment levels, inflation, fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates, as well as the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change, including acute and/or chronic extreme weather events and efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. Significant economic or market stresses and disruptions typically have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets, which could impact the underlying credit quality of our borrowers, counterparties and assets. Property value declines or asset price corrections could increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties defaulting or becoming delinquent in their obligations to us, and could decrease the value of the collateral we hold, which could increase credit losses. Credit risk could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or declining asset prices, including property or collateral values, unrelated to macroeconomic stress. Simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit and/or an increase in a borrower&#8217;s leverage in a weakening economic environment, or otherwise, could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio, should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations. Increased delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our credit portfolios, including consumer credit card, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. \n\nA recessionary environment and/or a rise in unemployment could adversely impact the ability of our consumer and/or commercial borrowers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations and negatively impact our credit portfolio. Consumers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by inflation, resulting in drawdowns of savings or increases in household debt. Higher interest rates, which have increased debt servicing costs for some businesses and households, may adversely impact credit quality, particularly in a recessionary environment. Certain sectors also remain at risk (e.g., commercial real estate office exposure, consumer discretionary industries) as a result of shifts in demand from the pandemic. Globally, conditions of slow growth or recession could further contribute to weaker credit conditions. If the macroeconomic environment worsens, our credit portfolio and allowance for credit losses could be adversely impacted. \n\nWe establish an allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent in our relevant financial assets. The process to determine the allowance for credit losses uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated, including forecasting how borrowers or counterparties may perform in changing economic conditions. The ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations may be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. There is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers or counterparties, which could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. \n\nIf the models, estimates and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties, which are more sensitive \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n11 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ndue to the current uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, prove inaccurate in predicting future events, we may suffer losses in excess of our ECL. In addition, changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of ECL; however, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses, particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly and quickly, or unexpectedly. As circumstances change, we may increase our allowance, which would reduce our earnings. If economic conditions worsen, impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties or underlying collateral, and credit losses are worse than expected, we may increase our provision for credit losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOur concentrations of credit risk could adversely affect our credit losses, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic, financial, public health or business developments. Concentrations of credit risk may reside in a particular industry, geography, product, asset class, counterparty or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry, geographic location, product or asset class, or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses, and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated. \n\nWe execute a high volume of transactions and have significant credit concentrations with respect to the financial services industry, predominantly comprised of broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, CCPs and other institutional clients. Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. Defaults by one or more counterparties, or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses, defaults and related disputes and litigation. \n\nOur credit risk may also be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us, which may occur as a result of events that impact the value of the collateral, such as an asset price correction or fraud. Disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. \n\nWe have concentrations of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate and consumer credit card, and our commercial real estate and asset managers and funds portfolios, which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio. Declining home price valuations and demand where we have large concentrations could result in increased servicing advances and expenses, defaults, delinquencies or credit losses. The impacts of earthquakes, as well as climate change, such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including droughts, floods, wildfires and hurricanes, could negatively impact collateral, the valuations of home or \n\ncommercial real estate or our customers&#8217; ability and/or willingness to pay fees, outstanding loans or afford new products. This could also cause insurability risk and/or increased insurance costs to customers. \n\nEconomic weaknesses, sustained elevated inflation, adverse business conditions, market disruptions, adverse economic or market events, rising interest or capitalization rates, declining asset prices, greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience a decrease in cash flow and higher credit losses in our portfolios or cause us to write down the value of certain assets. We could also experience continued and long-term negative impacts to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that may be permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences resulting from COVID-19 (e.g., commercial real estate exposure) or other industry disruptions. \n\nWe also enter into transactions with sovereign nations, U.S. states and municipalities. Unfavorable economic or political conditions (such as those arising from the Russia/Ukraine conflict), disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, changes in oil prices, social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit and liquidity risk. \n\nLiquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of our positions, increasing concentrations, which could increase RWA and the credit and market risk associated with our positions. \n\nWe may be adversely affected by weaknesses in the U.S. housing market. \n\nU.S. home prices declined and housing demand slowed in the second half of 2022, including in certain markets where we have large concentrations of loans, driven in part by higher mortgage rates, including 30-year fixed-rate mortgages that more than doubled from 2021. This has negatively impacted the demand in some cases and underlying collateral for many of our products. Additionally, our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market, both of which have slowed due to rising interest rates and reduced affordability. A deeper downturn in the condition of the U.S. housing market could result in both significant write-downs of asset values in several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed securities (MBS). If the U.S. housing market were to further weaken, the value of real estate could decline, which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses, negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses. \n\nWe are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values or an unanticipated credit event, including unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa, may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. Certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change to our or our affiliates&#8217; credit ratings, we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 12 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nremedial actions, and we could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks. In some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements. \n\nWe are also a member of various CCPs, which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to those CCPs. In the event that one or more members of a CCP default on their obligations, we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. A CCP may also, at its discretion, modify the margin we are required to post, which could mean unexpected and increased funding costs and exposure to that CCP. As a clearing member, we are exposed to the risk of non-performance by our clients for which we clear transactions, which may not be covered by available collateral. Additionally, default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses. \n\nGeopolitical \n\nWe are subject to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, compliance, legal, regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate. \n\nWe do business throughout the world, including in emerging markets. Economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally, resulting in, among other things, market volatility, reduced market value and economic output. Our liquidity and credit risk could be adversely impacted by, and our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to, risk of loss from financial, social or judicial instability, economic sanctions, changes in government leadership, including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, high inflation, natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, capital controls, currency re-denomination risk from a country exiting the EU or otherwise, currency fluctuations, foreign exchange controls or movements (caused by devaluation or de-pegging), unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation. These risks are especially elevated in emerging markets. \n\nContinued tensions between the U.S. and important trading partners, particularly China, may result in sanctions, further tariff increases or other restrictive actions on cross-border trade, investment, and transfer of information technology that weigh on trade volumes, raise costs for producers, and adversely affect our businesses and revenues, as well as our customers and counterparties, including their credit quality. \n\nSlowing growth, recessionary conditions, market volatility and/or political or civil unrest, global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures and elevated inflation in many countries pose additional challenges, including in the form of volatility in financial markets. Foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar remain an area of uncertainty and potential volatility as the Federal Reserve and other central banks raise interest rates, and depreciation could increase our financial risks with clients that deal in non-U.S. currencies but have U.S. dollar-denominated debt. \n\nWe invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. Furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging markets, are generally smaller, less \n\nliquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets. Risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations, including our U.S. operations. Market and economic disruptions may affect consumer confidence levels and spending, corporate investment and job creation, bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt, economic growth rates and asset values, among other factors. \n\nElevated government debt levels raise the risk of volatility, significant valuation changes, political tensions among EU members regarding fiscal policy or defaults on or devaluation of sovereign debt, which could expose us to substantial losses. Financial markets have been and may continue to be sensitive to government plans to lower taxes or increase spending. \n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments, securities exchanges and regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are less predictable, prone to change and uncertainty and evolving, and it may be difficult to determine the requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Significant resources are spent on understanding and monitoring foreign laws, rules and regulations. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses, changes to our organizational structure and adversely affect our businesses, reputation and results of operations in that market. \n\nWe are also subject to complex and extensive U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules and regulations, which subject us to costs and risks relating to bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, embargo programs and economic sanctions, which can vary by jurisdiction and require implementation of complex operational capabilities and compliance programs. Non-compliance and/or violations could result in an increase in operational and compliance costs, and enforcement actions and civil and criminal penalties against us and individual employees. The increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heighten financial crimes risk. Compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes and legal requirements depends on our ability to improve our processes, controls, surveillance, detection and reporting and analytic capabilities. \n\nIn connection with the U.K.&#8217;s exit from the EU, we are now subject to different laws and regulations, which are expected to diverge further over time, and are subject to the oversight of additional regulatory authorities. As political and regulatory environments evolve, further changes to the legal and regulatory framework under which our subsidiaries provide products and services in the U.K. and in the EU may result in additional compliance costs and have negative tax consequences or an adverse impact on our results of operations. \n\nIn the U.S., the government&#8217;s debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of U.S. government defaults on its debt and/or downgrades to its credit ratings, and prolonged government shutdowns, which could weaken the U.S. dollar, cause market volatility, negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition, including our liquidity. Additionally, changes in fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy, including as a result of labor shortages, wage pressures, supply chain disruptions and higher inflation, could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations, organizational structure and results of operations. Monetary policy has contributed to a significant depreciation of many foreign currencies over the past \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n13 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nyear. Emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to tighter U.S. monetary policy, and many have responded by tightening monetary policy and intervening in foreign exchange markets. Further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve risks creating additional currency volatility and recessionary conditions in a number of non-U.S. markets. \n\nWe are also subject to geopolitical risks, including economic sanctions, acts or threats of international or domestic terrorism, including responses by the U.S. or other governments thereto, increased risk of state-sponsored cyberattacks or campaigns, civil unrest and/or military conflicts, including the escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, which could adversely affect business, market trade and general economic conditions abroad and in the U.S. The Russia/Ukraine conflict has magnified such risks and resulted in regional instability and adversely impacted commodity and other financial markets, as well as economic conditions, especially in Europe where there is significant risk of recession in some countries. The disruption of energy supplies and other goods and sanctions have contributed to inflationary pressures in Europe and other regions, which has resulted in greater monetary tightening by policymakers, and could adversely impact the profitability of businesses and our credit risk. Military escalation resulting in the involvement of neighboring countries and/or North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries or new sanctions could result in additional economic disruptions, financial market volatility, and changes to asset valuations, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nBusiness Operations \n\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties or the financial services industry, could cause disruptions, adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, and cause legal or reputational harm. \n\nOperational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties and the financial services industry infrastructure. Our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems, emerging technologies, data management and internal processes and controls, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. \n\nOur financial, accounting, data processing and transmission, storage, backup and other operating or security systems and infrastructure, or those of third parties, may be ineffective or fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third party&#8217;s control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Prolonged disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services are possible due to computer, telecommunications, network, utility, electronic or physical infrastructure outages, including from abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms, significant unplanned increases in customer transactions, newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware and software, failure of aging infrastructure or manual processes, retired or redundant software and/or hardware, technology project implementation challenges and supply chain disruptions. Operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages could also result from events arising from natural disasters, including acute and chronic weather events, such as wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods, some of which are happening with more frequency and severity, and earthquakes, as well as local or larger scale \n\npolitical or social matters, including civil unrest, terrorist acts and military conflict. \n\nWe continue to have greater reliance on remote access tools and technology and employees&#8217; personal systems (and our third parties&#8217; employees&#8217; personal systems) and increased data utilization and are increasingly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to operate our businesses remotely due to the increased number of employees who work from home and evolving customer preferences, including increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by our businesses. Effective management of our business continuity increasingly depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of such systems. \n\nWe also rely on our employees, representatives and third parties in our day-to-day operations, who may, due to illness, unavailability, human error, misconduct (including errors in judgment, malice, fraudulent or illegal activity), malfeasance or a failure or breach of systems or infrastructure cause disruptions to our organization and expose us to operational losses, regulatory risk and reputational harm. Our and our third parties&#8217; inability to properly introduce, deploy and manage changes to internal financial and governance processes, existing products, services and technology, and new product innovations and technology could also result in additional operational and regulatory risk. \n\nRegardless of the measures we have taken to implement training, procedures, backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, including systemic cyber events that result in system outages and unavailability of part or all of the internet, cloud services and/or the financial services industry infrastructure (including electronic trading platforms and critical banking activities). Our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with our own systems. \n\nAny backup systems may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up. We regularly update the systems we rely on to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations globally. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. \n\nA failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure resulting in disruption to our critical business operations and customer services and/or failure to identify, effectively respond to operational risks in a timely manner, and continue to deliver our services through an operational disruption could expose us to a number of risks, including market abuse, regulatory, market, privacy and liquidity risk, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, and cause legal or reputational harm. \n\nA cyberattack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, result in the misuse or disclosure of information, result in additional costs, damage to our reputation, increase our regulatory and legal risks and cause financial losses. \n\nOur business is highly dependent on the security, controls and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, and those of our customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties, the financial services \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 14 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nindustry and financial data aggregators, with whom we interact, on whom we rely or who have access to our customers' personal or account information. We rely on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, personally identifiable and other information in our and our third parties&#8217; computer and data management systems and networks. \n\nOur cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of, among other things, our prominent size and scale, high-profile brand, geographic footprint and international presence and role in the financial services industry and the broader economy. The proliferation of third-party financial data aggregators and emerging technologies, including our use of automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure. \n\nWe, our employees, customers, regulators and third parties are regularly the target of an increasing number of cyber threats and attacks. Cyber threats and techniques used in cyberattacks are pervasive, sophisticated and difficult to prevent, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code (such as ransomware), social engineering (including phishing, vishing and smishing), denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that could result in disruptions to our businesses and operations, the loss of our funds and/or our clients&#8217; and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction or theft of confidential, proprietary and other information, including intellectual property, of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties. Cyberattacks may be carried out on a worldwide scale and by a growing number of cyber actors, including organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, extremist parties, hostile foreign governments, state-sponsored actors, activists, disgruntled employees and other third parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. \n\nCyber threats and the techniques used in cyberattacks change, develop and evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies, such as advanced forms of AI and quantum computing. Despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity and resilience of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, employee training and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate or detect cyberattacks or information or security breaches and/or develop or implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address or mitigate such attacks or breaches. Internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data. Additionally, the failure of our employees to exercise sound judgment and vigilance when targeted with social engineering cyberattacks may increase our vulnerability. \n\nOur risk and exposure to cyberattacks and security breaches continue to increase due to the acceptance and use of digital banking products and services, including mobile banking products, and reliance on remote access tools and technology, which have increased our reliance on virtual/digital interactions and a larger number of access points to our networks that must be secured. This increased risk of unauthorized access to our networks results in greater amounts of information being available for access. Employees working remotely away from the office (whether on personal or our devices) also represent inherently greater risk than employees working in our offices. Greater demand on our information technology infrastructure and security tools and processes will likely continue. \n\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other \n\nthird parties with whom we do business and the financial services industry, upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely. Other indirect risks relate to providers of products and/or services, financial counterparties, financial data aggregators, financial intermediaries, such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, regulators, providers of critical infrastructure, such as internet access and electrical power, and retailers for whom we process transactions. We are also at additional risk resulting from critical third-party information security and open-source software vulnerabilities. \n\nWe have exposure to cyber threats due to our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, including providers of products and/or services, and regulators, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and system and customer account updates and conversions. Further, any such event may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. Any failure, cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises our systems or data could adversely impact third parties, counterparties and the critical infrastructure of the financial services industry. \n\nDue to increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyberattack or other information or security vulnerability, failure or breach that significantly exposes, degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities or third parties could adversely impact us and increase the risk of operational failure, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. \n\nCyberattacks or security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and take additional time to determine the scope, extent, amount, and type of information compromised, following which the impact and measures to recover and restore to a business-as-usual state may be difficult to assess. We continue to expend significant additional money and resources to modify or enhance our protective measures, investigate and remediate any information security, software or network vulnerabilities or incidents whether specific to us, a third party, the industry or businesses in general, and develop our capabilities to respond and recover. \n\nWhile we have experienced cyberattacks and security breaches, and expect to continue to, we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyberattacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties. There can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cyber threats, including the remediation of critical information security and software vulnerabilities, will be sufficient and/or timely and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future. Successful penetration or circumvention of system security could result in negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, the withdrawal of customer deposits, misappropriation or destruction of our intellectual property, proprietary information or confidential information and/or the confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information of certain parties, such as our employees, customers, providers of products and services, counterparties and other third parties, or damage to their computers or systems. Any future technology failure, cyberattack or breach could adversely affect our ability to conduct day-to-day business activities, effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n15 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nbusinesses, result in fraudulent or unauthorized transactions or cause prolonged computer and network outages resulting in material disruptions to our or our customers&#8217; or other third parties&#8217; network access or critical business operations and customer services, in the U.S. and/or globally. \n\nAny cyberattack or breach, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in significant lost revenue, give rise to losses and claims brought by third parties, litigation exposure, regulatory sanctions, enforcement actions, government fines, penalties or intervention and other negative consequences. The actual or perceived success of a cyberattack on our systems may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business and/or result in the loss of confidence in our security measures. Additionally, our failure to disclose or communicate cyber incidents appropriately to relevant parties could result in regulatory, privacy, operational and reputational risk. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. Cyberattacks or other information or security breaches could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered ineffective. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. \n\nFailure to satisfy our obligations as servicer for residential mortgage securitizations, loans owned by other entities and other related losses could adversely impact our reputation, servicing costs or results of operations. \n\nWe and our legacy companies service mortgage loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which could cause us to lose servicing income. We may also have liability for any failure by us, as a servicer or master servicer, for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties. If any such breach was found to have occurred, it may harm our reputation, increase our servicing costs or losses due to potential indemnification obligations, result in litigation or regulatory action or adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, foreclosures may result in costs, litigation or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation, or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process. We may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure. \n\nChanges in the structure of and relationship among the GSEs could adversely impact our business. \n\nWe rely on the GSEs to guarantee or purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements. During 2022, we sold approximately $4.1 billion of loans to GSEs, primarily Freddie Mac (FHLMC). FHLMC and Fannie Mae (FNMA) are currently in conservatorship, with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) acting as conservator. In 2019, the Treasury Department published a proposal to recapitalize FHLMC and FNMA and remove them from conservatorship and reduce their role in the marketplace. In January 2021, the Treasury Department further amended the agreement that \n\ngoverns the conservatorship of FHLMC and FNMA and delineated the continued objective to remove the GSEs from conservatorship. However, we cannot predict the future prospects of the GSEs, timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship, or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs in the housing market. If the GSEs take a reduced role in the marketplace, including by limiting the mortgage products they offer, we could be required to seek alternative funding sources, retain additional loans on our balance sheet, secure funding through the Federal Home Loan Bank system, or securitize the loans through Private Label Securitization, which could increase our cost of funds related to the origination of new mortgage loans, increase credit risk and/or impact our capacity to originate new mortgage loans. Uncertainty regarding their future and the MBS they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future. These developments could adversely affect our securities portfolios, capital levels, liquidity and results of operations. \n\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses. \n\nOur risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to effectively and consistently identify, measure, monitor, report and control the key types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Additionally, risks may span across multiple key risk types, including climate risk and legal risk. While we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques, including modeling and forecasting, hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses, our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify and measure all risks, including emerging and unknown risks, anticipate the timing and impact of risks, apply effective hedging strategies, make correct assumptions, manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently, identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data and develop risk management models and forecasts to assess and control risk. \n\nOur ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program and develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the Corporation and manage risks associated with third parties, including providers of products and/or services, enable effective risk management and help confirm that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry, the pace of technological changes, accounting and market developments, the failure of employees, representatives and third parties to comply with our policies and Risk Framework and the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have in the past and may in the future result in a heightened level of risk. For example, we have experienced increased operational, reputational and compliance risk as a result of the prior need to rapidly deploy and implement multiple and varying pandemic relief programs, including the processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states, which have resulted in and will continue to result in losses. Our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate, manage, control or mitigate risks could result in additional losses. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 16 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRegulatory, Compliance and Legal \n\nWe are subject to evolving government legislation and regulations and certain settlements, orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time. \n\nWe are subject to evolving and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including increasing and complex regulatory sanctions regimes. These laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, including the products and services we offer, reduce certain fees and rates or make our products and services more expensive for our clients. We are also required to file various financial and non-financial regulatory reports to comply with laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. \n\nWe continue to adjust our business and operations, legal entity structure, disclosure and policies, processes, procedures and controls, including with regard to capital and liquidity management, risk management and data management, to comply with laws, rules and regulations, as well as guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities, including the Department of Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)), Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, Financial Stability Oversight Council, FDIC, Department of Labor, SEC and CFTC in the U.S., foreign regulators, other government authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Further, we could become subject to future laws, rules and regulations beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated in the U.S. or abroad, including policies and rulemaking related to emerging technologies, cybersecurity and data, and climate risk management and ESG governance and reporting, including emissions and sustainability disclosure. The cumulative effect of all of the current and possible future legislation and regulations on our litigation and regulatory exposure, businesses, operations and profitability remains uncertain and necessitates that we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of prospective and proposed laws, rules and regulations in our business planning. If these assumptions prove incorrect, we could be subject to increased regulatory, legal and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm. Also, U.S. and regulatory initiatives abroad may overlap, and non-U.S. regulation and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed U.S. regulations, which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs. \n\nOur regulators&#8217; prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions, and they have assumed an active oversight, inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry. Regulatory focus is not limited to laws, rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry, but includes other significant laws, rules and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions, including those related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and regulatory sanctions. \n\nWe are also subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including the GDPR and CCPA as modified by the CPRA, and a number of additional jurisdictions enacting or considering similar laws, regarding privacy and the disclosure, collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information, including our employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties, the violation of which could result in litigation, regulatory fines, enforcement actions and operational loss. The complexity and risk of \n\ncompliance has been magnified by the collection of employee health and/or other information in response to the pandemic. Additionally, we will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the U.S. and abroad, which could result in additional costs of compliance, litigation, regulatory fines and enforcement actions. There remains complexity and uncertainty, including potential suspension or prohibition, regarding data transfer because of concerns over compliance with laws, rules and regulations for cross-border flows and transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. and other jurisdictions outside of the EEA, resulting from judicial and regulatory guidance. To the extent that a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework leads to a relaxation of applicable legislation and regulations, regardless of transfer mechanism, challenges are expected from consumer advocacy groups. Other jurisdictions, including China, Russia and India, have commenced consultation efforts or enacted new legislation or regulations to establish standards for personal data transfers. If cross-border personal data transfers are suspended or restricted or we are required to implement distinct processes for each jurisdiction&#8217;s standards, this could result in operational disruptions to our businesses, additional costs, increased enforcement activity, new contract negotiations with third parties, and/or modification of such data management. \n\nAs part of their enforcement authority, our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to, among other things, conduct investigations and assess significant civil or criminal monetary fines, penalties or restitution, issue cease and desist orders, initiate injunctive action, apply regulatory sanctions or enter into consent orders. The amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have, in some instances, been substantial and may increase. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions, which could have significant consequences, including reputational harm, loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products. Our response to regulators and other government authorities may be time-consuming, be expensive and divert management attention from our business. The outcome of any matter, which may last years, may be difficult to predict or estimate. \n\nAdditionally, the terms of settlements, orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities have imposed, or could impose, significant operational and compliance costs on us with respect to enhancements to our procedures and controls, losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against our customers, expansion of our risk and control functions within our lines of business, investment in technology and the hiring of significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel. If we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements, orders or agreements to which we are subject, or, more generally, fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities, we could be required to enter into further settlements, orders or agreements and pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses. \n\nImproper actions, behaviors or practices by us, our employees or representatives that are illegal, unethical or contrary to our core values could harm us, our shareholders or customers or damage the integrity of the financial markets, and are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions. The complexity of the regulatory and enforcement regimes in the \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n17 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nU.S., coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide, also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities. \n\nWhile we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, compliance risks will continue to exist, particularly as we anticipate and adapt to new and evolving laws, rules and regulations. We also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk. Future legislative or regulatory actions, and any required changes to our business or operations, or those of third parties upon whom we rely, resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue, impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability, limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, require us to dispose of certain businesses or assets, require us to curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. \n\nWe are subject to risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action. \n\nWe face significant legal risks in our business, with a high volume of claims against us and other financial institutions. The amount of damages, penalties and fines that litigants and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continues to be significant. This includes disputes with consumers, customers and other counterparties. \n\nFinancial institutions, including us, continue to be the subject of claims alleging anti-competitive conduct with respect to various products and markets, including U.S. antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages. As disclosed in Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we also face contractual indemnification and loan-repurchase claims arising from alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the sale of residential mortgages by legacy companies, which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans, or make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties. \n\nU.S. regulators and government agencies regularly pursue enforcement claims against financial institutions including the Corporation for alleged violations of law and customer harm under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, the federal securities laws, the False Claims Act, fair lending laws and regulations (including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act), antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations related to products and services such as overdraft and sales practices, including prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts and practices under the Consumer Financial Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Such claims may carry significant penalties, restitution and, in certain cases, treble damages, and the ultimate resolution of regulatory inquiries, investigations and other proceedings to which we are subject from time-to-time is difficult to predict. \n\nT here is also an increased focus on compliance with U.S. and global laws, rules and regulations related to the collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data, as well as the implementation, \n\nuse and management of emerging technologies, including AI and machine learning. Additionally, misconduct by our employees and representatives, including unethical, fraudulent, improper or illegal conduct, unfair, deceptive, abusive or discriminatory business practices, or violations of policies, procedures, laws, rules or regulations, including conduct that affects compliance with books and records requirements, can result in litigation and/or government investigations and enforcement actions, and cause significant reputational harm. We are also subject to litigation and regulatory and government actions regarding fraud perpetrated against our customers in connection with the use of our products and services and increased scrutiny of sustainability-related policies, goals, targets and disclosure, which could result in litigation, regulatory investigations and actions and reputational harm. \n\nThe global environment of extensive investigations, regulation, regulatory compliance burdens, litigation and regulatory enforcement, combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment, have affected and will likely continue to affect operational and compliance costs and risks, including the limitation or cessation of our ability or feasibility to continue providing certain products and services. Lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in and will likely continue to result in judgments, orders, settlements, penalties and fines adverse to us. Further, we entered into orders with government authorities regarding our participation in implementing government relief measures related to the pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs, including the processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states, and continue to be involved in related litigation which may result in judgments and/or settlements. Litigation and investigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, including liquidity, and results of operations, and/or cause significant reputational harm. \n\nU.S. federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital, total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), long-term debt or liquidity requirements. \n\nWe are subject to U.S. regulatory capital and liquidity rules. These rules, among other things, establish minimum requirements to qualify as a well-capitalized institution. If any of our subsidiary insured depository institutions fail to maintain their status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules, the Federal Reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to well-capitalized status. For the duration of such an agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose restrictions on our activities. If we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities, including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. \n\nCapital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended. It is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including TLAC and long-term debt requirements, change how regulatory capital or RWA is calculated or increase liquidity requirements. Our ability to return capital to our shareholders depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers. To the extent that increases occur in our SCB, G-SIB surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of capital to shareholders, including common stock dividends and common stock repurchases, could decrease. For example, our G-SIB surcharge is expected to increase by 50 bps to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024. The Federal Reserve could \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 18 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nalso limit or prohibit capital actions, such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock, as a result of economic disruptions or events. \n\nAs part of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may impact the level of our SCB, requiring us to hold additional capital. For example, based on CCAR 2022 stress test results, our SCB increased 90 bps to 3.4 percent on October 1, 2022. \n\nA significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our RWA and our leverage exposure, which may increase. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring RWA that have not yet been implemented in the U.S., including a standardized approach for operational risk, revised market risk requirements and constraints on the use of internal models, as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches. It is expected in 2023 that U.S. banking regulators will propose updates to the U.S. capital framework to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. Economic disruptions or events may also cause an increase in our balance sheet, RWA or leverage exposures, increasing required regulatory capital and liquidity amounts. \n\nChanges to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional equity or other securities, reduce the amount of common stock repurchases or dividends, cease or alter certain operations and business activities or hold highly liquid assets, which may adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nChanges in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us. \n\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If assumptions, estimates or judgments were erroneously applied, we could be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements. Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards, including the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact the preparation and reporting of our financial statements, including the application of new or revised standards retrospectively, resulting in revisions to prior-period financial statements. \n\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations. \n\nIt is possible that governmental authorities in the U.S. and/or other countries could further change tax laws in a way that would materially adversely affect us, including changes to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. New guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development could adversely impact how the global profits of multinational enterprises are taxed. Any change in tax laws and regulations or interpretations of current or future tax laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax liabilities and results of operations. U.S. and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments, \n\ninterpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority. This could result in additional tax liabilities and interest, penalties, the reduction of certain tax benefits and/or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded, which could be material. \n\nAdditionally, we have U.K. net deferred tax assets (DTA) which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors, such as prolonged worsening of Europe&#8217;s capital markets or changes in the ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our U.K. net DTA. \n\nReputation \n\nDamage to our reputation could harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects. \n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including actual or perceived activities of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, third parties, clients, counterparties and other representatives, such as fraud, misconduct and unethical behavior (such as employees&#8217; sales practices), adequacy of our responsiveness to fraud claims perpetrated against our customers, effectiveness of our internal controls, litigation or regulatory matters and their outcomes, compensation practices, lending practices, suitability or reasonableness of particular trading or investment strategies, including the reliability of our research and models, and prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions. \n\nOur reputation may also be harmed by actual or perceived failure to deliver the products and standards of service and quality expected by our customers, clients and the community, including the overstatement or mislabeling of the environmental benefits of our products, services or transactions, failure to recognize and address customer complaints, compliance failures, inability to implement or manage emerging technologies, including quantum computing, AI, machine learning and technology change, failure to maintain effective data management, security breaches, cyber incidents, prolonged or repeated system outages, unintended disclosure of personal, proprietary or confidential information, breach of fiduciary obligations and handling of the emergence or continuation of health emergencies or pandemics. For example, we entered into orders with certain government agencies regarding our processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states, and continue to be involved in related litigation, which may result in judgments and/or settlements. Our reputation may also be negatively impacted by our ESG practices and disclosures, and those of our customers and third parties. \n\nActions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation. Also, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media by employees, the media or otherwise, whether or not factually correct, may adversely impact our business prospects or financial results. \n\nWe are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding fair lending activity, UDAAP, electronic funds transfers, know-your-customer requirements, data protection and privacy, including the GDPR, CCPA as modified by the CPRA, cross-border data movement, cybersecurity and other matters, as well as evolving and expansive interpretations of these laws and \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n19 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nregulations. Principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions, and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid. These laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices, or with one another. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession, or in the possession of third parties or financial data aggregators, is mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do not timely or adequately address such information, we may face regulatory, legal and operational risks, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services, or result in litigation or enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nOur actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues, such as operational risks, gives rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. \n\nOther \n\nThe impacts of the pandemic have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect us. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, adversely affected equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial and capital markets, resulted in challenging labor market conditions, and adversely impacted our financial results to varying degrees and in various respects. The future direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on global health and economic conditions and activity remain uncertain, continue to evolve by region, country and state and depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including impacts from the expiration of the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, surges of COVID-19 cases and the spread of more dangerous variants of COVID-19, the availability, usage and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines, changing client preferences and behavior and future public response and government actions, including travel bans and restrictions, and limitations on business. Such evolving impacts of the pandemic could disrupt the U.S. and global economy, including changes in financial and capital markets, and adversely affect our businesses and operations, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition, including from increased allowance for credit losses and noninterest expenses, which are dependent on the pandemic&#8217;s duration and severity. \n\nReforms to and replacement of IBORs and certain other rates or indices may adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThough significant progress has been made in the global financial markets to replace products and contracts referencing London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other IBORs (IBOR Products), the aggregate notional amount of these IBOR \n\nProducts remains material to our business. Risks and challenges associated with the transition from IBORs remain and may result in consequences that cannot be fully anticipated, which expose us to various financial, operational, supervisory, conduct and legal risk. \n\nWhile there has been significant progress in market and client adoption of ARRs, usage of ARRs may vary across or within categories of contracts, products and services, potentially resulting in market fragmentation, decreased trading volumes and liquidity, increased complexity and modeling and operational risks. ARRs have compositions and characteristics that differ from the benchmarks they replace, in some cases they have limited liquidity, and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace. For example, certain ARRs are calculated on a compounded or weighted-average basis and, unlike IBORs, do not reflect bank credit risk and therefore typically require a spread adjustment. There are important differences between the fallbacks, triggers and calculation methodologies being implemented in cash and derivatives markets. Any mismatch between the adoption of ARRs in loans, securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented, and we may experience unanticipated market exposures. Changes resulting from transition to successor or alternative rates may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into, the value of such loans, securities or derivative instruments, the trading market for such products and contracts, and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk. There can be no assurance that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to IBORs that have not already transitioned to ARRs will transition without delay or potential disputes. \n\nAlthough a significant majority of the aggregate notional amount of our remaining IBOR Products maturing after 2022 include or have been amended to include fallbacks to ARRs, the transitioning of certain IBOR Products that do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms require additional efforts to modify their terms. Some outstanding IBOR Products are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification. To address outstanding IBOR Products that are difficult to modify, legislation has been adopted in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions. Litigation, disputes or other action may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of legislation or regulations, including if there is an overlap between laws or regulations in different jurisdictions or from interactions with any FCA-compelled &#8220;synthetic&#8221; LIBOR settings. \n\nSome of our IBOR Products may contain language giving the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion to determine the successor rate (including the applicable spread adjustment) to the existing benchmark. We may face a risk of litigation, disputes or other actions from clients, counterparties, customers, investors or others based on various claims, for example, that we incorrectly interpreted or enforced IBOR-based contract provisions, failed to appropriately communicate the effect that the transition to ARRs will have on existing and future products, treated affected parties unfairly or made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or engaged in anti-competitive behavior or unlawfully manipulated markets or benchmarks. \n\nARR-based products that we develop, launch and/or support, including products using credit sensitive rates, may perform differently to IBOR Products during times of economic stress, \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 20 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nadverse or volatile market conditions and across the credit and economic cycle, which may impact the value, return on and profitability of our ARR-based assets. New financial products linked to ARRs may have additional legal, financial, tax, operational, market, compliance, reputational, competitive or other risks to us, our clients and other market participants. Banking regulators in the U.S. and globally have maintained heightened regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus on financial institution LIBOR transition plans, preparations and readiness, including our use of credit-sensitive rates like the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index and ARR-based term rates, which could result in regulatory action, litigation and/or the need to change the products offered by our businesses. Failure to meet industry-wide IBOR transition milestones and to cease issuance of IBOR Products by relevant cessation dates may, subject to certain regulatory exceptions, result in supervisory enforcement by applicable regulators, increase our cost of, and access to, capital or lead to other consequences. \n\nThe ongoing market transition has altered, and additional developments may further alter, some aspects of our risk profile and risk management strategies, including derivatives and hedging strategies, modeling and analytics, valuation tools, product design and systems, controls, procedures and operational infrastructure. Further changes may increase costs and expose us to potential risks related to regulatory compliance, requirements or inquiries. Among other risks, various IBOR Products transition to ARRs at different times or in different manners, with the result that we may face unexpected interest rate, pricing or other exposures across business or product lines, and we may face operational risks related to planned processes at certain CCPs to convert outstanding USD LIBOR-cleared derivatives to ARR positions. Continuing reforms to market transition and other factors may adversely affect our business, including the ability to serve customers and maintain market share, financial condition or results of operations and could result in reputational harm to us. \n\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry. \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and experience intense competition from local and global financial institutions and new entrants in domestic and foreign markets. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including customer service and convenience, the pricing, quality and range of products and services we offer, lending limits, the quality and delivery of our technology and our reputation, experience and relationships in relevant markets. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services on more attractive terms, including lower fees and higher interest rates on deposits, and lower cost investment strategies, which may impact our ability to effectively compete. The changing regulatory environment may also create competitive disadvantages, including from different regulatory requirements. \n\nEmerging technologies and the growth of e-commerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions, made it easier for non-depository institutions to offer traditional banking products and services and allowed non-traditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services, including electronic securities trading with low or no fees and commissions, marketplace lending, financial data aggregation and payment processing services, including real-time payment platforms. Further, clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky as an \n\nalternative to traditional banking products. Increased competition may reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services and negatively affect our earnings, including by pressuring us to lower pricing or credit standards, requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology, reducing our market share and/or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us. \n\nOur inability to adapt our business strategies, products and services could harm our business. \n\nWe rely on a diversified mix of businesses that deliver a broad range of financial products and services through multiple distribution channels. Our success depends on our and our third-party providers&#8217; of products and services abilities to adapt our business strategies, products and services and their respective features in a timely manner, including available payment processing services and technology to rapidly evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. \n\nThe widespread adoption and rapid evolution of emerging technologies, including analytic capabilities, self-service digital trading platforms and automated trading markets, internet services, and digital assets, such as central bank digital currencies, cryptocurrencies (including stablecoins), tokens and other cryptoassets that utilize distributed ledger technology (DLT), as well as DLT in payment, clearing and settlement processes creates additional risks, could negatively impact our ability to compete and require substantial expenditures to the extent we were to modify or adapt our existing products and services. As such new technologies evolve and mature, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted, including as a result of the introduction of new competitors to the payment ecosystem and increased volatility in deposits and/or significant long-term reduction in deposits (i.e., financial disintermediation). Also, we may not be as timely or successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding, managing or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers. The Corporation&#8217;s, or its third-party providers&#8217;, inability or resistance to timely innovate or adapt its operations, products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could result in service disruptions and harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation. \n\nWe could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if our models fail to properly anticipate and manage risk. \n\nWe use models extensively to forecast losses, project revenue and expenses, assess and control our operations and financial condition, assist in capital planning and measure, forecast and assess capital and liquidity requirements for credit, market, operational and strategic risks. Under our Enterprise Model Risk Policy, Model Risk Management is required to perform model oversight, including independent validation before initial use, ongoing monitoring reviews through outcomes analysis and benchmarking, and periodic revalidation. However, models are subject to inherent limitations from simplifying assumptions, uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes, and emerging risks from applications that rely on AI. \n\nOur models may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior and liquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic events), which could limit \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n21 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ntheir effectiveness and require timely recalibration. The models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators, which may not be representative of the next downturn and would magnify the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. Our models may also be adversely impacted by human error and may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee and review them at regular intervals and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes, they contain erroneous data, assumptions, valuations, formulas or algorithms or our applications running the models do not perform as expected. Regardless of the steps we take to help confirm effective controls, governance, monitoring and testing, and implement new technology and automated processes, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm, including funding or liquidity shortfalls, if models fail to properly anticipate and manage risks. \n\nFailure to properly manage data may result in our inability to manage risk and business needs, errors in our operations, critical reporting and strategic decision-making, inaccurate reporting and non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations. \n\nWe rely on our ability to manage and process data in an accurate, timely and complete manner, including capturing, transporting, aggregating, using, transmitting data externally, and retaining and protecting data appropriately. While we continually update our policies, programs, processes and practices and implement emerging technologies, such as automation, AI and robotics, our data management processes may not be effective and are subject to weaknesses and failures, including human error, data limitations, process delays, system failure or failed controls. Failure to properly manage data effectively in an accurate, timely and complete manner may adversely impact its quality and reliability and our ability to manage current and emerging risk, produce accurate financial and non-financial, regulatory and operational reporting, detect or surveil potential misconduct or non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations, as well as to manage changing business needs, strategic decision-making, resolution strategy and operations. The failure to establish and maintain effective, efficient and controlled data management could adversely impact our ability to develop our products and relationships with our customers, increase regulatory risk and operational losses, and damage our reputation. \n\nOur operations, businesses and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts related to climate change. \n\nClimate change and related environmental sustainability matters present short-term and long-term risks to us. The physical risks include an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels. Such disasters could impact our facilities and employees and disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties, and result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers&#8217; ability to repay outstanding loans, result in rapid deposit outflows or drawdowns of credit facilities, cause supply chain and/or distribution network disruptions, damage collateral or result in the deterioration of the value of collateral or insurance shortfalls. \n\nThere is also increasing risk related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, market pressures, advancements in technology and additional \n\nlegislation, regulatory and legal requirements could alter the scope of our existing businesses, limit our ability to pursue certain business activities and offer certain products and services, amplify credit and market risks, negatively impact asset values and increase expenses, including as a result of legal, compliance and public disclosure costs in the U.S. and globally with potential jurisdictional divergence, strategic planning, required capital expenditures and changes in technology and markets, including supply chain and insurance availability and cost. We have devoted and expect to continue to devote additional resources as a result of our response to climate change. Our climate change strategies, policies, and disclosures, our ability to achieve our climate-related goals, targets and commitments, and/or the environmental or climate impacts attributable to our products, transactions or services will likely result in heightened legal and compliance risk and could result in reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence. Our ability to meet our climate-related goals, targets and commitments, including our goal to achieve certain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets by 2030 and net zero GHG emissions in our financing activities, operations and supply chain before 2050, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as technology advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies and better emissions data reporting, and ongoing engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. \n\nThere are and will continue to be challenges related to capturing, verifying, analyzing and disclosing climate-related data, which includes nonfinancial data and other information that is subject to measurement uncertainties, may not be independently verified, and may result in legal or reputational harm. \n\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees is critical to our success, business prospects and competitive position. \n\nOur performance and competitive position is heavily dependent on the talents, development and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Competition for qualified personnel within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry is intense. \n\nOur competitors include global institutions and institutions subject to different compensation and hiring regulations than those imposed on U.S. institutions and financial institutions. Also, our ability to attract, develop and retain employees could be impacted by changing workforce concerns, expectations, practices and preferences (including remote work), and increasing labor shortages and competition for labor, which could increase labor costs. \n\nIn order to attract and retain qualified personnel, we must provide market-level compensation. As a large financial and banking institution, we are and may become subject to additional limitations on compensation practices by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators around the world, which may or may not affect our competitors. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of our annual incentive compensation paid to many of our employees is long-term equity-based awards based on the value of our common stock, declines in our profitability or outlook could adversely affect the ability to attract and retain employees. If we are unable to continue to attract, develop and retain qualified individuals, our business prospects and competitive position could be adversely affected. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 22 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n"

Throughout the MD&#38;A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary. \n\nExecutive Summary \n\nBusiness Overview \n\nThe Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, &#8220;Bank of America,&#8221; &#8220;the Corporation,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries or affiliates. Our \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 26 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nprincipal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our various bank and nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth &#38; Investment Management (GWIM) , Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation had $3.1 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 217,000 employees. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and more than 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers all major markets in the U.S., and we serve approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 3,900 retail financial centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with approximately 44 million active users, including approximately 35 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business households. Our GWIM businesses, with client balances of $3.4 trillion, provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world. \n\nRecent Developments \n\nCapital Management \n\nOn February 1, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.22 per share, payable on March 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of March 3, 2023. \n\nFor more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 49. \n\nChanges in U.S. Tax Law \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions. The tax changes included the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs, the establishment of a new 15 percent alternative minimum tax (AMT) on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases. For more information, see Financial Highlights &#8211; Income Tax Expense on page 29. \n\nRussia/Ukraine Conflict \n\nDue to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, there has been significant volatility in financial and commodities markets, and multiple jurisdictions have implemented various economic sanctions. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our direct net country exposure to Russia was $443 million and $733 million, primarily consisting of outstanding loans and leases totaling $391 million and $686 million, and our net country exposure to Ukraine was not significant. While the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to Russia is limited, the potential duration, course and impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict remain uncertain and could adversely affect macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, which could negatively impact the Corporation's businesses, results of operations and financial position. For more \n\ninformation on the risks related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, see the Market, Credit and Geopolitical sections in Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 8. \n\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates \n\nAfter December 31, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) ceased publishing British Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen (JPY) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, subject to the continued publication of certain non-representative LIBOR settings based on a modified calculation (i.e., on a &#8220;synthetic&#8221; basis). The remaining USD LIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023, although the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued a consultation seeking views on whether to compel publication of the one-month, three-month and six-month USD LIBOR settings on a &#8220;synthetic&#8221; basis for a short time after June 30, 2023 (i.e., through September 30, 2024). Separately, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021, subject to certain regulatory-approved exceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance). \n\nAs a result, a major transition has been and continues to be in progress in the global financial markets with respect to the replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs). This has been and continues to be a complex process impacting a variety of our businesses and operations. IBORs have historically been used in many of the Corporation&#8217;s products and contracts, including derivatives, consumer and commercial loans, mortgages, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate products and financial instruments. In response, the Corporation established an enterprise-wide IBOR transition program, with active involvement of senior management and regular reports to the Management Risk Committee (MRC) and Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC). The program continues to drive the Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, including updates to its operational models, systems and processes, introduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and program strategy and governance. \n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Corporation transitioned or otherwise addressed IBOR-based products and contracts referencing the rates that ceased or became non-representative after December 31, 2021, including LIBOR-linked commercial loans, LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages, LIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer trading of certain USD LIBOR and other interest rate swaps, and related hedging arrangements. Additionally, in accordance with the USD LIBOR Guidance, the Corporation has ceased entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to limited exceptions, including those consistent with supervisory guidance. \n\nThe Corporation launched capabilities and services to support the issuance of and trading in products indexed to various alternative reference rates (ARRs) and developed employee training programs as well as other internal and external sources of information on the various challenges and opportunities that the replacement of IBORs has presented and continues to present. The Corporation continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n27 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nindividual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to meet regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones, and access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products. \n\nWith respect to the transition of LIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming non-representative as of June 30, 2023, a significant majority of the Corporation&#8217;s notional contractual exposure to such LIBOR settings, of which the significant majority is derivatives contracts, have been remediated (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to ARRs based on market-driven protocols, regulatory guidance and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms), and the Corporation is continuing to remediate the remaining USD LIBOR exposure. For example, during the first half of 2023, certain central counterparties (CCPs) expect to complete processes to convert outstanding USD LIBOR-cleared derivatives to ARR positions. The remaining exposure, a majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial loans and which represents a small minority of outstanding USD LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation, requires active dialogue with clients to modify the contracts. For any residual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have no fallback provisions, the Corporation continues to assess and plans to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, including the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act in the U.S. (as implemented by the Federal Reserve) and &#8220;synthetic&#8221; USD LIBOR (if the FCA compels such publication), to transition such exposure. \n\nWhile there remain risks to the Corporation associated with the transition from IBORs (as discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other on page 20), such risks have been monitored and, where applicable, managed through the Corporation&#8217;s efforts and dedicated operational resources to date. In the Corporation&#8217;s view, the potential likelihood and/or impact of transition-related risks has lessened over time, and the Corporation anticipates it has devoted appropriate resources to remaining transition efforts and will be able to continue to appropriately monitor and manage such risks as the transition process continues. The Corporation expects transition-related risks to further diminish as certain market developments occur prior to June 30, 2023. \n\nThe Corporation has implemented regulatory, tax and accounting changes and continues to monitor current and potential impacts of the transition, including Internal Revenue Service tax regulations and guidance and Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance. In addition, the Corporation has engaged impacted clients in connection with the transition by providing education on ARRs and the timing of transition events. The Corporation is also working actively with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations. \n\nFor more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other on page 20. \n\nFinancial Highlights \n\n##TABLE_START Table 1 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2022 2021 Income statement Net interest income $ 52,462 &#160; $ 42,934 Noninterest income 42,488 &#160; 46,179 Total revenue, net of interest expense 94,950 &#160; 89,113 Provision for credit losses 2,543 &#160; (4,594) Noninterest expense 61,438 &#160; 59,731 Income before income taxes 30,969 &#160; 33,976 Income tax expense 3,441 &#160; 1,998 Net income 27,528 &#160; 31,978 Preferred stock dividends and other 1,513 &#160; 1,421 Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 26,015 &#160; $ 30,557 Per common share information &#160; &#160; Earnings $ 3.21 &#160; $ 3.60 Diluted earnings 3.19 &#160; 3.57 Dividends paid 0.86 &#160; 0.78 Performance ratios Return on average assets (1) \n\n0.88 &#160; % 1.05 % Return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity (1) \n\n10.75 &#160; 12.23 Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (2) \n\n15.15 &#160; 17.02 Efficiency ratio (1) \n\n64.71 &#160; 67.03 Balance sheet at year end &#160; &#160; Total loans and leases $ 1,045,747 &#160; $ 979,124 Total assets 3,051,375 &#160; 3,169,495 Total deposits 1,930,341 &#160; 2,064,446 Total liabilities 2,778,178 &#160; 2,899,429 Total common shareholders&#8217; equity 244,800 &#160; 245,358 Total shareholders&#8217; equity 273,197 &#160; 270,066 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) For definitions, see Key Metrics on page 167. \n\n(2) Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 85. \n\nNet income was $27.5 billion, or $3.19 per diluted share in 2022 compared to $32.0 billion, or $3.57 per diluted share in 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income. \n\nFor discussion and analysis of our consolidated and business segment results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, see Financial Highlights and Business Segment Operations sections in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nNet Interest Income \n\nNet interest income increased $9.5 billion to $52.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 30 basis points (bps) to 1.96 percent for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization expense, and loan growth, partially offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 32, and for \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 28 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nmore information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 79. \n\nNoninterest Income \n\n##TABLE_START Table 2 Noninterest Income (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 6,083 &#160; $ 6,218 Service charges 6,405 &#160; 7,504 Investment and brokerage services 15,901 &#160; 16,690 Investment banking fees 4,823 &#160; 8,887 Total fees and commissions 33,212 &#160; 39,299 Market making and similar activities 12,075 &#160; 8,691 Other income (2,799) (1,811) Total noninterest income $ 42,488 &#160; $ 46,179 ##TABLE_END\n\nNoninterest income decreased $3.7 billion to $42.5 billion for 2022 compared to 2021. The following highlights the significant changes. \n\n&#9679; Service charges decreased $1.1 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes as well as lower treasury service charges. \n\n&#9679; Investment and brokerage services decreased $789 million primarily driven by lower market valuations and declines in assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by positive AUM flows. \n\n&#9679; Investment banking fees decreased $4.1 billion primarily driven by a decline in demand resulting in lower equity and debt issuance fees and lower advisory fees. \n\n&#9679; Market making and similar activities increased $3.4 billion primarily driven by improved performance across macro products in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing activities in Equities. \n\n&#9679; Other income decreased $988 million primarily due to certain valuation adjustments. \n\nProvision for Credit Losses \n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $7.1 billion to $2.5 billion for 2022 compared to 2021. The provision for credit losses for 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced COVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic) uncertainties. For the same period in the prior year, the benefit in the provision for credit losses was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 73. \n\nNoninterest Expense \n\n##TABLE_START Table 3 Noninterest Expense (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Compensation and benefits $ 36,447 &#160; $ 36,140 Occupancy and equipment 7,071 &#160; 7,138 Information processing and communications 6,279 &#160; 5,769 Product delivery and transaction related 3,653 &#160; 3,881 Marketing 1,825 &#160; 1,939 Professional fees 2,142 &#160; 1,775 Other general operating 4,021 &#160; 3,089 Total noninterest expense $ 61,438 &#160; $ 59,731 ##TABLE_END\n\nNoninterest expense increased $1.7 billion to $61.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher investments in people and technology, expense associated with the settlement of the legacy monoline insurance litigation and expense related to certain regulatory matters, partially offset by lower net COVID-19 related costs. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\n##TABLE_START Table 4 Income Tax Expense (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Income before income taxes $ 30,969 &#160; $ 33,976 Income tax expense 3,441 &#160; 1,998 Effective tax rate 11.1 &#160; % 5.9 % ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome tax expense was $3.4 billion for 2022 compared to $2.0 billion in 2021 resulting in an effective tax rate of 11.1 percent compared to 5.9 percent. \n\nThe effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were primarily driven by our recurring preference benefits. Also included in the effective tax rate for 2021 was the impact of the 2021 U.K. tax law change further discussed in this section. For more information on our recurring tax preference benefits, see Note 19 &#8211; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Absent environmental, social and governance (ESG) tax credits and discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 25 percent. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions, including the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs. In particular, partnerships are no longer solely limited to an Investment Tax Credit, but can now also elect a Production Tax Credit for solar energy production facilities placed in service after December 31, 2021. \n\nOther notable tax law changes include the establishment of a new 15 percent AMT on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on net stock repurchases, both of which were effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The tax law changes for the new AMT permit business credits, including those from ESG investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, to offset potential AMT liability. The Corporation has assessed the potential impacts of these two U.S. tax law changes and does not expect the changes to have a significant effect on its future effective tax rate. \n\nOn June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which increased the U.K. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent. This change is effective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings. As a result, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Corporation recorded a positive income tax adjustment of approximately $2.0 billion with a corresponding write-up of U.K. net deferred tax assets, which reflected a reversal of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U.K. corporation income tax rate. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n29 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBalance Sheet Overview \n\n##TABLE_START Table 5 Selected Balance Sheet Data &#160; December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 $ Change % Change Assets &#160; &#160; Cash and cash equivalents \n\n$ 230,203 &#160; $ 348,221 $ (118,018) (34) % Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell \n\n267,574 &#160; 250,720 16,854 7 Trading account assets 296,108 &#160; 247,080 49,028 20 Debt securities 862,819 &#160; 982,627 (119,808) (12) Loans and leases 1,045,747 &#160; 979,124 66,623 7 Allowance for loan and lease losses (12,682) (12,387) (295) 2 All other assets 361,606 &#160; 374,110 (12,504) (3) Total assets $ 3,051,375 &#160; $ 3,169,495 $ (118,120) (4) Liabilities Deposits $ 1,930,341 &#160; $ 2,064,446 $ (134,105) (6) Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase \n\n195,635 &#160; 192,329 3,306 2 Trading account liabilities 80,399 &#160; 100,690 (20,291) (20) Short-term borrowings 26,932 &#160; 23,753 3,179 13 Long-term debt 275,982 &#160; 280,117 (4,135) (1) All other liabilities 268,889 &#160; 238,094 30,795 13 Total liabilities 2,778,178 &#160; 2,899,429 (121,251) (4) Shareholders&#8217; equity 273,197 &#160; 270,066 3,131 1 Total liabilities and shareholders&#8217; equity $ 3,051,375 &#160; $ 3,169,495 $ (118,120) (4) ##TABLE_END\n\nAssets \n\nAt December 31, 2022, total assets were approximately $3.1 trillion, down $118.1 billion from December 31, 2021. The decrease in assets was primarily due to lower debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in loans and leases, trading account assets and federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $118.0 billion primarily driven by lower deposits and continued loan growth . \n\nFederal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell \n\nFederal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized lending transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement and for collateral. Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or \n\npurchased under agreements to resell increased $16.9 billion primarily due to client activity within Global Markets . \n\nTrading Account Assets \n\nTrading account assets consist primarily of long positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account assets increased $49.0 billion primarily due to client activity within Global Markets . \n\nDebt Securities \n\nDebt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to leverage market conditions that create economically attractive returns on these investments. Debt securities decreased $119.8 billion primarily driven by lower deposits and continued loan growth. For more information on debt securities, see Note 4 &#8211; Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 30 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLoans and Leases \n\nLoans and leases increased $66.6 billion primarily driven by growth in commercial loans, higher credit card spending and higher residential mortgages due to lower paydowns and continued originations. For more information on the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 59. \n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses \n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses increased $295 million primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlo ok, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 73. \n\nAll Other Assets \n\nAll other assets decreased $12.5 billion primarily driven by a decline in margin loans and loans held-for-sale (LHFS). \n\nLiabilities \n\nAt December 31, 2022, total liabilities were approximately $2.8 trillion, down $121.3 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower deposits. \n\nDeposits \n\nDeposits decreased $134.1 billion primarily due to an increase in customer spending and a shift to higher yielding accounts. \n\nFederal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase \n\nFederal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $3.3 billion primarily driven by an increase in repurchase agreements to support liquidity. \n\nTrading Account Liabilities \n\nTrading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. Treasury and agency securities, non-U.S. sovereign debt and corporate securities. Trading account liabilities decreased $20.3 billion primarily due to lower levels of short positions within Global Markets . \n\nShort-term Borrowings \n\nShort-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that generally have maturities of one year or less. Short-term borrowings increased $3.2 billion primarily due to an increase in FHLB advances and commercial paper to manage liquidity needs. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10 &#8211; Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nLong-term Debt \n\nLong-term debt decreased $4.1 billion primarily due to maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by issuances. For more information on long-term debt, see Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAll Other Liabilities \n\nAll other liabilities increased $30.8 billion primarily driven by Global Markets client activity. \n\nShareholders&#8217; Equity \n\nShareholders&#8217; equity increased $3.1 billion primarily due to net income and the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities, and returns of capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases. \n\nCash Flows Overview \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and leases. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements, long-term debt and common and preferred stock. For more information on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 54. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n31 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental Financial Data \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nIn this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n\nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. \n\nWe may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. \n\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (&#8220;adjusted&#8221; shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible \n\ncommon shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are: \n\n&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. \n\n&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. \n\n&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. \n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. \n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7. \n\nFor more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 85. \n\nKey Performance Indicators \n\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 167. \n\nOur consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 28, Table 6 on page 33 and Table 7 on page 34. \n\nFor information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 37. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 32 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Table 6 Selected Annual Financial Data (In millions, except per share information) 2022 2021 2020 Income statement &#160; Net interest income $ 52,462 &#160; $ 42,934 $ 43,360 Noninterest income 42,488 &#160; 46,179 42,168 Total revenue, net of interest expense 94,950 &#160; 89,113 85,528 Provision for credit losses 2,543 &#160; (4,594) 11,320 Noninterest expense 61,438 &#160; 59,731 55,213 Income before income taxes 30,969 &#160; 33,976 18,995 Income tax expense 3,441 &#160; 1,998 1,101 Net income 27,528 &#160; 31,978 17,894 Net income applicable to common shareholders 26,015 &#160; 30,557 16,473 Average common shares issued and outstanding 8,113.7 &#160; 8,493.3 8,753.2 Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding 8,167.5 &#160; 8,558.4 8,796.9 Performance ratios &#160; &#160; &#160; Return on average assets (1) \n\n0.88 &#160; % 1.05 % 0.67 % Return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity (1) \n\n10.75 &#160; 12.23 6.76 Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (1, 2) \n\n15.15 &#160; 17.02 9.48 Return on average shareholders&#8217; equity (1) \n\n10.18 &#160; 11.68 6.69 Return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity (1, 2) \n\n13.76 &#160; 15.71 9.07 Total ending equity to total ending assets 8.95 &#160; 8.52 9.68 Common equity ratio (1) \n\n8.02 &#160; 7.74 8.81 Total average equity to total average assets 8.62 &#160; 9.02 9.96 Dividend payout (1) \n\n26.77 &#160; 21.51 38.18 Per common share data &#160; &#160; &#160; Earnings $ 3.21 &#160; $ 3.60 $ 1.88 Diluted earnings 3.19 &#160; 3.57 1.87 Dividends paid 0.86 &#160; 0.78 0.72 Book value (1) \n\n30.61 &#160; 30.37 28.72 Tangible book value (2) \n\n21.83 &#160; 21.68 20.60 Market capitalization $ 264,853 &#160; $ 359,383 $ 262,206 Average balance sheet &#160; &#160; &#160; Total loans and leases $ 1,016,782 &#160; $ 920,401 $ 982,467 Total assets 3,135,894 &#160; 3,034,623 2,683,122 Total deposits 1,986,158 &#160; 1,914,286 1,632,998 Long-term debt 246,479 &#160; 237,703 220,440 Common shareholders&#8217; equity 241,981 &#160; 249,787 243,685 Total shareholders&#8217; equity 270,299 &#160; 273,757 267,309 Asset quality &#160; &#160; &#160; Allowance for credit losses (3) \n\n$ 14,222 &#160; $ 13,843 $ 20,680 Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties (4) \n\n3,978 &#160; 4,697 5,116 Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding (4) \n\n1.22 &#160; % 1.28 % 2.04 % Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and leases (4) \n\n333 &#160; 271 380 Net charge-offs $ 2,172 &#160; $ 2,243 $ 4,121 Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding (4) \n\n0.21 &#160; % 0.25 % 0.42 % \n\nCapital ratios at year end (5) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Common equity tier 1 capital 11.2 &#160; % 10.6 % 11.9 % Tier 1 capital 13.0 &#160; 12.1 13.5 Total capital 14.9 &#160; 14.1 16.1 Tier 1 leverage 7.0 &#160; 6.4 7.4 Supplementary leverage ratio 5.9 &#160; 5.5 7.2 Tangible equity (2) \n\n6.8 &#160; 6.4 7.4 Tangible common equity (2) \n\n5.9 &#160; 5.7 6.5 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) For definition, see Key Metrics on page 167. \n\n(2) Tangible equity ratios and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below. \n\nWe periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment&#8217;s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 46. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital.

As a result, total earning assets and total assets of the businesses may not equal total Consumer Banking . \n\nn/m = not meaningful \n\nConsumer Banking, comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. Deposits and Consumer Lending include the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances between Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM , as well as other client-managed businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a coast-to-coast network including financial centers in 38 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2022, our network includes approximately 3,900 financial centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading digital banking platforms with more than 44 million active users, including approximately 35 million active mobile users. \n\nConsumer Banking Results \n\nNet income for Consumer Banking increased $625 million to $12.5 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $5.1 billion to $30.0 billion primarily driven by higher interest rates and the benefits of higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021. Noninterest income decreased $486 million to $8.6 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, partially offset by a gain on the sale of an affinity card loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $3.0 billion to $2.0 billion primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened \n\nmacroeconomic outlook in 2022, compared to a benefit in 2021 due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $787 million to $20.1 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth, including marketing, technology and people, as well as increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization and the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation in the prior year. \n\nThe return on average allocated capital was 31 percent, unchanged from 2021. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 37. \n\nDeposits \n\nDeposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities that consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, money market savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, as well as investment accounts and products. Net interest income is allocated to deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Consumer Investment accounts. Consumer Investments serves investment client relationships through the Merrill Edge integrated investing and banking service platform, providing investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, self-directed online investing and key banking capabilities including access to the \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 38 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCorporation&#8217;s network of financial centers and ATMs. \n\nNet income for Deposits increased $2.4 billion to $7.1 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $4.9 billion to $19.3 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income decreased $585 million to $3.1 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, partially offset by higher other service charges due to increased client activity. \n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $324 million to $564 million primarily driven by increased overdraft losses due to higher payment activity related to checking accounts. The benefit in the prior year was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $743 million to $12.4 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization in the prior year. \n\nAverage deposits increased $80.7 billion to $1.1 trillion primarily due to net inflows of $46.8 billion in checking and $34.9 billion in money market savings largely driven by strong organic growth. \n\nThe table below provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/mobile trends. \n\n##TABLE_START Key Statistics &#8211; Deposits 2022 2021 Total deposit spreads (excludes noninterest costs) (1) \n\n1.86% 1.69% Year End \n\nConsumer investment assets (in millions) (2) \n\n$ 319,648 $ 368,831 \n\nActive digital banking users (in thousands) (3) \n\n44,054 41,365 \n\nActive mobile banking users (in thousands) (4) \n\n35,452 32,980 Financial centers 3,913 4,173 ATMs 15,528 16,209 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes deposits held in Consumer Lending. \n\n(2) Includes client brokerage assets, deposit sweep balances and AUM in Consumer Banking . \n\n(3) Represents mobile and/or online active users over the past 90 days. \n\n(4) Represents mobile active users over the past 90 days. \n\nConsumer investment assets decreased $49.2 billion to $319.6 billion driven by market performance, partially offset by client flows. Active mobile banking users increased approximately two million, reflecting continuing changes in our clients&#8217; banking preferences. We had a net decrease of 260 financial centers and 681 ATMs as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network. \n\nConsumer Lending \n\nConsumer Lending offers products to consumers and small businesses across the U.S. The products offered include debit and credit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer Lending generates interchange revenue from debit and credit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees. Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home \n\nequity loans, including loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others. \n\nNet income for Consumer Lending decreased $1.8 billion to $5.4 billion primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $220 million to $10.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and loan balances, largely offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021. Noninterest income increased $99 million to $5.4 billion primarily driven by a gain on the sale of an affinity card loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $2.7 billion to $1.4 billion primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic environment in 2022 compared to a benefit in 2021 due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $44 million to $7.7 billion largely driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation in the prior year. \n\nAverage loans increased $8.6 billion to $288.2 billion primarily driven by an increase in credit card loans and first mortgage loans, partially offset by a decline in PPP loans. \n\nThe table below provides key performance indicators for Consumer Lending.

The operating margin remained unchanged at 28 percent compared to a year ago. \n\nNet interest income increased $1.8 billion to $7.5 billion due to the impacts of higher interest rates, as well as the benefits of higher loan and deposit balances. \n\nNoninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $802 million to $14.3 billion primarily due to the impacts of lower market valuations and declines in AUM pricing, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows. \n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $307 million primarily due to a dampened macroeconomic outlook and loan growth in the current-year period, compared to a benefit in the prior-year period due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $232 million to $15.5 billion primarily due to continued investments in the business, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives. \n\nThe return on average allocated capital was 27 percent, up from 26 percent, due to higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital.

Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, MBS, commodities and asset-backed securities. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . For information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 43. \n\nThe following explanations for year-over-year changes for \n\nGlobal Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 32. \n\nNet income for Global Markets decreased $375 million to $4.2 billion. Net DVA gains were $20 million compared to losses of $54 million in 2021. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $431 million to $4.2 billion. These decreases were primarily driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. \n\nRevenue decreased $1.1 billion to $18.1 billion primarily due to lower investment banking fees, partially offset by higher sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue increased $1.3 billion, and excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased $1.2 billion. These increases were driven by higher revenue in both FICC and Equities. \n\nNoninterest expense decreased $612 million to $12.4 billion primarily driven by the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an acceleration of expenses from incentive compensation award changes in the prior year . \n\nAverage total assets increased $71.6 billion to $857.6 billion driven by loan growth and commodities activity in FICC. Period-end total assets increased $64.7 billion to $812.5 billion \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 44 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ndriven by loan growth, an increase in commodities activity, and higher derivative balances due to higher interest rates. \n\nThe return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, down from 12 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 37. \n\nSales and Trading Revenue \n\nSales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets which are included in market making and similar activities, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion also present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 32. \n\n##TABLE_START Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2, 3) \n\n(Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Sales and trading revenue Fixed income, currencies and commodities \n\n$ 9,917 &#160; $ 8,761 Equities 6,572 &#160; 6,428 Total sales and trading revenue $ 16,489 &#160; $ 15,189 \n\nSales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (4) \n\nFixed income, currencies and commodities \n\n$ 9,898 &#160; $ 8,810 Equities 6,571 &#160; 6,433 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA \n\n$ 16,469 &#160; $ 15,243 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n(2) Includes FTE adjustments of $354 million and $421 million for 2022 and 2021. \n\n(3) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $1.0 billion and $510 million for 2022 and 2021. \n\n(4) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA gains (losses) were $19 million and $(49) million for 2022 and 2021. Equities net DVA gains (losses) were $1 million and $(5) million for 2022 and 2021. \n\nIncluding and excluding net DVA, FICC revenue increased $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion driven by improved trading performance across interest rate and currency products, partially offset by a weaker trading environment for credit products in the current-year period and a gain in commodities from a weather-related event in the prior year . Including and excluding net DVA, Equities revenue increased $144 million and $138 million driven by strong performances in derivatives and client financing activities, partially offset by a weaker performance in cash. \n\nAll Other \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 % Change Net interest income $ 117 &#160; $ 246 (52) % Noninterest income (loss) (5,479) (5,589) (2) Total revenue, net of interest expense (5,362) (5,343) &#8212; Provision for credit losses (172) (182) (5) Noninterest expense 2,485 &#160; 1,519 64 Loss before income taxes (7,675) (6,680) 15 Income tax benefit (6,023) (8,069) (25) Net income (loss) $ (1,652) $ 1,389 n/m Balance Sheet Year Ended December 31 Average 2022 2021 % Change Total loans and leases $ 12,683 &#160; $ 18,447 (31) % \n\nTotal assets (1) \n\n139,466 &#160; 191,831 (27) Total deposits 20,082 &#160; 16,512 22 Year end December 31 2022 December 31 2021 % Change Total loans and leases $ 10,234 &#160; $ 15,863 (35) % \n\nTotal assets (1) \n\n155,074 &#160; 214,153 (28) Total deposits 19,905 &#160; 21,182 (6) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders&#8217; equity. Average allocated assets were $1.1 trillion for both 2022 and 2021, and year-end allocated assets were $1.0 trillion and $1.2 trillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nn/m = not meaningful \n\nAll Other primarily consists of asset and liability management (ALM) activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 23 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nNet income decreased $3.0 billion to a loss of $1.7 billion primarily due to a lower income tax benefit and higher noninterest expense. \n\nNoninterest expense increased $966 million primarily driven by the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021, expense associated with the settlement of the legacy monoline insurance litigation and expense related to certain regulatory matters, partially offset by decreases in other expenses. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n45 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe income tax benefit was $6.0 billion in 2022 compared to a benefit of $8.1 billion in 2021. The decrease in the tax benefit was primarily driven by the impact of the U.K. tax law change in 2021. For more information, see Financial Highlights - Income Tax Expense on page 29. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets . \n\nManaging Risk \n\nRisk is inherent in all our business activities. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the ERC and the Board. \n\nThe seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. \n\n&#9679; Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate. \n\n&#9679; Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. \n\n&#9679; Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings. Market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk. \n\n&#9679; Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. \n\n&#9679; Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures. \n\n&#9679; Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people or external events. \n\n&#9679; Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations. \n\nThe following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk. This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the ERC and the Board. \n\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how we drive Responsible Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success of the Corporation and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the Board. \n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. \n\nExecutive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business. Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and recommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. Management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business. Capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve. For more information regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 37. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements. Our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the Board in assessing the Corporation&#8217;s risk profile against our risk appetite and risk capacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits. \n\nOur overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner at all times, including during periods of stress. \n\nOur lines of business operate with risk limits that align with the Corporation&#8217;s risk appetite. Senior management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits. The Board, and its committees when appropriate, oversee financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls. \n\nFor a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 49 through 82. \n\nRisk Management Governance \n\nThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the Board and its committees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive officers. Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which may be evidenced in documents such as committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions. \n\nThe chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the Board, Board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 46 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBoard of Directors and Board Committees \n\nThe Board is composed of 15 directors, all but one of whom are independent. The Board authorizes management to maintain an effective Risk Framework and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, the Board or its committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from senior management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of Global Risk Management (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile and oversee senior management addressing key risks we face. Other Board committees, as described below, provide additional oversight of specific risks. \n\nEach of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the Board on risk-related matters within the committee&#8217;s responsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks. \n\nAudit Committee \n\nThe Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance and independence of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, the performance of our corporate audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of senior management or the Chief Audit Executive (CAE) to determine whether there are scope or resource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. \n\nEnterprise Risk Committee \n\nThe ERC oversees the Corporation&#8217;s Risk Framework, risk appetite and senior management&#8217;s responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks facing the Corporation. The ERC may consult with other Board committees on risk-related matters. \n\nOther Board Committees \n\nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee oversees our Board&#8217;s governance processes, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential Board members, leads \n\nBoard and committee succession planning and their formal self-evaluation, and reviews our ESG activities, shareholder input and shareholder engagement process. \n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officer&#8217;s (CEO) compensation to our Board for further approval by all independent directors; reviewing and approving our executive officers&#8217; compensation, as well as compensation for non-management directors; and reviewing certain other human capital management topics, including pay equity and diversity and inclusion. \n\nManagement Committees \n\nManagement committees receive their authority from the Board, a Board committee, or another management committee. Our primary management risk committee is the MRC. Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the Corporation, including an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity. \n\nLines of Defense \n\nWe have clear ownership and accountability for managing risk across three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs and GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three lines of defense are integrated into our management-level governance structure. Each of these functional roles is further described in this section. \n\nExecutive Officers \n\nExecutive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the Board, Board committees or management-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals. Executive officers review our activities for consistency with our Risk Framework, risk appetite, and applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies and standards. Executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. Executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n47 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFront Line Units \n\nFLUs, which include the lines of business as well as Global Technology and Global Operations, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities. \n\nThree organizational units that include FLU activities and control function activities, but are not part of GRM are first, the Chief Financial Officer Group; second, the Chief Administrative Officer Group; and third, Global Strategy and Enterprise Platforms. \n\nGlobal Risk Management \n\nGRM is part of our control functions and operates as our independent risk management function. GRM, led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions. GRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures outlining how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled. \n\nThe CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing risk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports directly to both the ERC and the CEO. GRM is organized into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical CRO teams that cover a particular FLU or control function. These teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties. \n\nCorporate Audit \n\nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from the FLUs, GRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee. The CAE administratively reports to the CEO. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit processes across the Corporation&#8217;s credit platform through examinations and monitoring. \n\nRisk Management Processes \n\nThe Risk Framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and in day-to-day business processes across the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. We employ an effective risk management process, referred to as Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily activities. \n\nIdentify &#8211; To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively identified and well understood. Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors. Each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly. Risk identification is an ongoing process that incorporates input from FLUs and control functions. It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business. \n\nMeasure &#8211; Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic process including qualitative statements and quantitative limits. Risk is measured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU and legal entity, and also on an aggregate basis. This risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, \n\nconcentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic environment. Senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios. \n\nMonitor &#8211; We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies and standards. We also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through our monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. We also know when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions. This includes timely requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level committees or the Board (directly or through an appropriate committee). \n\nControl &#8211; We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes. The limits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or the Board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume, operational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk categories). Our FLUs are held accountable for performing within the established limits. \n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. We instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities. Establishing a culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers&#8217; financial lives better and delivering on Responsible Growth is also critical to effective risk management. We are committed to the highest principles of ethical and professional conduct. Conduct risk is the risk of improper actions, behaviors or practices by the Corporation, its employees or representatives that are illegal, unethical and/or contrary to our core values that could result in harm to the Corporation, our shareholders or our customers, damage the integrity of the financial markets, or negatively impact our reputation. We have established protocols and structures so that conduct risk is governed and reported across the Corporation appropriately. All employees are held accountable for adhering to the Code of Conduct, operating within our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business activities. In addition, our performance management and compensation practices encourage responsible risk-taking that is consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite. \n\nCorporation-wide Stress Testing \n\nIntegral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. The intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and certain subsidiaries and how they impact financial resiliency, which provides confidence to management, regulators and our investors. \n\nContingency Planning \n\nWe have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 48 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\npotential adverse economic, financial or market stress. These contingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan and Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other de-risking strategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America. \n\nStrategic Risk Management \n\nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments. \n\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the Corporation&#8217;s capital levels are not adequate to meet minimum regulatory requirements and support execution of business activities or absorb losses from risks during normal or adverse economic and market conditions. As such, capital risk is managed in parallel to strategic risk. \n\nWe manage strategic risk through the Strategic Risk Enterprise Policy and integration into the strategic planning process, among other activities. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks impacting each business. \n\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk Appetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, senior management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. \n\nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. With oversight by the Board and the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business \n\nis based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions. \n\nCapital Management \n\nThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. \n\nWe conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees. \n\nWe periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For more information, see Business Segment Operations on page 37. \n\nCCAR and Capital Planning \n\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, our stress capital buffer (SCB) increased to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent, effective October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. \n\nIn October 2021, the Board authorized the Corporation&#8217;s $25 billion common stock repurchase program. Additionally, the Board authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation&#8217;s equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board&#8217;s authorizations, during 2022, we repurchased $5.1 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. \n\nThe timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n49 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRegulatory Capital \n\nAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and outlined two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models. \n\nThe Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements are used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of December 31, 2022, the common equity tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios. \n\nMinimum Capital Requirements \n\nIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement was 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, the Corporation&#8217;s SCB increased to 3.4 percent, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Advanced approaches \n\nremains unchanged at 9.5 percent. \n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee&#8217;s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation&#8217;s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent from 2.5 percent on January 1, 2024, which will increase our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio of 11.2 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its current CET1 capital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement expected to be in place as of January 1, 2024 due to an anticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge. \n\nThe Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. \n\nCapital Composition and Ratios \n\nTable 10 presents Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 50 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Table 10 Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital under Basel 3 Standardized Approach (1) \n\nAdvanced Approaches (1) \n\nRegulatory Minimum (2) \n\n(Dollars in millions, except as noted) December 31, 2022 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 180,060 &#160; $ 180,060 &#160; Tier 1 capital 208,446 &#160; 208,446 &#160; Total capital (3) \n\n238,773 &#160; 230,916 &#160; Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,605 &#160; 1,411 &#160; Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.2 &#160; % 12.8 &#160; % 10.4 &#160; % Tier 1 capital ratio 13.0 &#160; 14.8 &#160; 11.9 &#160; Total capital ratio 14.9 &#160; 16.4 &#160; 13.9 &#160; Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (4) \n\n$ 2,997 &#160; $ 2,997 &#160; Tier 1 leverage ratio 7.0 &#160; % 7.0 &#160; % 4.0 &#160; Supplementary leverage exposure (in billions) $ 3,523 &#160; Supplementary leverage ratio 5.9 &#160; % 5.0 &#160; December 31, 2021 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 171,759 $ 171,759 Tier 1 capital 196,465 196,465 Total capital (3) \n\n227,592 220,616 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,618 1,399 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 10.6 % 12.3 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 12.1 14.0 11.0 Total capital ratio 14.1 15.8 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (4) \n\n$ 3,087 $ 3,087 Tier 1 leverage ratio 6.4 % 6.4 % 4.0 Supplementary leverage exposure (in billions) $ 3,604 Supplementary leverage ratio 5.5 % 5.0 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020. \n\n(2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Corporation's SCB applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach was 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent or the SCB, as applicable, of 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. \n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. \n\n(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, CET1 capital was $180.1 billion, an increase of $8.3 billion from December 31, 2021, due to earnings, partially offset by dividends, common stock repurchases and higher net unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). Tier 1 capital increased $12.0 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital as well as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $11.2 billion primarily due to the same factors driving the increase in \n\nTier 1 capital and an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital, partially offset by a decrease in subordinated debt. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at December 31, 2022, decreased $13.0 billion during 2022 to $1,605 billion primarily due to lower counterparty exposures in Global Markets and a decrease in debt securities in the Treasury portfolio, partially offset by loan growth. Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2022 decreased $80.3 billion primarily due to lower debt securities, driven by lower deposits, partially offset by loan growth. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n51 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTable 11 shows the capital composition at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 11 Capital Composition under Basel 3 December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Total common shareholders&#8217; equity $ 244,800 &#160; $ 245,358 \n\nCECL transitional amount (1) \n\n1,881 &#160; 2,508 Goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities (68,644) (68,641) Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (7,776) (7,743) Intangibles, other than mortgage servicing rights, net of related deferred tax liabilities (1,554) (1,605) Defined benefit pension plan net assets (867) (1,261) Cumulative unrealized net (gain) loss related to changes in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to own creditworthiness, net-of-tax 496 &#160; 1,400 \n\nAccumulated net (gain) loss on certain cash flow hedges (2) \n\n11,925 &#160; 1,870 Other (201) (127) Common equity tier 1 capital 180,060 &#160; 171,759 Qualifying preferred stock, net of issuance cost 28,396 &#160; 24,707 Other (10) (1) Tier 1 capital 208,446 &#160; 196,465 Tier 2 capital instruments 18,751 &#160; 20,750 \n\nQualifying allowance for credit losses (3) \n\n11,739 &#160; 10,534 Other (163) (157) Total capital under the Standardized approach 238,773 &#160; 227,592 \n\nAdjustment in qualifying allowance for credit losses under the Advanced approaches (3) \n\n(7,857) (6,976) Total capital under the Advanced approaches $ 230,916 &#160; $ 220,616 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes the impact of the Corporation's adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020 and 25 percent of the increase in reserves since the initial adoption. \n\n(2) Includes amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the hedging of items that are not recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n(3) Includes the impact of transition provisions related to the CECL accounting standard. \n\nTable 12 shows the components of RWA as measured under Basel 3 at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 12 Risk-weighted Assets under Basel 3 Standardized Approach Advanced Approaches Standardized Approach Advanced Approaches December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2022 2021 Credit risk $ 1,538 &#160; $ 939 &#160; $ 1,549 $ 913 Market risk 67 &#160; 67 &#160; 69 69 \n\nOperational risk (1) \n\nn/a 364 &#160; n/a 378 Risks related to credit valuation adjustments n/a 41 &#160; n/a 39 Total risk-weighted assets $ 1,605 &#160; $ 1,411 &#160; $ 1,618 $ 1,399 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) December 31, 2022 includes the effects of an update made to our operational risk RWA model during the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\nn/a = not applicable \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 52 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBank of America, N.A.

(BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). \n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&#38;S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. \n\nBofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At December 31, 2022, BofAS had tentative net capital of $20.9 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $17.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.1 billion. \n\nMLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At December 31, 2022, MLPCC&#8217;s regulatory net capital of $7.5 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.4 billion. \n\nMLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At December 31, 2022, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $6.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $137 million. \n\nOur European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the \n\nFinancial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2022, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $33.4 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $11.6 billion. \n\nBofASE is an authorized credit institution with its head office located in France. Previously, BofASE had been authorized as an investment firm, but following the European Union&#8217;s adoption of the harmonized Investment Firm Directive and Investment Firm Regulation prudential regime, it was required to apply for reauthorization as a credit institution. The application was approved in November 2022 and became effective on December 8, 2022. BofASE is authorized and regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism by the European Central Bank. At December 31, 2022, BofASE's capital resources were $9.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.0 billion. \n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers in the fourth quarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at December 31, 2022 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act. \n\nLiquidity Risk \n\nFunding and Liquidity Risk Management \n\nOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market fluctuation from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic environment. \n\nWe define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 54 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. \n\nThe Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan. The ERC establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels. The MRC is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels. The MRC reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing results, approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 46. Under this governance framework, we developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at Bank of America Corporation (Parent) and selected subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning. \n\nNB Holdings Corporation \n\nThe Parent, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. \n\nIn consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note to the Parent in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the Parent with a committed line of credit that allows the Parent to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the Parent to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the Parent becomes imminent. \n\nGlobal Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets \n\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of \n\nassets that are readily available to the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. \n\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 15 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2022 2021 Bank entities $ 694 &#160; $ 1,006 \n\nNonbank and other entities (1) \n\n174 &#160; 152 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources \n\n$ 868 &#160; $ 1,158 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. \n\nOur bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $348 billion and $322 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. \n\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the Parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. \n\nTable 16 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n55 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Table 16 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2022 2021 Cash on deposit $ 174 &#160; $ 259 U.S. Treasury securities 252 &#160; 278 U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities 427 &#160; 606 Non-U.S. government securities \n\n15 &#160; 15 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 868 &#160; $ 1,158 ##TABLE_END\n\nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $605 billion and $617 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 120 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. \n\nLiquidity Stress Analysis \n\nWe utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the Parent and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. \n\nThe types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results. \n\nWe consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. \n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio \n\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support \n\nthe ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement. \n\nDiversified Funding Sources \n\nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. \n\nThe primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make Parent funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. \n\nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $2.1 trillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. \n\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 10 &#8211; Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nTotal long-term debt decreased $4.1 billion to $276.0 billion during 2022 primarily due to debt maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. \n\nDuring 2022, we issued $66.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $44.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 56 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n$10.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $11.8 billion of other debt. During 2021, we issued $76.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $56.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, $8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $12.5 billion of other debt. \n\nDuring 2022, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $33.3 billion consisting of $19.8 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $9.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.6 billion of other debt. During 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $46.4 billion consisting of $24.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $10.4 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $11.6 billion of other debt. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Bank of America Corporation's senior notes of $205.9 billion included $179.1 billion of outstanding notes that are both TLAC eligible and callable at least one year before their stated maturities. Of these senior notes, $16.6 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible during 2023, and $21.4 billion, $21.3 billion, $16.0 billion and $24.4 billion will do so during each of 2024 through 2027, respectively, and $79.4 billion thereafter. \n\nWe issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During 2022, we issued $12.5 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. \n\nSubstantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nWe use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 79. \n\nUninsured Deposits \n\nThe FDIC insures the Corporation&#8217;s U.S. deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category, and various country-specific funds insure non-U.S. deposits up to specified limits. Deposits that exceed \n\ninsurance limits are uninsured. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s deposits totaled $1.9 trillion, of which total estimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. deposits were $617.6 billion and $102.8 billion. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s deposits totaled $2.1 trillion, of which total estimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. deposits were $701.4 billion and $111.9 billion. \n\nTable 17 presents information about the Corporation&#8217;s total estimated uninsured time deposits. For more information on our liquidity sources, see Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets, and for more information on deposits, see Diversified Funding Sources in this section. For more information on contractual time deposit maturities, see Note 9 &#8211; Deposits to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 17 \n\nUninsured Time Deposits (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; December 31, 2022 (Dollars in millions) U.S. Non-U.S. Total Uninsured time deposits with a maturity of: 3 months or less $ 3,721 $ 7,023 $ 10,744 &#160; Over 3 months through 6 months 2,230 275 2,505 &#160; Over 6 months through 12 months 2,712 86 2,798 &#160; Over 12 months 686 1,566 2,252 &#160; Total $ 9,349 &#160; $ 8,950 &#160; $ 18,299 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts are estimated based on the regulatory methodologies defined by each local jurisdiction. \n\nContingency Planning \n\nWe maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. \n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. \n\nCredit Ratings \n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies. \n\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n57 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ntime, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels . \n\nOther factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies&#8217; methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies&#8217; assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies&#8217; views on whether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis. \n\nOn September 19, 2022, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation. Fitch also affirmed and withdrew the long-term and short-term ratings on certain subsidiaries, as they are no longer considered relevant to the agency&#8217;s coverage. \n\nOn January 23, 2023, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (Moody&#8217;s) placed the long-term rating of the Corporation as well as the long-term rating of its rated subsidiaries, including BANA, on review for upgrade. The agency cited the Corporation&#8217;s strengthened capital ratios, improved earnings profile and continued commitment to maintaining a restrained risk appetite as drivers of the review. A review for upgrade indicates that those ratings are under consideration for a change in the near term and typically concludes within 90 days. Moody&#8217;s concurrently affirmed all Prime-1 short-term ratings of the Corporation and rated subsidiaries. \n\nThe current ratings and outlooks for the Corporation and its subsidiaries from Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings (S&#38;P) were not the subject of any rating actions during 2022 or through February 22, 2023. \n\nTable 18 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 18 Senior Debt Ratings Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings Fitch Ratings Long-term Short-term Outlook Long-term Short-term Outlook Long-term Short-term Outlook Bank of America Corporation A2 P-1 Review for Upgrade A- A-2 Positive AA- F1+ Stable Bank of America, N.A.

In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries&#8217; credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our Parent, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material. \n\nWhile certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company&#8217;s long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress \n\nAnalysis on page 56. \n\nFor more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\nCommon Stock Dividends \n\nFor a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during 2022 and through February 22, 2023, see Note 13 &#8211; Shareholders&#8217; Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFinance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor \n\nBofA Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (BofA Finance), is a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold, and is expected to continue to issue and sell, its senior unsecured debt securities (Guaranteed Notes) that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation. The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the Guaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA Finance. In addition, each of BAC Capital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust XV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts), is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 58 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSecurities) or capital securities (the Capital Securities and, together with the Guaranteed Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities, the Guaranteed Securities), as applicable, that remained outstanding at December 31, 2022. The Corporation guarantees the payment of amounts and distributions with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and Capital Securities if not paid by the Trusts, to the extent of funds held by the Trusts, and this guarantee, together with the Corporation&#8217;s other obligations with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and Capital Securities, effectively constitutes a full and unconditional guarantee of the Trusts&#8217; payment obligations on the Trust Preferred Securities or Capital Securities, as applicable. No other subsidiary of the Corporation guarantees the Guaranteed Securities. \n\nBofA Finance and each of the Trusts are finance subsidiaries, have no independent assets, revenues or operations and are dependent upon the Corporation and/or the Corporation&#8217;s other subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations under the Guaranteed Securities in the ordinary course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities make claims on their Guaranteed Securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding, any recoveries on those claims will be limited to those available under the applicable guarantee by the Corporation, as described above. \n\nThe Corporation is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for liquidity. Applicable laws and regulations and intercompany arrangements entered into in connection with the Corporation&#8217;s resolution plan could restrict the availability of funds from subsidiaries to the Corporation, which could adversely affect the Corporation&#8217;s ability to make payments under its guarantees. In addition, the obligations of the Corporation under the guarantees of the Guaranteed Securities will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to assets of the Corporation for payments. If the Corporation, as guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries, under the indenture governing the Guaranteed Notes, the subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required to assume the Corporation&#8217;s obligations under its guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes. \n\nFor more information on factors that may affect payments to holders of the Guaranteed Securities, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; NB Holdings Corporation in this section, Item 1. Business &#8211; Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority on page 6 and Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Liquidity on page 9. \n\nRepresentations and Warranties Obligations \n\nFor information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCredit Risk Management \n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments, which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or \n\nfair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives and Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below. \n\nWe refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories. \n\nDuring 2022, asset quality generally improved compared to 2021. Our 2022 net charge-off ratio remained near historic lows, and nonperforming loans and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased compared to 2021, which was partially offset by an increase in reservable criticized exposure associated with our direct exposure to Russia as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. While uncertainty around the pandemic has diminished, uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. \n\nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 64, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 70, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 73, and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on the factors that may expose us to credit risk, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nConsumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management \n\nCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n59 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nsources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. \n\nConsumer Credit Portfolio \n\nDuring 2022, the U.S. unemployment rate continued to decline and home prices increased compared to 2021, although they began to decline in the second half of 2022 as inflationary pressures continued to persist. During 2022, net charge-offs were $1.9 billion, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. During 2022, nonperforming loans declined primarily due to \n\ndecreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans whose prior-period deferrals expired and were modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during the first quarter of 2022. \n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $204 million during 2022 to $7.2 billion.

As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. \n\nResidential Mortgage \n\nThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 50 percent of consumer loans and leases in 2022. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 45 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other . \n\nOutstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $7.7 billion in 2022 as originations were partially offset by paydowns and loan sales. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 60 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which both had $2.2 billion of FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. \n\nTable 21 presents certain residential mortgage key credit \n\nstatistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2022, $1.4 billion, or 63 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $22 million. \n\nNet charge-offs of $72 million for 2022 increased $100 million compared to 2021 primarily due to loan sales that occurred in the second quarter of 2022. \n\nOf the $218.0 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2022, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.4 billion, or six percent, at December 31, 2022. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2022, $64 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only \n\nresidential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $844 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2022, $204 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $79 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 96 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later. \n\nTable 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 14 percent and 15 percent of outstandings at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 \n\nyears, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, 82 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , nine percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n61 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOutstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $1.4 billion in 2022 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and new originations. Of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021, $11.1 billion and $12.2 billion, or 42 percent and 44 percent, were in first-lien positions. At December 31, 2022, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior- \n\nlien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.5 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. \n\nUnused HELOCs totaled $42.4 billion and $40.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Of the nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2022, $275 million, or 54 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $167 million, or 33 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $61 million in 2022. \n\nNet recoveries decreased $29 million to $90 million in 2022 compared to 2021. \n\nOf the $26.6 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2022, as shown in Table 23, 13 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered the amortization period was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2022, $53 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that \n\nhad entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2022, $354 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. \n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During 2022, 10 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. \n\nTable 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent and 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer&#8217;s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. \n\nModifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $624 million and $672 million, of which $540 million and $599 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. \n\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management \n\nCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations \n\nto measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses. \n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nManagement of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations \n\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 36 \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 64 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nand Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 68. \n\nWe account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. \n\nIn addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, we may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. For more information, see Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCommercial Credit Portfolio \n\nDuring 2022, commercial credit quality improved as charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined. Due to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict, all direct exposure to Russian counterparties was downgraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, and expected credit losses (ECL) have been incorporated into our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. Outstanding \n\ncommercial loans and leases increased $45.9 billion during 2022 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in Global Banking . This increase was partially offset by lower U.S. small business commercial loans due to repayments of PPP loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program. \n\nCredit quality of commercial real estate borrowers generally improved from 2021 as pandemic-impacted sectors are recovering. However, many commercial real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging capital markets. Demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use. \n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and lease losses remained relatively unchanged at $5.4 billion at December 31, 2022, as loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook were offset by asset quality improvement and a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 73. \n\nTotal commercial utilized credit exposure increased $51.3 billion during 2022 to $704.9 billion primarily driven by higher loans and leases and derivative assets. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 56 percent at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nTable 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 29 Commercial Credit Exposure by Type &#160; Commercial Utilized (1) \n\nCommercial Unfunded (2, 3, 4) \n\nTotal Commercial Committed December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Loans and leases $ 589,362 &#160; $ 543,420 $ 487,772 &#160; $ 454,256 $ 1,077,134 &#160; $ 997,676 \n\nDerivative assets (5) \n\n48,642 &#160; 35,344 &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 48,642 &#160; 35,344 Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees 33,376 &#160; 34,389 1,266 &#160; 639 34,642 &#160; 35,028 Debt securities and other investments 20,195 &#160; 19,427 2,551 &#160; 4,638 22,746 &#160; 24,065 Loans held-for-sale 6,112 &#160; 13,185 3,729 &#160; 16,581 9,841 &#160; 29,766 Operating leases 5,509 &#160; 5,935 &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 5,509 &#160; 5,935 Commercial letters of credit 973 &#160; 1,176 28 &#160; 247 1,001 &#160; 1,423 Other 698 &#160; 652 &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 698 &#160; 652 Total $ 704,867 &#160; $ 653,528 $ 495,346 &#160; $ 476,361 $ 1,200,213 &#160; $ 1,129,889 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Commercial utilized exposure includes loans of $5.4 billion and $7.2 billion accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n(2) Commercial unfunded exposure includes commitments accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $3.0 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n(3) Excludes unused business card lines, which are not legally binding. \n\n(4) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions.

The increase in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of increases in the Electrical equipment and Trading companies and distributors, partially offset by a decrease in Building products. \n\nWhile the U.S. and global economies have shown signs of relief from the pandemic, uncertainty remains as a result of \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 68 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ngeopolitical and inflationary pressures, and a number of industries will likely continue to be adversely impacted due to these conditions. We continue to monitor all industries, \n\nparticularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 36 \n\nCommercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1) \n\nCommercial Utilized Total Commercial \n\nCommitted (2) \n\nDecember 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Asset managers &#38; funds $ 106,842 &#160; $ 89,786 $ 165,087 &#160; $ 136,914 \n\nReal estate (3) \n\n72,180 &#160; 69,384 99,722 &#160; 96,202 Capital goods 45,580 &#160; 42,784 87,314 &#160; 84,293 Finance companies 55,248 &#160; 59,327 79,546 &#160; 86,009 Healthcare equipment and services 33,554 &#160; 32,003 58,761 &#160; 58,195 Materials 26,304 &#160; 25,133 55,589 &#160; 53,652 Retailing 24,785 &#160; 24,514 53,714 &#160; 50,816 Government &#38; public education 34,861 &#160; 37,597 48,134 &#160; 50,066 Food, beverage and tobacco 23,232 &#160; 21,584 47,486 &#160; 45,419 Consumer services 26,980 &#160; 28,172 47,372 &#160; 48,052 Individuals and trusts 34,897 &#160; 29,752 45,572 &#160; 39,869 Commercial services and supplies 23,628 &#160; 22,390 41,596 &#160; 42,451 Utilities 20,292 &#160; 17,082 40,164 &#160; 36,855 Energy 15,132 &#160; 14,217 36,043 &#160; 34,136 Transportation 22,273 &#160; 21,079 33,858 &#160; 32,015 Technology hardware and equipment 11,441 &#160; 10,159 29,825 &#160; 26,910 Global commercial banks 27,217 &#160; 20,062 29,293 &#160; 21,390 Media 14,781 &#160; 12,495 28,216 &#160; 26,318 Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology 7,547 &#160; 5,608 26,208 &#160; 19,439 Software and services 12,961 &#160; 10,663 25,633 &#160; 27,643 Consumer durables and apparel 10,009 &#160; 9,740 21,389 &#160; 21,226 Vehicle dealers 12,909 &#160; 11,030 20,638 &#160; 15,678 Insurance 10,224 &#160; 5,743 19,444 &#160; 14,323 Telecommunication services 9,679 &#160; 10,056 17,349 &#160; 21,270 Automobiles and components 8,774 &#160; 9,236 16,911 &#160; 17,052 Food and staples retailing 7,157 &#160; 6,902 11,908 &#160; 12,226 Financial markets infrastructure (clearinghouses) 3,913 &#160; 3,876 8,752 &#160; 6,076 Religious and social organizations 2,467 &#160; 3,154 4,689 &#160; 5,394 Total commercial credit exposure by industry $ 704,867 &#160; $ 653,528 $ 1,200,213 &#160; $ 1,129,889 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure. \n\n(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. \n\nRisk Mitigation \n\nWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $9.0 billion and $2.6 billion. We recorded net losses of $37 million in 2022 compared to net losses $91 million in 2021. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 43.

We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all \n\ntrades. For more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nNon-U.S. Portfolio \n\nOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. \n\nTable 39 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at December 31, 2022. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $24.0 billion in 2022 primarily driven by increases in Germany, Japan, Ireland, India and Switzerland, partially offset by decreases in China, Belgium, Australia and Singapore. \n\nNon-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. \n\nFunded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and secured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 70 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Table 39 Top 20 Non-U.S. Countries Exposure (Dollars in millions) Funded Loans and Loan Equivalents Unfunded Loan Commitments Net Counterparty Exposure Securities/ Other Investments Country Exposure at December 31 2022 Hedges and Credit Default Protection Net Country Exposure at December 31 2022 Increase (Decrease) from December 31 2021 United Kingdom $ 29,965 $ 16,601 $ 7,243 $ 2,570 $ 56,379 $ (1,034) $ 55,345 &#160; $ 376 Germany 32,248 9,431 2,190 2,742 46,611 (885) 45,726 &#160; 11,901 France 13,888 8,064 2,023 3,604 27,579 (986) 26,593 &#160; 1,686 Canada 10,992 10,094 1,472 3,383 25,941 (368) 25,573 &#160; (738) Japan 19,239 1,806 1,366 1,502 23,913 (826) 23,087 &#160; 5,825 Australia 14,412 4,013 568 1,510 20,503 (286) 20,217 &#160; (1,087) Brazil 6,175 1,413 741 4,199 12,528 (28) 12,500 &#160; (250) China 6,489 294 1,378 2,932 11,093 (285) 10,808 &#160; (1,774) India 6,805 589 614 2,841 10,849 (80) 10,769 &#160; 2,138 Switzerland 7,039 3,063 469 438 11,009 (321) 10,688 &#160; 2,113 Singapore 4,017 627 126 4,874 9,644 (37) 9,607 &#160; (1,058) Netherlands 3,169 4,892 617 1,402 10,080 (797) 9,283 &#160; (313) South Korea 6,103 927 504 1,664 9,198 (72) 9,126 &#160; 974 Ireland 7,678 1,157 151 230 9,216 (126) 9,090 &#160; 3,551 Mexico 4,444 1,753 514 743 7,454 (62) 7,392 &#160; 930 Hong Kong 5,123 523 466 1,181 7,293 (22) 7,271 &#160; (56) Spain 2,433 2,170 398 1,067 6,068 (227) 5,841 &#160; (79) Italy 3,883 1,777 184 426 6,270 (602) 5,668 &#160; 464 Saudi Arabia 2,428 1,465 219 15 4,127 (109) 4,018 &#160; 545 Belgium 1,433 1,489 184 910 4,016 (153) 3,863 &#160; (1,168) Total top 20 non-U.S. countries exposure \n\n$ 187,963 $ 72,148 $ 21,427 $ 38,233 $ 319,771 $ (7,306) $ 312,465 &#160; $ 23,980 ##TABLE_END\n\nOur largest non-U.S. country exposure at December 31, 2022 was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $55.3 billion, which represents an increase of $376 million from December 31, 2021.

Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $45.7 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $11.9 billion from December 31, 2021.

This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 79. \n\nOur traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. \n\nOur trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section. \n\nGRM is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions. \n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Given that models are used across the Corporation, model risk impacts all risk types including credit, market and operational risks. The Enterprise Model Risk Policy defines model risk standards, consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. All models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model, independent model testing and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking. The Enterprise Model Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the MRC, oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nInterest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt \n\nsecurities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. \n\nForeign Exchange Risk \n\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits. \n\nMortgage Risk \n\nMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. For example, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. In addition, we originate a variety of MBS, which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. We also record MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 80. \n\nEquity Market Risk \n\nEquity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. \n\nCommodity Risk \n\nCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n75 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIssuer Credit Risk \n\nIssuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments. \n\nMarket Liquidity Risk \n\nMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management. \n\nTrading Risk Management \n\nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments. \n\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. \n\nWithin any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and \n\nstatistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience. \n\nVaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 49. \n\nGRM continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees. \n\nTrading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation&#8217;s Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board. \n\nIn periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. \n\nTable 43 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. \n\nIn addition, Table 43 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their corresponding hedges. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 43 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 76 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nused. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below, it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology. \n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 43 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. \n\nTable 43 presents year-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2022 and 2021 using a 99 percent confidence \n\nlevel. The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. \n\nThe annual average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for 2022 compared to 2021 driven by heightened market volatility and reduced diversification across asset classes. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 43 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities 2022 2021 (Dollars in millions) Year End Average High &#160;(1) \n\nLow &#160;(1) \n\nYear End Average High &#160;(1) \n\nLow &#160;(1) \n\nForeign exchange $ 38 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ 11 $ 12 $ 21 $ 5 Interest rate 36 &#160; 36 &#160; 56 &#160; 24 &#160; 54 40 80 16 Credit 76 &#160; 71 &#160; 106 &#160; 52 &#160; 73 69 84 53 Equity 18 &#160; 20 &#160; 33 &#160; 12 &#160; 21 24 35 19 Commodities 8 &#160; 13 &#160; 27 &#160; 7 &#160; 6 8 28 4 Portfolio diversification (81) (91) n/a n/a (114) (100) n/a n/a Total covered positions portfolio 95 &#160; 70 &#160; 140 &#160; 42 &#160; 51 53 85 34 \n\nImpact from less liquid exposures (2) \n\n35 &#160; 38 &#160; n/a n/a 8 20 n/a n/a Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio \n\n130 &#160; 108 &#160; 236 &#160; 61 &#160; 59 73 125 46 Fair value option loans 48 &#160; 51 &#160; 65 &#160; 37 &#160; 51 50 65 31 Fair value option hedges 16 &#160; 17 &#160; 24 &#160; 13 &#160; 15 16 20 11 Fair value option portfolio diversification (38) (36) n/a n/a (27) (32) n/a n/a Total fair value option portfolio 26 &#160; 32 &#160; 44 &#160; 23 &#160; 39 34 53 23 Portfolio diversification 9 &#160; (11) n/a n/a (24) (10) n/a n/a Total market-based portfolio $ 165 &#160; $ 129 &#160; 287 &#160; 70 &#160; $ 74 $ 97 169 54 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components.

Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 44 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n77 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Table 44 Average Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities &#8211; 99 percent and 95 percent VaR Statistics 2022 2021 (Dollars in millions) 99 percent 95 percent 99 percent 95 percent Foreign exchange $ 21 &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ 12 $ 8 Interest rate 36 &#160; 17 &#160; 40 20 Credit 71 &#160; 28 &#160; 69 21 Equity 20 &#160; 11 &#160; 24 12 Commodities 13 &#160; 7 &#160; 8 4 Portfolio diversification (91) (46) (100) (39) Total covered positions portfolio 70 &#160; 29 &#160; 53 26 Impact from less liquid exposures 38 &#160; 7 &#160; 20 2 Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio \n\n108 &#160; 36 &#160; 73 28 Fair value option loans 51 &#160; 14 &#160; 50 12 Fair value option hedges 17 &#160; 10 &#160; 16 9 Fair value option portfolio diversification (36) (13) (32) (9) Total fair value option portfolio 32 &#160; 11 &#160; 34 12 Portfolio diversification (11) (7) (10) (7) Total market-based portfolio $ 129 &#160; $ 40 &#160; $ 97 $ 33 ##TABLE_END\n\nBacktesting \n\nThe accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation. \n\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day trading revenues. \n\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. \n\nDuring 2022, there was one day where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. \n\nTotal Trading-related Revenue \n\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nTrading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. \n\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2022 and 2021. During 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 99 percent of the trading days, of which 90 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $9 million. This compares to 2021 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $45 million. \n\nTrading Portfolio Stress Testing \n\nBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. \n\nA set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 78 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nHistorical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management. \n\nStress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 46. \n\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book \n\nThe following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. \n\nInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. \n\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the future direction of interest rate movements as implied by market-based forward curves. \n\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our banking book balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. \n\nThe interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. \n\nTable 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in developing the forward curve used in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 45 Forward Rates December 31, 2022 &#160; Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 4.50 &#160; % 4.77 &#160; % 3.84 &#160; % 12-month forward rates 4.75 &#160; 4.78 &#160; 3.62 &#160; December 31, 2021 Spot rates 0.25 % 0.21 % 1.58 % 12-month forward rates 1.00 1.07 1.84 ##TABLE_END\n\nTable 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2022 and 2021 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero. Depending on the level of interest rates, Down-rate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock, particularly in low rate environments. \n\nThe overall decrease in asset sensitivity, as shown in the following table, to Up-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end and short-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 50. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 46 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Parallel Shifts +100 bps \n\ninstantaneous shift \n\n+100 +100 $ 3,829 &#160; $ 6,542 &#160;-100 bps instantaneous shift -100 -100 (4,591) n/m Flatteners &#160; &#160; Short-end \n\ninstantaneous change \n\n+100 &#8212; 3,698 &#160; 4,982 Long-end \n\ninstantaneous change \n\n&#8212; -100 (157) n/m Steepeners &#160; &#160; Short-end \n\ninstantaneous change \n\n-100 &#8212; (4,420) n/m Long-end \n\ninstantaneous change \n\n&#8212; +100 131 &#160; 1,646 ##TABLE_END\n\nn/m = not meaningful \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n79 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. \n\nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. \n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts \n\nWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. \n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 46. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant. \n\nRisk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation&#8217;s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nMortgage Banking Risk Management \n\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. \n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in \n\ninterest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. \n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $78 million, $39 million and $321 million. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCompliance and Operational Risk Management \n\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and our internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). We are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including those related to financial crimes and anti-money laundering, market conduct, trading activities, fair lending, privacy, data protection and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. \n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, people or external events, and includes legal risk. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. The Corporation faces a number of key operational risks including third-party risk, model risk, conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data risk. Operational risk can result in financial losses and reputational impacts and is a component in the calculation of total RWA used in the Basel 3 capital calculation. For more information on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on page 49. \n\nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses, including their compliance and operational risk. FLUs and control functions are required to understand their business processes and related risks and controls, including third-party dependencies and the related regulatory requirements, and monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment. In order to actively monitor and assess the performance of their processes and controls, they must conduct comprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and control functions must also adhere to compliance and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and financial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions are responsible for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the Corporation. Collectively, these efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency, which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption. \n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business activities and processes and evaluate FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying issues and risks, and reporting \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 80 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\non the state of the control environment. Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment and validation through testing of key compliance and operational risk processes and controls across the Corporation. \n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance &#8211; Enterprise Policy and Operational Risk Management &#8211; Enterprise Policy set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational risk information to executive management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global Compliance and Operational Risk&#8217;s responsibilities for conducting independent oversight of the Corporation&#8217;s compliance and operational risk management activities. The Board provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit Committee and the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC. \n\nA key operational risk facing the Corporation is information security, which includes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk includes exposure to failures or interruptions of service or security breaches resulting from malicious technological attacks that impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our or third parties' operations, systems or data. The Corporation seeks to mitigate information security risk and associated reputational and compliance risk by employing a multi-layered and intelligence-led Global Information Security Program focused on preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to and recovering from cyber threats and incidents and effectively operating the Corporation&#8217;s processes. Additionally, our business continuity policy, standards and procedures are designed to maintain the availability of business functions and enable impacted units within the Corporation and third parties to achieve strategic objectives in the event of a cybersecurity incident. \n\nThe Global Information Security Program is supported by three lines of defense. The Global Information Security Team within the first line of defense is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Global Information Security Program, which includes defining policies and procedures to safeguard the Corporation&#8217;s information systems and data, conducting vulnerability and third-party information security assessments, information security event management (e.g., responding to ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks), evaluation of external cyber intelligence, supporting industry cybersecurity efforts and working with governmental agencies, and developing employee training to support adherence to the Corporation&#8217;s policies and procedures. As the second line of defense, Global Compliance and Operational Risk independently assesses, monitors and tests information security risk across the Corporation, as well as the effectiveness of the Global Information Security Program. Corporate Audit serves as the third line of defense, conducting additional independent review and validation of the first-line processes and functions. As part of our Global Information Security Program, we leverage both internal and external assessments and partnerships with industry leaders to help approach information security holistically. Additionally the Corporation maintains a comprehensive enterprise-wide program that defines standards for the planning, sourcing, management, and oversight of third-party relationships and third-party access to its system, facilities, and/or confidential or proprietary data for a business purpose or supervisory function. \n\nThrough established governance structures, we have processes to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight of information security risk. These routines enable our three lines of defense and management to debate information security risks and monitor control performance to allow for further escalation to executive management, management and \n\nBoard-level committees or to the Board, as appropriate. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Bank of America&#8217;s Global Information Security Program and devotes significant time and attention to the oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk. The Board regularly discusses cybersecurity and information security risks with the Chief Technology and Information Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer. Additionally, the ERC receives regular reporting, and reviews and approves the Information Security Program and Policy on an annual basis. \n\nReputational Risk Management \n\nReputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations. Reputational risk may result from many of the Corporation&#8217;s activities, including those related to the management of our strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks. \n\nThe Corporation manages reputational risk through established policies and controls embedded throughout its business and risk management processes. We proactively monitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have processes established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner. If reputational risk events occur, we focus on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage to the Corporation&#8217;s reputation. The Corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks. The Corporation&#8217;s organization and governance structure provides oversight of reputational risks. Reputational risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to senior management and the ERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. In addition, each FLU has a committee, which includes representatives from Legal and Risk, that is responsible for the oversight of reputational risk, including approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks. \n\nClimate Risk Management \n\nClimate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. These changes and events may have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and transition risk. These risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. Physical risk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers&#8217; repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. Physical risk may also increase operational risk by impacting the Corporation&#8217;s facilities, employees, customers or vendors. Transition risks may amplify credit risk through the financial impacts of changes in policy, technology or the market on the Corporation or its counterparties. Unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk. In addition, reputational risk may arise, including from our climate-related practices and disclosures and if we do not meet our climate-related commitments. \n\nEffective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well- \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n81 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ndeveloped processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks. As climate risk spans all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework aligns with our Risk Framework and provides additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to environmental and social risks, inclusive of climate risk. \n\nOur governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk practices and strategies by the Board, supported by its ERC, as well as the MRC and the Responsible Growth Committee, both of which are management-level committees comprised of senior leaders across every major FLU and control function. The Responsible Growth Committee is supported by the ESG Disclosure sub-committee, which is responsible for reviewing and providing oversight of the Corporation&#8217;s climate and ESG-related public disclosures. \n\nOur climate risk management efforts are overseen by an executive officer who reports to the CRO. The Climate Risk Council, which consists of leaders across risk, FLU and control functions, meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our Risk Framework. \n\nIn 2021, we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal) and set 2030 emissions targets for our operations and supply chain. In connection with our Net Zero Goal, in 2022, we announced a target to reduce emissions by 2030 associated with our financing activities related to auto manufacturing, energy and power generation (2030 Targets). In our September 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report, we disclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emissions and emissions intensity metrics for these sectors, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our 2030 Targets. \n\nWe plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in 2023, and we plan to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by April 2024. \n\nAchieving our climate--related goals and targets, including our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, may require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. \n\nGiven the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein. \n\nFor more information about climate-related matters, including how the Corporation manages climate risk, and the Corporation&#8217;s climate-related goals and commitments, including our plans to achieve our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets and progress on our sustainable finance goals, see the Corporation&#8217;s website, including our 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report and the 2022 \n\nAnnual Report to shareholders available on the Investor Relations portion of our website in March 2023. The contents of the Corporation&#8217;s website and 2022 Annual Report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on climate-related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 8. \n\nThe foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2022 Annual Report to shareholders regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management, including environmental transition considerations, include &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. \n\nComplex Accounting Estimates \n\nOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. \n\nThe more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nThe allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on numerous estimates and assumptions, which require \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 82 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\na high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. A critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our quantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation, which have included a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook is weighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in 2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower gross domestic product (GDP) and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year. Generally, as the consensus estimates improve or deteriorate, the allowance for credit losses will change in a similar direction. There are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including, but not limited to, U.S. GDP and unemployment rates. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.2 percent, 4.7 percent and 4.3 percent in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow at 2.1 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the latest consensus estimates for the U.S. average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.7 percent and U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 0.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a tighter labor market and depressed growth expectations compared to our macroeconomic outlook as of December 31, 2021, and were factored into our allowance for credit losses estimate as of December 31, 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to contract 0.4 percent and grow 1.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. \n\nIn addition to the above judgments and estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all of which have some degree of uncertainty. The allowance for credit losses increased to $14.2 billion from $13.8 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily due to loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022. \n\nTo provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance for credit losses, the Corporation compared the December 31, 2022 modeled ECL from the baseline scenario and our adverse scenario. Relative to the baseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S. unemployment rate of nearly three percentage points higher than the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. GDP followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of approximately eight percent at the trough. This \n\nsensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $4 billion. \n\nWhile the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a different macroeconomic outlook. Importantly, the analysis does not incorporate a variety of factors, including qualitative reserves and the weighting of alternate scenarios, which could have offsetting effects on the estimate. Considering the variety of factors contemplated when developing and weighting macroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative factors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 is appropriate. \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards. \n\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. For more information, see Note 20 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nLevel 3 Assets and Liabilities \n\nFinancial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n83 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. \n\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. For more information on transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 20 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAccrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets \n\nAccrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction. \n\nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and \n\nbecause of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized. \n\nConsistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period. \n\nSee Note 19 &#8211; Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. For more information, see page 17 under Item 1A.

The Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers , LLP , an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\nBrian T. Moynihan \n\nChair, Chief Executive Officer and President \n\nAlastair M. Borthwick \n\nChief Financial Officer \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n87 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bank of America Corporation \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence \n\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses - Commercial and Consumer Card Loans \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of the expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 88 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nvalue option. As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $12.7 billion on total loans and leases of $1,040.0 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option. For commercial and consumer card loans, the expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party economists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing lifetime economic forecast scenarios, related weightings to each scenario and certain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including controls over the evaluation and approval of models, forecast scenarios and related weightings, and qualitative reserves. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s development, selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan \n\nand lease losses. The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss forecast models, the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios and related weightings and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves. \n\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation carries certain financial instruments at fair value, which includes $10.7 billion of assets and $7.1 billion of liabilities classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a recurring basis and $3.4 billion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a nonrecurring basis, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The Corporation determines the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs, such as volatility or implied yield, may be determined using quantitative-based extrapolations, pricing models or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment and estimation used by management to determine the fair value of these financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls related to valuation models, significant unobservable inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments and comparison of management&#8217;s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s significant unobservable inputs. \n\nCharlotte, North Carolina \n\nFebruary 22, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Corporation&#8217;s auditor since 1958. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n89 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries \n\n##TABLE_START Consolidated Statement of Income \n\n(In millions, except per share information) 2022 2021 2020 Net interest income &#160;

The term &#8220;the Corporation&#8221; as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries or affiliates. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments, which include the Corporation&#8217;s interests in affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation&#8217;s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income. \n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. \n\nNew Accounting Standards \n\nHedge Accounting \n\nThe FASB issued a new accounting standard that makes targeted improvements to the application of the fair value hedge accounting guidance for closed portfolios of financial assets. The targeted improvements were effective January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. \n\nFinancial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses \n\nThe FASB amended the accounting and disclosure requirements for expected credit losses (ECL) by removing the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and adding disclosures on the financial effect and subsequent performance of certain types of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The effects of these changes on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are not significant. The amendments were effective on January 1, 2023, which the Corporation adopted using a modified retrospective approach. \n\nSignificant Accounting Principles \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements. \n\nSecurities Financing Agreements \n\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. In instances where the interest is negative, the Corporation&#8217;s policy is to present negative interest on financial assets as interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense. For securities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option, the changes in the fair value of these securities financing agreements are recorded in market making and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s policy is to monitor the market value of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements do not create material credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not necessary. \n\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities. \n\nTrading Instruments \n\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade-date basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market making and similar activities. \n\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities \n\nDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other risk management activities). The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 94 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAll derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. \n\nValuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Corporation&#8217;s own credit standing. \n\nTrading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities \n\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities. \n\nDerivatives used for other risk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are included in market making and similar activities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in market making and similar activities and other income. \n\nDerivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) \n\nFor accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship. \n\nFair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the Corporation&#8217;s assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value \n\nhedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability. \n\nCash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item. \n\nNet investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities. \n\nSecurities \n\nDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date. Their classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities purchased for use in the Corporation&#8217;s trading activities are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in market making and similar activities. Substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation&#8217;s asset and liability management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities carried at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in market making and similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. \n\nThe Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL, except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n95 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ndetermine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an ECL. The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its current estimate of expected credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset. \n\nThe Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the remaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses. \n\nInterest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method. \n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable price changes. These securities are reported in other assets. \n\nLoans and Leases \n\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are measured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income. \n\nUnder applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivable. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivable is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation&#8217;s three portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other \n\nconsumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business commercial. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of the ECL in the Corporation&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Upon adoption, a $ 3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase in the allowance for credit losses was recorded on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net increase of $ 2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $ 310 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the current estimate of ECL. \n\nFor loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-ended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation does not record any allowance. \n\nIn its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 96 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nand the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends. \n\nThe estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off. \n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for TDRs is measured based on the present value of projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan&#8217;s collateral value or its observable market price, if available. The measurement of ECL for the renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook as discussed above. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool. \n\nAlso included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. \n\nWith the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded. \n\nThe Corporation has identified the following three portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods. \n\nConsumer Real Estate \n\nTo estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation&#8217;s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the \n\nCorporation&#8217;s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation&#8217;s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of default. \n\nFor loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate. \n\nFor loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporation&#8217;s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative charge-off amount. \n\nCredit Cards and Other Consumer \n\nCredit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable. \n\nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined using quantitative methods supplemented with \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n97 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nqualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value. \n\nCommercial \n\nThe ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loan&#8217;s contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower&#8217;s draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower&#8217;s current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower&#8217;s industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns. \n\nIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments. \n\nNonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies \n\nNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off against the allowance for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge-offs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount. \n\nIn accordance with the Corporation&#8217;s policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not \n\nplaced on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming. \n\nCredit card and other unsecured consumer loans are cha rged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confir mation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans are charged off to their collateral values when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud. If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off. \n\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection. \n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible. \n\nThe entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer&#8217;s billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. \n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings \n\nConsumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs. \n\nLoans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 98 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nplaced on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs. \n\nSecured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the time of discharge. If these loans are contractually current, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due. \n\nA loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR. \n\nLoans Held-for-sale \n\nLoans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases. \n\nPremises and Equipment \n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements . \n\nOther Assets \n\nFor the Corporation&#8217;s financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be zero . For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are \n\nthen included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. \n\nLessee Arrangements \n\nSubstantially all of the Corporation&#8217;s lessee arrangements are operating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities . All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nThe Corporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. At lease commencement, lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Corporation&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a business segment. \n\nThe Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. \n\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. \n\nIf the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The Corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. \n\nWhen performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n99 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nwhich the reporting unit&#8217;s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance. \n\nFor intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value. \n\nVariable Interest Entities \n\nA VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing documents and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. \n\nThe Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust. \n\nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust&#8217;s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights. \n\nOther VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO. \n\nThe Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle. \n\nRetained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows. \n\nFair Value \n\nThe Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Under applicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy. \n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets. \n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes U.S. government and \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 100 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nagency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS. \n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. This category generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized. \n\nIncome tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe following summarizes the Corporation&#8217;s revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities. \n\nCard Income \n\nCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment network&#8217;s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance \n\nfor loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner&#8217;s members or customers on behalf of the Corporation. \n\nService Charges \n\nService charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation&#8217;s Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services, including account maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs. \n\nInvestment and Brokerage Services \n\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation&#8217;s financial advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client&#8217;s AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client&#8217;s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services. \n\nBrokerage fees include income earned from transaction-based services that are performed as part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the Global Wealth &#38; Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services. \n\nInvestment Banking Income \n\nInvestment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n101 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nearned for the placement of a customer&#8217;s debt or equity securities. The revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed. Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in performing these services. These expenses are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication. \n\nFinancial advisory services consist of fees earned for assisting clients with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on the size of the transaction and scope of services performed and is generally contingent on successful completion of the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client. \n\nOther Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies \n\nThe Corporation did not disclose the value of any open performance obligations at December 31, 2022, as its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice. \n\nEarnings Per Common Share \n\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested \n\ncommon shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income allocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable. \n\nForeign Currency Translation \n\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When the foreign entity&#8217;s functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 102 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 2 &#160; Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income \n\nThe table below presents the Corporation&#8217;s net interest income and noninterest income disaggregated by revenue source for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

(ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation&#8217;s derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement. \n\nThe following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance \n\nSheet at December 31, 2022 and 2021 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid. \n\nFor more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 10 &#8211; Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash . \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n105 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\nOffsetting of Derivatives (1) \n\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities (Dollars in billions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Interest rate contracts &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Over-the-counter $ 138.4 &#160; $ 132.3 &#160; $ 171.3 &#160; $ 166.3 &#160; Exchange-traded 0.4 &#160; 0.1 &#160; 0.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Over-the-counter cleared 71.4 &#160; 71.1 &#160; 22.6 &#160; 22.5 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts Over-the-counter 109.7 &#160; 110.6 &#160; 67.9 &#160; 70.5 &#160; Over-the-counter cleared 1.3 &#160; 1.2 &#160; 1.1 &#160; 1.1 &#160; Equity contracts Over-the-counter 21.5 &#160; 22.6 &#160; 29.2 &#160; 32.9 &#160; Exchange-traded 33.0 &#160; 33.8 &#160; 38.3 &#160; 38.4 &#160; Commodity contracts Over-the-counter 8.3 &#160; 9.3 &#160; 6.1 &#160; 7.6 &#160; Exchange-traded 2.4 &#160; 1.9 &#160; 1.4 &#160; 1.3 &#160; Over-the-counter cleared 0.3 &#160; 0.3 &#160; 0.1 &#160; 0.1 &#160; Credit derivatives Over-the-counter 8.9 &#160; 7.5 &#160; 5.2 &#160; 5.3 &#160; Over-the-counter cleared &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.8 &#160; 1.8 &#160; Total gross derivative assets/liabilities, before netting Over-the-counter 286.8 &#160; 282.3 &#160; 279.7 &#160; 282.6 &#160; Exchange-traded 35.8 &#160; 35.8 &#160; 39.9 &#160; 39.7 &#160; Over-the-counter cleared 73.0 &#160; 72.6 &#160; 25.6 &#160; 25.5 &#160; Less: Legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received/paid Over-the-counter ( 243.8 ) ( 248.2 ) ( 250.3 ) ( 254.6 ) Exchange-traded ( 33.5 ) ( 33.5 ) ( 37.8 ) ( 37.8 ) Over-the-counter cleared ( 72.4 ) ( 72.0 ) ( 25.0 ) ( 25.4 ) Derivative assets/liabilities, after netting 45.9 &#160; 37.0 &#160; 32.1 &#160; 30.0 &#160; Other gross derivative assets/liabilities (2) \n\n2.7 &#160; 7.8 &#160; 3.2 &#160; 7.7 &#160; Total derivative assets/liabilities 48.6 &#160; 44.8 &#160; 35.3 &#160; 37.7 &#160; Less: Financial instruments collateral (3) \n\n( 18.5 ) ( 7.4 ) ( 11.8 ) ( 10.6 ) Total net derivative assets/liabilities $ 30.1 &#160; $ 37.4 &#160; $ 23.5 &#160; $ 27.1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Over-the-counter derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a particular counterparty. Over-the-counter cleared derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a counterparty where the transaction is cleared through a clearinghouse. Exchange-traded derivatives include listed options transacted on an exchange. \n\n(2) Consists of derivatives entered into under master netting agreements where the enforceability of these agreements is uncertain under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries. \n\n(3) Amounts are limited to the derivative asset/liability balance and, accordingly, do not include excess collateral received/pledged. Financial instruments collateral includes securities collateral received or pledged and cash securities held and posted at third-party custodians that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net derivative assets and liabilities. \n\nALM and Risk Management Derivatives \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s ALM and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities. Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's ALM and risk management activities. \n\nThe Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation&#8217;s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. \n\nMarket risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes \n\nforward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. \n\nThe Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation&#8217;s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. \n\nThe Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. \n\nDerivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges \n\nThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 106 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nand other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency- \n\ndenominated debt (net investment hedges). \n\nFair Value Hedges \n\nThe table below summarizes information related to fair value hedges for 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges Derivative Hedged Item (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 \n\nInterest rate risk on long-term debt (1) \n\n$ ( 26,654 ) $ ( 7,018 ) $ 7,091 &#160; $ 26,825 &#160; $ 6,838 &#160; $ ( 7,220 ) \n\nInterest rate and foreign currency risk on long-term debt (2) \n\n( 120 ) ( 90 ) 783 &#160; 119 &#160; 79 &#160; ( 783 ) \n\nInterest rate risk on available-for-sale securities (3) \n\n21,991 &#160; 5,203 &#160; ( 44 ) ( 22,280 ) ( 5,167 ) 49 &#160; \n\nPrice risk on commodity inventory (4) \n\n674 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 674 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total $ ( 4,109 ) $ ( 1,905 ) $ 7,830 &#160; $ 3,990 &#160; $ 1,750 &#160; $ ( 7,954 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts are recorded in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\n(2) For 2022, 2021 and 2020, the derivative amount includes gains (losses) of $( 37 ) million, $( 73 ) million and $ 701 million in interest expense, $( 81 ) million, $ 0 and $ 73 million in market making and similar activities, and $( 2 ) million, $( 17 ) million and $ 9 million in accumulated OCI, respectively. Line item totals are in the Consolidated Statement of Income and on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n(3) Amounts are recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\n(4) Amounts are recorded in market making and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nThe table below summarizes the carrying value of hedged assets and liabilities that are designated and qualifying in fair value hedging relationships along with the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying value that have been recorded in the current hedging relationships. These fair value hedging adjustments are open basis adjustments that are not subject to amortization as long as the hedging relationship remains designated. \n\n##TABLE_START Designated Fair Value Hedged Assets and Liabilities December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value Cumulative \n\nFair Value \n\nAdjustments (1) \n\nCarrying Value Cumulative \n\nFair Value \n\nAdjustments (1) \n\nLong-term debt (2) \n\n$ 187,402 &#160; $ ( 21,372 ) $ 181,745 &#160; $ 3,987 &#160; \n\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities (2, 3, 4) \n\n167,518 &#160; ( 18,190 ) 209,038 &#160; ( 2,294 ) \n\nTrading account assets (5) \n\n16,119 &#160; 146 &#160; 2,067 &#160; 32 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Increase (decrease) to carrying value. \n\n(2) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the cumulative fair value adjustments remaining on long-term debt and available-for-sale debt securities from discontinued hedging relationships resulted in an increase of $ 137 million and $ 1.5 billion in the related liability and a decrease in the related asset of $ 4.9 billion and $ 1.0 billion, which are being amortized over the remaining contractual life of the de-designated hedged items. \n\n(3) These amounts include the amortized cost of the prepayable financial assets used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship (i.e. last-of-layer hedging relationship). At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $ 21.4 billion and $ 21.1 billion, of which $ 9.2 billion and $ 6.9 billion was designated in the last-of-layer hedging relationship. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the cumulative adjustment associated with these hedging relationships was a decrease of $ 451 million and $ 172 million. \n\n(4) Carrying value represents amortized cost. \n\n(5) Represents hedging activities related to certain commodities inventory. \n\nCash Flow and Net Investment Hedges \n\nThe table below summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Of the $ 11.9 billion after-tax net loss ($ 15.9 billion pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at December 31, 2022, losses of $ 4.4 billion after-tax ($ 5.9 billion pretax) related to both open and terminated cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected \n\nto primarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years . For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest income is approximately five years , with the aggregated amount beyond this time period being insignificant. \n\n##TABLE_START Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Gains (Losses) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives Gains (Losses) in Income Reclassified from Accumulated OCI (Dollars in millions, amounts pretax) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Cash flow hedges Interest rate risk on variable-rate portfolios (1) \n\n$ ( 13,492 ) $ ( 2,686 ) $ 763 &#160; $ ( 338 ) $ 148 &#160; $ ( 7 ) Price risk on forecasted MBS purchases (1) \n\n( 129 ) ( 249 ) 241 &#160; 11 &#160; 26 &#160; 9 &#160; Price risk on certain compensation plans (2) \n\n( 88 ) 93 &#160; 85 &#160; 29 &#160; 55 &#160; 12 &#160; Total $ ( 13,709 ) $ ( 2,842 ) $ 1,089 &#160; $ ( 298 ) $ 229 &#160; $ 14 &#160; Net investment hedges Foreign exchange risk (3) \n\n$ 1,710 &#160; $ 1,451 &#160; $ ( 834 ) $ 3 &#160; $ 23 &#160; $ 4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\n(2) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\n(3) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for 2022, 2021 and 2020. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense recorded on the hedged item. \n\n##TABLE_START Gains and Losses on Other Risk Management Derivatives (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest rate risk on mortgage activities (1, 2) \n\n$ ( 326 ) $ ( 18 ) $ 611 &#160; \n\nCredit risk on loans (2) \n\n( 37 ) ( 25 ) ( 68 ) Interest rate and foreign currency risk on asset and liability management activities (3) \n\n4,713 &#160; 1,757 &#160; ( 2,971 ) Price risk on certain compensation plans (4) \n\n( 1,073 ) 917 &#160; 700 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes hedges of interest rate risk on MSRs and IRLCs to originate mortgage loans that will be held for sale. \n\n(2) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in other income. \n\n(3) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in market making and similar activities. \n\n(4) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in compensation and benefits expense. \n\nTransfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through Derivatives \n\nThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had transferred $ 4.8 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 4.9 billion and $ 4.8 billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the transferred securities was $ 4.7 billion and $ 5.0 billion. \n\nSales and Trading Revenue \n\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation&#8217;s Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items, including market making and similar activities and net interest income as well as other revenue categories. \n\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the &#8220;Other&#8221; column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in market making and similar activities. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in market making and similar activities. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer \n\nservices for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market making and similar activities as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in market making and similar activities. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income. \n\nThe table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation&#8217;s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets , categorized by primary risk, for 2022, 2021 and 2020. This table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses).

Includes investment and brokerage services revenue of $ 2.0 billion, $ 1.9 billion and $ 1.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n(2) Includes commodity risk. \n\nCredit Derivatives \n\nThe Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 108 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\noccurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount. \n\nCredit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation \n\ndiscloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments. \n\nCredit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are summarized in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START Credit Derivative Instruments Less than One Year One to Three Years Three to Five Years Over Five Years Total December 31, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value Credit default swaps: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment grade $ 2 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 133 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 194 &#160; Non-investment grade 120 &#160; 516 &#160; 870 &#160; 697 &#160; 2,203 &#160; Total 122 &#160; 541 &#160; 1,003 &#160; 731 &#160; 2,397 &#160; Total return swaps/options: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment grade 55 &#160; 336 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 391 &#160; Non-investment grade 332 &#160; 9 &#160; 132 &#160; 10 &#160; 483 &#160; Total 387 &#160; 345 &#160; 132 &#160; 10 &#160; 874 &#160; Total credit derivatives $ 509 &#160; $ 886 &#160; $ 1,135 &#160; $ 741 &#160; $ 3,271 &#160; Credit-related notes: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment grade $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 1,017 &#160; $ 1,036 &#160; Non-investment grade &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; 6 &#160; 1,035 &#160; 1,048 &#160; Total credit-related notes $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 2,052 &#160; $ 2,084 &#160; &#160; Maximum Payout/Notional Credit default swaps: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment grade $ 34,670 &#160; $ 66,170 &#160; $ 93,237 &#160; $ 18,677 &#160; $ 212,754 &#160; Non-investment grade 15,229 &#160; 29,629 &#160; 30,891 &#160; 6,662 &#160; 82,411 &#160; Total 49,899 &#160; 95,799 &#160; 124,128 &#160; 25,339 &#160; 295,165 &#160; Total return swaps/options: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment grade 38,722 &#160; 10,407 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 49,129 &#160; Non-investment grade 32,764 &#160; 500 &#160; 2,054 &#160; 897 &#160; 36,215 &#160; Total 71,486 &#160; 10,907 &#160; 2,054 &#160; 897 &#160; 85,344 &#160; Total credit derivatives $ 121,385 &#160; $ 106,706 &#160; $ 126,182 &#160; $ 26,236 &#160; $ 380,509 &#160; December 31, 2021 Carrying Value Credit default swaps: Investment grade $ &#8212; &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 79 &#160; $ 49 &#160; $ 133 &#160; Non-investment grade 34 &#160; 250 &#160; 453 &#160; 769 &#160; 1,506 &#160; Total 34 &#160; 255 &#160; 532 &#160; 818 &#160; 1,639 &#160; Total return swaps/options: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment grade 35 &#160; 388 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 423 &#160; Non-investment grade 105 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 121 &#160; Total 140 &#160; 388 &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 544 &#160; Total credit derivatives $ 174 &#160; $ 643 &#160; $ 548 &#160; $ 818 &#160; $ 2,183 &#160; Credit-related notes: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment grade $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 412 &#160; $ 448 &#160; Non-investment grade 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; 1,334 &#160; 1,348 &#160; Total credit-related notes $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 45 &#160; $ 1,746 &#160; $ 1,796 &#160; &#160; Maximum Payout/Notional Credit default swaps: Investment grade $ 34,503 &#160; $ 66,334 &#160; $ 73,444 &#160; $ 17,844 &#160; $ 192,125 &#160; Non-investment grade 16,119 &#160; 29,233 &#160; 34,356 &#160; 7,961 &#160; 87,669 &#160; Total 50,622 &#160; 95,567 &#160; 107,800 &#160; 25,805 &#160; 279,794 &#160; Total return swaps/options: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment grade 49,626 &#160; 11,494 &#160; 78 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 61,198 &#160; Non-investment grade 22,621 &#160; 717 &#160; 642 &#160; 73 &#160; 24,053 &#160; Total 72,247 &#160; 12,211 &#160; 720 &#160; 73 &#160; 85,251 &#160; Total credit derivatives $ 122,869 &#160; $ 107,778 &#160; $ 108,520 &#160; $ 25,878 &#160; $ 365,045 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable \n\nindicator of the Corporation&#8217;s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits. \n\nCredit-related notes in the preceding table include investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n109 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nobligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned. \n\nCredit-related Contingent Features and Collateral \n\nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page 105, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\nCertain of the Corporation&#8217;s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation&#8217;s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $ 101.3 billion and $ 91.4 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $ 81.2 billion and $ 79.3 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements. \n\nIn connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $ 3.2 billion, including $ 1.6 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA). \n\nSome counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant. \n\nThe following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by \n\nderivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2022 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch. The table also presents derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties upon downgrade of the Corporation's or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt ratings. \n\n##TABLE_START Additional Collateral Required to be Posted and Derivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade at December 31, 2022 (Dollars in millions) One Incremental Notch Second Incremental Notch Additional collateral required to be posted upon downgrade Bank of America Corporation $ 230 &#160; $ 913 &#160; \n\nBank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries (1) \n\n66 &#160; 668 &#160; Derivative liabilities subject to unilateral termination upon downgrade Derivative liabilities $ 92 &#160; $ 1,073 &#160; Collateral posted 77 &#160; 300 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table. \n\nValuation Adjustments on Derivatives \n\nThe Corporation records credit risk valuation adjustments on derivatives in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparties and its own credit quality. The Corporation calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. CDS spread data is used to estimate the default probabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures. Where no observable credit default data is available for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity. \n\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related hedge activities), which are recorded in market making and similar activities, for 2022, 2021 and 2020. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative liabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. FVA losses have the opposite impact. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nValuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on Derivatives (1) \n\n(Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Derivative assets (CVA) $ ( 80 ) $ 208 &#160; $ ( 118 ) Derivative assets/liabilities (FVA) \n\n125 &#160; ( 2 ) ( 24 ) Derivative liabilities (DVA) 194 &#160; 3 &#160; 24 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, cumulative CVA reduced the derivative assets balance by $ 518 million, $ 438 million and $ 646 million, cumulative FVA reduced the net derivative balance by $ 54 million, $ 179 million and $ 177 million, and cumulative DVA reduced the derivative liabilities balance by $ 506 million, $ 312 million and $ 309 million, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 110 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 4 Securities \n\nThe table below presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of AFS debt securities, other debt securities carried at fair value and HTM debt securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Debt Securities Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Available-for-sale debt securities Mortgage-backed securities: Agency $ 25,204 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ ( 1,767 ) $ 23,442 &#160; $ 45,268 &#160; $ 1,257 &#160; $ ( 186 ) $ 46,339 &#160; Agency-collateralized mortgage obligations 2,452 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 231 ) 2,221 &#160; 3,331 &#160; 74 &#160; ( 25 ) 3,380 &#160; Commercial 6,894 &#160; 28 &#160; ( 515 ) 6,407 &#160; 19,036 &#160; 647 &#160; ( 79 ) 19,604 &#160; Non-agency residential (1) \n\n461 &#160; 15 &#160; ( 90 ) 386 &#160; 591 &#160; 25 &#160; ( 33 ) 583 &#160; Total mortgage-backed securities 35,011 &#160; 48 &#160; ( 2,603 ) 32,456 &#160; 68,226 &#160; 2,003 &#160; ( 323 ) 69,906 &#160; U.S. Treasury and government agencies 160,773 &#160; 18 &#160; ( 1,769 ) 159,022 &#160; 197,853 &#160; 1,610 &#160; ( 318 ) 199,145 &#160; Non-U.S. securities 13,455 &#160; 4 &#160; ( 52 ) 13,407 &#160; 11,933 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,933 &#160; Other taxable securities 4,728 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 84 ) 4,645 &#160; 2,725 &#160; 39 &#160; ( 3 ) 2,761 &#160; Tax-exempt securities 11,518 &#160; 19 &#160; ( 279 ) 11,258 &#160; 15,155 &#160; 317 &#160; ( 39 ) 15,433 &#160; Total available-for-sale debt securities 225,485 &#160; 90 &#160; ( 4,787 ) 220,788 &#160; 295,892 &#160; 3,969 &#160; ( 683 ) 299,178 &#160; \n\nOther debt securities carried at fair value (2) \n\n8,986 &#160; 376 &#160; ( 156 ) 9,206 &#160; 8,873 &#160; 105 &#160; ( 83 ) 8,895 &#160; Total debt securities carried at fair value 234,471 &#160; 466 &#160; ( 4,943 ) 229,994 &#160; 304,765 &#160; 4,074 &#160; ( 766 ) 308,073 &#160; Held-to-maturity debt securities Agency mortgage-backed securities 503,233 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 87,319 ) 415,914 &#160; 553,721 &#160; 3,855 &#160; ( 10,366 ) 547,210 &#160; U.S. Treasury and government agencies 121,597 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 20,259 ) 101,338 &#160; 111,859 &#160; 254 &#160; ( 2,395 ) 109,718 &#160; Other taxable securities 8,033 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1,018 ) 7,015 &#160; 9,011 &#160; 147 &#160; ( 196 ) 8,962 &#160; Total held-to-maturity debt securities 632,863 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 108,596 ) 524,267 &#160; 674,591 &#160; 4,256 &#160; ( 12,957 ) 665,890 &#160; Total debt securities (3,4) \n\n$ 867,334 &#160; $ 466 &#160; $ ( 113,539 ) $ 754,261 &#160; $ 979,356 &#160; $ 8,330 &#160; $ ( 13,723 ) $ 973,963 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the underlying collateral type included approximately 17 percent and 21 percent prime and 83 percent and 79 percent subprime. \n\n(2) Primarily includes non-U.S. securities used to satisfy certain international regulatory requirements.

All of these loans are individually insured, and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans. \n\nNonperforming Loans and Leases \n\nCommercial nonperforming loans decreased to $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2022 from $ 1.6 billion at December 31, 2021, as paydowns and returns to performing status more than offset new downgrades to nonaccrual status. Consumer nonperforming loans decreased to $ 2.8 billion at December 31, 2022 from \n\n$ 3.0 billion at December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans whose prior-period deferrals expired and were modified in TDRs during the first quarter of 2022. \n\nThe following table presents the Corporation&#8217;s nonperforming loans and leases, including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.

For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the Corporation&#8217;s loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower&#8217;s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a \n\nprimary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans. \n\nThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans that were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 116 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Residential Mortgage &#8211;

Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased to $ 19.3 billion at December 31, 2022 from $ 22.4 billion (to 3.12 percent from 3.91 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2021, which was broad-based across industries. \n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings \n\nConsumer Real Estate \n\nModifications of consumer real estate loans are classified as TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been granted. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof. Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification. \n\nConsumer real estate loans of $ 211 million that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in \n\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were included in TDRs at December 31, 2022, of which $ 53 million were classified as nonperforming and $ 33 million were loans fully insured. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $ 121 million and $ 101 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 871 million and $ 1.1 billion. During 2022 and 2021, the Corporation reclassified $ 190 million and $ 64 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets.

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer&#8217;s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation \n\nagencies that provide solutions to customers&#8217; entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. \n\nThe table below provides information on the Corporation&#8217;s Credit Card and Other Consumer TDR portfolio including the December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of loans that were modified in TDRs during 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Credit Card and Other Consumer &#8211; TDRs Entered into During 2022, 2021 and 2020 &#160; Unpaid Principal Balance Carrying Value (1) \n\nPre-Modification Interest Rate Post-Modification Interest Rate (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 Credit card $ 284 &#160; $ 293 &#160; 22.34 &#160; % 3.89 &#160; % Direct/Indirect consumer 6 &#160; 5 &#160; 5.51 &#160; 5.50 &#160; Total $ 290 &#160; $ 298 &#160; 22.06 &#160; 3.92 &#160; December 31, 2021 Credit card $ 237 &#160; $ 248 &#160; 18.45 &#160; % 4.09 &#160; % Direct/Indirect consumer 23 &#160; 16 &#160; 5.88 &#160; 5.88 &#160; Total $ 260 &#160; $ 264 &#160; 17.68 &#160; 4.20 &#160; December 31, 2020 Credit card $ 269 &#160; $ 277 &#160; 18.16 &#160; % 5.63 &#160; % Direct/Indirect consumer 52 &#160; 37 &#160; 5.83 &#160; 5.83 &#160; Total $ 321 &#160; $ 314 &#160; 16.70 &#160; 5.65 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes accrued interest and fees. \n\nThe table below presents the December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 carrying value for Credit Card and Other Consumer loans that were modified in a TDR during 2022, 2021 and 2020 by program type. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nCredit Card and Other Consumer &#8211; TDRs by Program Type at December 31 (1) \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n2022 2021 2020 Internal programs $ 251 &#160; $ 214 &#160; $ 225 &#160; External programs \n\n44 &#160; 44 &#160; 73 &#160; Other \n\n3 &#160; 6 &#160; 16 &#160; Total $ 298 &#160; $ 264 &#160; $ 314 &#160; ##TABLE_END (1) Includes accrued interest and fees. \n\nCredit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 15 percent of new credit card TDRs and 15 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification. \n\nCommercial Loans \n\nModifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation&#8217;s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation&#8217;s risk exposure. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 122 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nReductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan. \n\nAt the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. \n\nDuring 2022, the carrying value of the Corporation&#8217;s commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $ 1.9 billion compared to $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.2 billion for 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had commitments to lend $ 358 million, $ 283 million and $ 402 million to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $ 105 million, $ 262 million and $ 218 million at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nLoans Held-for-sale \n\nThe Corporation had LHFS of $ 6.9 billion and $ 15.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were $ 32.0 billion, $ 43.6 billion and $ 20.1 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled $ 24.9 billion, $ 37.3 billion and $ 19.7 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $ 1.9 billion during 2022, primarily driven by the transfer of a $ 1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to held for sale that was sold in October 2022, and $ 808 million during 2021. \n\nAccrued Interest Receivable \n\nAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 3.8 billion and $ 2.2 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nOutstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud . During 2022 and 2021, the Corporation reversed $ 332 million and $ 446 million of interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan. \n\nFor the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during 2022 and 2021, interest and fee income reversed at the time the loans were classified as nonperforming was not significant. For more information on the Corporation's nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nThe allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in \n\nthe quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . \n\nThe December 31, 2022 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook is weighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in 2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower GDP and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be above five and a half percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and will slowly decline to five percent by the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product is forecasted to contract at 0.4 percent and grow at 1.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. For comparison, as of December 31, 2021, the weighted economic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted to be just above five percent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly decline to just under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and U.S. gross domestic product was forecasted at 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 was $ 14.2 billion, an increase of $ 379 million compared to December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties. The change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net increase of $ 295 million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an increase of $ 84 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to increases in the credit card and other consumer portfolios of $ 341 million, and commercial portfolio of $ 177 million, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer real estate portfolio of $ 139 million. The provision for credit losses increased $ 7.1 billion to an expense of $ 2.5 billion in 2022 compared to a benefit of $ 4.6 billion in 2021 and an expense of $ 11.3 billion in 2020. The increase in the provision for credit losses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced pandemic uncertainties. The benefit in 2021 was primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. \n\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $ 68.7 billion in 2022 primarily driven by commercial loans, which increased $ 47.7 billion, driven by broad-based growth, and consumer loans which \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n123 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nincreased $ 21.0 billion, primarily driven by credit card and residential mortgage. \n\nThe changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START Consumer Real Estate Credit Card and Other Consumer Commercial Total (Dollars in millions) 2022 Allowance for loan and lease losses, January 1 $ 557 &#160; $ 6,476 &#160; $ 5,354 &#160; $ 12,387 &#160; Loans and leases charged off ( 206 ) ( 2,755 ) ( 478 ) ( 3,439 ) Recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off 224 &#160; 882 &#160; 161 &#160; 1,267 &#160; Net charge-offs 18 &#160; ( 1,873 ) ( 317 ) ( 2,172 ) Provision for loan and lease losses ( 164 ) 2,215 &#160; 409 &#160; 2,460 &#160; Other 9 &#160; ( 1 ) ( 1 ) 7 &#160; Allowance for loan and lease losses, December 31 \n\n420 &#160; 6,817 &#160; 5,445 &#160; 12,682 &#160; Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, January 1 96 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,360 &#160; 1,456 &#160; Provision for unfunded lending commitments ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; 86 &#160; 83 &#160; Other 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, December 31 \n\n94 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,446 &#160; 1,540 &#160; Allowance for credit losses, December 31 \n\n$ 514 &#160; $ 6,817 &#160; $ 6,891 &#160; $ 14,222 &#160; 2021 Allowance for loan and lease losses, January 1 $ 858 &#160; $ 9,213 &#160; $ 8,731 &#160; $ 18,802 &#160; Loans and leases charged off ( 78 ) ( 3,000 ) ( 719 ) ( 3,797 ) Recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off 225 &#160; 1,006 &#160; 323 &#160; 1,554 &#160; Net charge-offs 147 &#160; ( 1,994 ) ( 396 ) ( 2,243 ) Provision for loan and lease losses ( 449 ) ( 744 ) ( 2,980 ) ( 4,173 ) Other 1 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 1 ) 1 &#160; Allowance for loan and lease losses, December 31 \n\n557 &#160; 6,476 &#160; 5,354 &#160; 12,387 &#160; Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, January 1 137 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,741 &#160; 1,878 &#160; Provision for unfunded lending commitments ( 41 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 380 ) ( 421 ) Other &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, December 31 \n\n96 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,360 &#160; 1,456 &#160; Allowance for credit losses, December 31 \n\n$ 653 &#160; $ 6,476 &#160; $ 6,714 &#160; $ 13,843 &#160; 2020 Allowance for loan and lease losses, January 1 $ 440 &#160; $ 7,430 &#160; $ 4,488 &#160; $ 12,358 &#160; Loans and leases charged off ( 98 ) ( 3,646 ) ( 1,675 ) ( 5,419 ) Recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off 201 &#160; 891 &#160; 206 &#160; 1,298 &#160; Net charge-offs 103 &#160; ( 2,755 ) ( 1,469 ) ( 4,121 ) Provision for loan and lease losses 307 &#160; 4,538 &#160; 5,720 &#160; 10,565 &#160; Other 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 8 ) &#8212; &#160; Allowance for loan and lease losses, December 31 858 &#160; 9,213 &#160; 8,731 &#160; 18,802 &#160; Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, January 1 119 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,004 &#160; 1,123 &#160; Provision for unfunded lending commitments 18 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 737 &#160; 755 &#160; Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, December 31 137 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,741 &#160; 1,878 &#160; Allowance for credit losses, December 31 $ 995 &#160; $ 9,213 &#160; $ 10,472 &#160; $ 20,680 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities \n\nThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its own and its customers&#8217; financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s use of VIEs, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. \n\nThe tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation \n\notherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation&#8217;s maximum loss exposure at December 31, 2022 and 2021 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation&#8217;s maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation&#8217;s maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets. \n\nThe Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 &#8211; Securities or Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection with its funding activities. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 124 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so. \n\nThe Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $ 978 million and $ 968 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nFirst-lien Mortgage Securitizations \n\nAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA- \n\ninsured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described in Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. \n\nThe table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START First-lien Mortgage Securitizations &#160; Residential Mortgage - Agency Commercial Mortgage (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 \n\nProceeds from loan sales (1) \n\n$ 8,084 &#160; $ 6,664 &#160; $ 15,823 &#160; $ 5,853 &#160; $ 10,874 &#160; $ 5,084 &#160; \n\nGains on securitizations (2) \n\n8 &#160; 9 &#160; 728 &#160; 46 &#160; 156 &#160; 61 &#160; Repurchases from securitization trusts (3) \n\n53 &#160; 756 &#160; 436 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and primarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange. Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt. \n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 41 million, $ 121 million and $ 160 million net of hedges, during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are not included in the table above. \n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities. \n\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $ 100.1 billion and $ 115.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 274 million, $ 392 million and $ 474 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $ 1.6 billion and $ 2.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies . \n\n(2) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $ 3.3 billion and $ 4.3 billion of seller&#8217;s interest. \n\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 126 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nHome Equity Loans \n\nThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. \n\nCredit Card Securitizations \n\nThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation&#8217;s continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller&#8217;s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts. \n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation issued new senior debt securities to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust totaling $ 2.3 billion, $ 1.0 billion, and $ 1.0 billion, respectively. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $ 6.7 billion and $ 6.5 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the credit card securitization trust issued $ 363 million, $ 161 million and $ 161 million, respectively, of these subordinate securities. \n\nResecuritization Trusts \n\nThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. \n\nThe Corporation resecuritized $ 21.8 billion, $ 28.9 billion and $ 39.0 billion of securities during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair value of $ 2.4 billion, $ 2.2 billion and $ 6.1 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the securities were classified as trading account assets. All of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading account assets. Of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during 2020, $ 2.4 billion, $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.7 billion were classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively. Substantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nMunicipal Bond Trusts \n\nThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $ 2.5 billion and $ 4.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2022 was 8.7 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nOther Variable Interest Entities \n\nThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Other VIEs Consolidated Unconsolidated Total Consolidated Unconsolidated Total (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Maximum loss exposure $ 2,286 &#160; $ 31,405 &#160; $ 33,691 &#160; $ 4,819 &#160; $ 27,790 &#160; $ 32,609 &#160; On-balance sheet assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Trading account assets $ 353 &#160; $ 638 &#160; $ 991 &#160; $ 2,552 &#160; $ 626 &#160; $ 3,178 &#160; Debt securities carried at fair value &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; 7 &#160; Loans and leases 2,086 &#160; 90 &#160; 2,176 &#160; 2,503 &#160; 47 &#160; 2,550 &#160; Allowance for loan and lease losses ( 1 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 2 ) ( 12 ) ( 14 ) All other assets 46 &#160; 30,221 &#160; 30,267 &#160; 28 &#160; 26,628 &#160; 26,656 &#160; Total $ 2,484 &#160; $ 30,942 &#160; $ 33,426 &#160; $ 5,081 &#160; $ 27,296 &#160; $ 32,377 &#160; On-balance sheet liabilities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term borrowings $ 42 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 42 &#160; $ 51 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 51 &#160; Long-term debt 156 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 156 &#160; 211 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 211 &#160; All other liabilities &#8212; &#160; 7,318 &#160; 7,318 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6,548 &#160; 6,548 &#160; Total $ 198 &#160; $ 7,318 &#160; $ 7,516 &#160; $ 262 &#160; $ 6,548 &#160; $ 6,810 &#160; Total assets of VIEs $ 2,484 &#160; $ 101,271 &#160; $ 103,755 &#160; $ 5,081 &#160; $ 92,249 &#160; $ 97,330 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n127 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCustomer VIEs \n\nCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $ 914 million and $ 2.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation&#8217;s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. \n\nCollateralized Debt Obligation VIEs \n\nThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation&#8217;s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $ 197 million and $ 235 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nInvestment VIEs \n\nThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $ 854 million and $ 1.0 billion. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $ 12.2 billion and $ 7.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Corporation&#8217;s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $ 2.4 billion and $ 2.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities. \n\nLeveraged Lease Trusts \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation&#8217;s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. \n\nTax Credit VIEs \n\nThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. As an investor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities are allocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are recognized as income tax benefits in the Corporation&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned, \n\nwhich varies based on the type of investments. Tax credits from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments in affordable housing are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and tax credits from wind and solar energy investments are recognized either at inception for transactions electing Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced for transactions electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which is generally up to a 10-year time period. The volume and types of investments held by the Corporation will influence the amount of tax credits recognized each period. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $ 28.8 billion and $ 25.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In addition to that amount, the Corporation had unfunded capital contributions for renewable energy investments of $ 1.9 billion and $ 1.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The capital contributions are contingent on various conditions precedent to funding over the next two years . The Corporation&#8217;s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $ 14.1 billion and $ 12.6 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $ 6.6 billion and $ 5.8 billion, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years . During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $ 1.5 billion, $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.2 billion and reported pretax losses in other income of $ 1.2 billion, $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion. These tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation&#8217;s annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. The Corporation may be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant. \n\nNOTE 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill \n\nThe table below presents goodwill balances by business segment at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment testing are the operating segments or one level below. \n\n##TABLE_START Goodwill December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Consumer Banking $ 30,137 &#160; $ 30,137 &#160; Global Wealth &#38; Investment Management 9,677 &#160; 9,677 &#160; Global Banking 24,026 &#160; 24,026 &#160; Global Markets 5,182 &#160; 5,182 &#160; Total goodwill $ 69,022 &#160; $ 69,022 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring 2022, the Corporation completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2022 using qualitative assessments for all applicable reporting units. Based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Corporation determined there was no impairment. For more information on the use of qualitative assessments, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . \n\nIntangible Assets \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net carrying value of intangible assets was $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.2 billion. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, intangible assets included $ 1.6 \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 128 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nbillion of intangible assets associated with trade names, substantially all of which had an indefinite life and, accordingly, are not being amortized. Amortization of intangibles expense was $ 78 million, $ 76 million and $ 95 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nNOTE 8 Leases \n\nThe Corporation enters into both lessor and lessee arrangements. For more information on lease accounting, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and on lease financing receivables, see Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses . \n\nLessor Arrangements \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s lessor arrangements primarily consist of operating, sales-type and direct financing leases for equipment. Lease agreements may include options to renew and for the lessee to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. \n\nThe table below presents the net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nNet Investment (1) \n\nDecember 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Lease receivables $ 15,123 &#160; $ 16,806 &#160; Unguaranteed residuals 2,143 &#160; 2,078 &#160; Total net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases $ 17,266 &#160; $ 18,884 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) In certain cases, the Corporation obtains third-party residual value insurance to reduce its residual asset risk. The carrying value of residual assets with third-party residual value insurance for at least a portion of the asset value was $ 6.5 billion and $ 7.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nThe table below presents lease income for 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Lease Income (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Sales-type and direct financing leases $ 589 &#160; $ 613 &#160; $ 707 &#160; Operating leases 941 &#160; 930 &#160; 931 &#160; Total lease income $ 1,530 &#160; $ 1,543 &#160; $ 1,638 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nLessee Arrangements \n\nThe Corporation's lessee arrangements predominantly consist of operating leases for premises and equipment; the Corporation's financing leases are not significant. \n\nLease terms may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features. Generally, these options do not impact the lease term because the Corporation is not reasonably certain that it will exercise the options. \n\nThe following table provides information on the right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and weighted-average discount rates and lease terms at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Supplemental Information for Lessee Arrangements December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Right-of-use asset $ 9,755 &#160; $ 10,233 &#160; Lease liabilities 10,359 &#160; 10,858 &#160; Weighted-average discount rate used to calculate present value of future minimum lease payments 3.25 &#160; % 2.91 &#160; % Weighted-average lease term (in years) 8.6 9.0 \n\nRight-of-use assets obtained in \n\nexchange for new operating \n\nlease liabilities (1) \n\n$ 824 &#160; $ 1,713 &#160; 2022 2021 2020 \n\nOperating cash flows from \n\noperating leases (2) \n\n$ 1,986 &#160; $ 1,964 &#160; $ 2,039 &#160; Lease Cost and Supplemental Information: Operating lease cost $ 2,008 &#160; $ 2,025 &#160; $ 2,149 &#160; \n\nVariable lease cost (3) \n\n464 &#160; 462 &#160; 474 &#160; \n\nTotal lease cost (4) \n\n$ 2,472 &#160; $ 2,487 &#160; $ 2,623 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents non-cash activity and, accordingly, is not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\n(2) Represents cash paid for amounts included in the measurements of lease liabilities. \n\n(3) Primarily consists of payments for common area maintenance and property taxes. \n\n(4) Amounts are recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nMaturity Analysis \n\nThe maturities of lessor and lessee arrangements outstanding at December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below based on undiscounted cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START Maturities of Lessor and Lessee Arrangements Lessor Lessee (1) \n\nOperating Leases Sales-type and \n\nDirect Financing \n\nLeases (2) \n\nOperating Leases (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 2023 $ 819 &#160; $ 4,932 &#160; $ 1,998 &#160; 2024 682 &#160; 4,399 &#160; 1,850 &#160; 2025 509 &#160; 2,539 &#160; 1,567 &#160; 2026 368 &#160; 1,993 &#160; 1,354 &#160; 2027 289 &#160; 990 &#160; 1,131 &#160; Thereafter 664 &#160; 1,635 &#160; 4,189 &#160; Total undiscounted \n\ncash flows \n\n$ 3,331 &#160; 16,488 &#160; 12,089 &#160; Less: Net present \n\nvalue adjustment \n\n1,365 &#160; 1,730 &#160; Total (3) \n\n$ 15,123 &#160; $ 10,359 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes $ 278 million in commitments under lessee arrangements that have not yet commenced with lease terms that will begin in 2023. \n\n(2) Includes $ 10.2 billion in commercial lease financing receivables and $ 4.9 billion in direct/indirect consumer lease financing receivables. \n\n(3) Represents lease receivables for lessor arrangements and lease liabilities for lessee arrangements. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n129 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 9 Deposits \n\nThe scheduled contractual maturities for total time deposits at December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nContractual Maturities of Total Time Deposits \n\n(Dollars in millions) U.S. Non-U.S. Total Due in 2023 $ 36,114 &#160; $ 7,393 &#160; $ 43,507 &#160; Due in 2024 3,576 &#160; 67 &#160; 3,643 &#160; Due in 2025 643 &#160; 6 &#160; 649 &#160; Due in 2026 149 &#160; 23 &#160; 172 &#160; Due in 2027 116 &#160; 1,472 &#160; 1,588 &#160; Thereafter 238 &#160; 8 &#160; 246 &#160; Total time deposits $ 40,836 &#160; $ 8,969 &#160; $ 49,805 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had aggregate U.S. time deposits of $ 12.8 billion and $ 9.4 billion and non-U.S. time deposits of $ 9.0 billion and $ 10.6 billion in denominations that met or exceeded insurance limits. \n\nNOTE 10 Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash \n\nThe Corporation enters into securities financing agreements which include securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These financing agreements (also referred to as &#8220;matched-book transactions&#8221;) are to accommodate customers, obtain securities to cover short positions and finance inventory positions. The Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements under the fair value option. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Option . \n\nOffsetting of Securities Financing Agreements \n\nSubstantially all of the Corporation&#8217;s securities financing activities are transacted under legally enforceable master \n\nrepurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities lending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date. \n\nThe Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements.

For securities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. To determine whether the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may receive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. \n\nShort-term Bank Notes \n\nBank of America, N.A. maintains a global program to offer up to a maximum of $ 75.0 billion outstanding at any one time, of bank notes with fixed or floating rates and maturities of at least seven days from the date of issue. Short-term bank notes outstanding under this program totaled $ 6.2 billion and $ 1.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These short-term bank notes, along with Federal Home Loan Bank advances, U.S. \n\nTreasury tax and loan notes, and term federal funds purchased, are included in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nCollateral \n\nThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of this collateral was $ 827.6 billion and $ 854.8 billion, of which $ 764.1 billion and $ 782.7 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell. \n\nThe Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nIn certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of Consolidated VIEs. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n131 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on provisions contained in master netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative assets. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative \n\nliabilities. For more information on the collateral of derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives. \n\nRestricted Cash \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation held restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $ 7.6 billion and $ 5.9 billion, predominantly related to cash segregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with central banks to meet reserve requirements. \n\nNOTE 11 Long-term Debt \n\nLong-term debt consists of borrowings having an original maturity of one year or more. The table below presents the balance of long-term debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related contractual rates and maturity dates as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Weighted-average Rate December 31 (Dollars in millions) Interest Rates Maturity Dates 2022 2021 \n\nNotes issued by Bank of America Corporation (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; Senior notes: &#160; &#160; Fixed 3.03 % 0.25 - 8.05 \n\n% 2023 - 2052 \n\n$ 188,429 &#160; $ 194,191 &#160; Floating 4.2 0.74 - 9.16 \n\n2023 - 2044 \n\n17,469 &#160; 18,753 &#160; Senior structured notes 11,608 &#160; 15,086 &#160; Subordinated notes: Fixed 4.88 2.94 - 8.57 \n\n2024 - 2045 \n\n21,098 &#160; 22,311 &#160; Floating 3.45 2.48 - 5.53 \n\n2026 - 2037 \n\n4,544 &#160; 2,371 &#160; Junior subordinated notes: Fixed 6.71 6.45 - 8.05 \n\n2027 - 2066 \n\n743 &#160; 741 &#160; Floating 5.56 5.56 2056 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Total notes issued by Bank of America Corporation 243,892 &#160; 253,454 &#160; Notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. &#160; &#160; Senior notes: &#160; &#160; Fixed &#8212; &#160; 501 &#160; Floating 5.05 &#160; 5.05 \n\n2,600 &#160; 3,173 &#160; Subordinated notes 6.00 6.00 2036 1,485 &#160; 1,780 &#160; Advances from Federal Home Loan Banks: Fixed 4.49 0.01 - 7.42 \n\n2023 - 2034 \n\n681 &#160; 290 &#160; \n\nSecuritizations and other BANA VIEs (2) \n\n4,300 &#160; 3,338 &#160; Other 908 &#160; 680 &#160; Total notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. 9,974 &#160; 9,762 &#160; Other debt &#160; &#160; \n\nStructured liabilities (3) \n\n21,835 &#160; 16,599 &#160; \n\nNonbank VIEs (2) \n\n281 &#160; 249 &#160; Other &#8212; &#160; 53 &#160; Total notes issued by nonbank and other entities 22,116 &#160; 16,901 &#160; Total long-term debt $ 275,982 &#160; $ 280,117 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes total loss-absorbing capacity compliant debt. \n\n(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated VIEs included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For more information, see Note 6 &#8211; Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities. \n\n(3) Includes debt outstanding of $ 8.0 billion and $ 5.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 that was issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, the parent company, and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent company. \n\nDuring 2022, the Corporation issued $ 66.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $ 44.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 10.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $ 11.8 billion of other debt. During 2021, the Corporation issued $ 76.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $ 56.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 8.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $ 12.5 billion of other debt. \n\nDuring 2022, the Corporation had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $ 33.3 billion consisting of $ 19.8 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $ 9.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 3.6 billion of other debt. During 2021, the Corporation had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $ 46.4 billion consisting of $ 24.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $ 10.4 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 11.6 billion of other debt. \n\nBank of America Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various U.S. and non-U.S. debt programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of foreign currency-denominated debt translated into U.S. dollars included in total long-term debt was $ 46.7 billion and $ 53.1 billion. Foreign currency contracts may be used to convert certain foreign currency-denominated debt into U.S. dollars. \n\nThe weighted-average effective interest rates for total long-term debt (excluding senior structured notes), total fixed-rate debt and total floating-rate debt were 3.27 percent, 3.23 percent and 4.14 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2022, and 2.83 percent, 3.08 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2021. The Corporation&#8217;s ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 132 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCorporation&#8217;s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse effect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions. \n\nThe table below shows the carrying value for aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2022. Included in the table are certain structured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put \n\noptions) at specified dates prior to maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a referenced index or security. In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the table as maturing at their contractual maturity date. \n\n##TABLE_START Long-term Debt by Maturity (Dollars in millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Bank of America Corporation Senior notes $ 8,029 &#160; $ 22,570 &#160; $ 24,730 &#160; $ 23,972 &#160; $ 16,055 &#160; $ 110,542 &#160; $ 205,898 &#160; Senior structured notes 767 &#160; 456 &#160; 558 &#160; 946 &#160; 641 &#160; 8,240 &#160; 11,608 &#160; Subordinated notes &#8212; &#160; 3,205 &#160; 5,132 &#160; 4,908 &#160; 2,155 &#160; 10,242 &#160; 25,642 &#160; Junior subordinated notes &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 188 &#160; 556 &#160; 744 &#160; Total Bank of America Corporation 8,796 &#160; 26,231 &#160; 30,420 &#160; 29,826 &#160; 19,039 &#160; 129,580 &#160; 243,892 &#160; Bank of America, N.A.

These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nCredit Extension Commitments \n\nThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $ 10.4 billion and $ 10.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The carrying value of the Corporation&#8217;s credit extension commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, excluding commitments accounted for under \n\nthe fair value option, was $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.5 billion, which predominantly related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower&#8217;s ability to pay. \n\nThe following table includes the notional amount of commitments of $ 3.0 billion and $ 4.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair value for these commitments of $ 110 million and $ 97 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation&#8217;s loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Option. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n133 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Credit Extension Commitments Expire in One Year or Less Expire After One Year Through Three Years Expire After Three Years Through Five Years Expire After Five Years Total (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 Notional amount of credit extension commitments &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loan commitments (1) \n\n$ 113,962 &#160; $ 162,890 &#160; $ 221,374 &#160; $ 13,667 &#160; $ 511,893 &#160; Home equity lines of credit 1,479 &#160; 7,230 &#160; 11,578 &#160; 22,154 &#160; 42,441 &#160; Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees (2) \n\n22,565 &#160; 9,237 &#160; 2,787 &#160; 628 &#160; 35,217 &#160; Letters of credit 853 &#160; 46 &#160; 52 &#160; 49 &#160; 1,000 &#160; Other commitments (3) \n\n5 &#160; 93 &#160; 71 &#160; 1,103 &#160; 1,272 &#160; Legally binding commitments 138,864 &#160; 179,496 &#160; 235,862 &#160; 37,601 &#160; 591,823 &#160; Credit card lines (4) \n\n419,144 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 419,144 &#160; Total credit extension commitments $ 558,008 &#160; $ 179,496 &#160; $ 235,862 &#160; $ 37,601 &#160; $ 1,010,967 &#160; &#160; December 31, 2021 Notional amount of credit extension commitments &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loan commitments (1) \n\n$ 102,464 &#160; $ 190,687 &#160; $ 174,978 &#160; $ 26,635 &#160; $ 494,764 &#160; Home equity lines of credit 890 &#160; 5,097 &#160; 10,268 &#160; 24,276 &#160; 40,531 &#160; Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees (2) \n\n22,359 &#160; 10,742 &#160; 2,017 &#160; 422 &#160; 35,540 &#160; Letters of credit 1,145 &#160; 124 &#160; 56 &#160; 98 &#160; 1,423 &#160; Other commitments (3) \n\n18 &#160; 59 &#160; 81 &#160; 1,233 &#160; 1,391 &#160; Legally binding commitments 126,876 &#160; 206,709 &#160; 187,400 &#160; 52,664 &#160; 573,649 &#160; Credit card lines (4) \n\n406,169 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 406,169 &#160; Total credit extension commitments $ 533,045 &#160; $ 206,709 &#160; $ 187,400 &#160; $ 52,664 &#160; $ 979,818 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 2.6 billion and $ 4.6 billion of these loan commitments were held in the form of a security. \n\n(2) The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial guarantees classified as investment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference name within the instrument were $ 25.1 billion and $ 9.5 billion at December 31, 2022, and $ 26.3 billion and $ 8.7 billion at December 31, 2021. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 575 million and $ 512 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value guarantees. \n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit. \n\nOther Commitments \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $ 636 million and $ 181 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $ 294 million and $ 518 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $ 0 and $ 949 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets. \n\nAt both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $ 92.0 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $ 57.8 billion and $ 32.6 billion as of both period ends. These commitments generally expire within the next 12 months. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $ 3.7 billion and $ 4.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $ 571 million and $ 395 million. \n\nOther Guarantees \n\nBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection \n\nThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 4.3 \n\nbillion and $ 6.3 billion. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $ 632 million and $ 928 million, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. \n\nIndemnifications \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of any early termination clauses. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote. \n\nMerchant Services \n\nThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 134 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\npayment network rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was approximately $ 501 billion, is an estimate of the Corporation&#8217;s maximum potential exposure as of December 31, 2022. The Corporation&#8217;s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation&#8217;s reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant. \n\nExchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees \n\nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. The Corporation&#8217;s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the Corporation&#8217;s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. The Corporation&#8217;s maximum potential exposure under these membership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the probability of making any such payments as remote. \n\nPrime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services \n\nIn connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement services with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation&#8217;s obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in the clients&#8217; accounts and the accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients or their customers. The Corporation&#8217;s maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote. \n\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo Program \n\nThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&#8217;s rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation&#8217;s guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation&#8217;s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $ 59.6 billion and $ 42.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nOther Guarantees \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions. \n\nGuarantees of Certain Long-term Debt \n\nThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation. \n\nRepresentations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees \n\nThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide indemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases). \n\nUnresolved Repurchase Claims \n\nUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments. \n\nThe notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 5.5 billion and $ 8.4 billion. These balances included $ 2.2 billion and $ 2.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid. \n\nDuring 2022, the Corporation received $ 82 million in new repurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2022, $ 3.0 billion in claims were resolved. \n\nReserve and Related Provision \n\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $ 612 million and $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation&#8217;s best estimate \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n135 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nof probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation. \n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter. \n\nAs a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters below, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation and regulatory investigation-related expense of $ 1.2 billion and $ 164 million was recognized in 2022 and 2021. \n\nFor any matter disclosed in this Note for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation&#8217;s estimated range of possible loss is $ 0 to $ 0.8 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation&#8217;s maximum loss exposure. \n\nInformation is provided below regarding the nature of the litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages. Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of those matters could be \n\nmaterial to the Corporation&#8217;s business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm. \n\nDeposit Insurance Assessment \n\nOn January 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (&#8220;District Court&#8221;) alleging failure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance assessments and interest in the amount of $ 542 million for the quarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014. \n\nOn April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the amount of $ 583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on BANA&#8217;s alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those quarters, and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error. BANA disagrees with the FDIC&#8217;s interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDIC&#8217;s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018, the District Court denied BANA&#8217;s partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDIC&#8217;s claims. On January 24, 2023, the magistrate judge assigned to the matter by the District Court judge held oral argument on the parties&#8217; motions for summary judgment and took the motions under advisement. \n\nLIBOR \n\nThe Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities have been named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial instruments as a result of collusion or manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety of claims, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and injunctive relief. All but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (&#8220;District Court&#8221;). The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and dismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of America entities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has also substantially limited the scope of antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing in their entirety certain individual and putative class plaintiffs&#8217; antitrust claims for lack of standing. On December 30, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of these antitrust claims for lack of standing. Certain individual and putative class actions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities.

At December 31, 2022, the Corporation had reserved 491 million unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, convertible notes and preferred stock. \n\nPreferred Stock \n\nThe cash dividends declared on preferred stock were $ 1.6 billion in 2022 and $ 1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020. \n\nOn January 25, 2022, the Corporation issued 70,000 shares of 4.375 % Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series RR for $ 1.8 billion, with quarterly dividends commencing in April 2022. The Series RR preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $ 25,000 per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends. \n\nOn January 31, 2022 the Corporation issued 28,000 shares of 4.750 % Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series SS for $ 700 million, with quarterly dividends commencing in May 2022. The Series SS preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $ 25,000 per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends. \n\nOn April 22, 2022, the Corporation issued 80,000 shares of 6.125 % Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series TT for $ 2.0 billion, with quarterly dividends commencing in July 2022. The Series TT preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $ 25,000 per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends. \n\nThrough a cash tender offer announced and completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Corporation partially repurchased Series E, Series FF, Series HH, Series JJ, Series KK, Series LL, Series MM, Series NN, Series PP, Series QQ, Series RR, Series SS, Series 1 and Series 5 preferred stock with a total carrying value of $ 737 million for $ 654 million in cash, with $ 83 million recognized in additional paid-in capital as a preferred stock benefit. \n\nAll series of preferred stock in the Preferred Stock Summary table have a par value of $ 0.01 per share, are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund, have no participation rights, and with the exception of the Series L Preferred Stock, are not convertible. The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series 1 through 5 Preferred Stock have general voting rights and vote together with the common stock. The holders of the other series included in the table have no general voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporation&#8217;s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation&#8217;s assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. With the exception of the Series B, F and G Preferred Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether consecutive or not), the holders of these series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a single class) will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors. These voting rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full dividends on these series for at least two semi-annual or four quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage. \n\nThe 7.25 % Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does not have early redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20 shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds 130 percent of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the Corporation will still pay any accrued dividends payable. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n137 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe table below presents a summary of perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2022 . \n\n##TABLE_START Preferred Stock Summary \n\n(Dollars in millions, except as noted) Series Description Initial Issuance Date Total Shares Outstanding Liquidation Preference per Share (in dollars) Carrying Value Per Annum Dividend Rate Dividend per Share \n\n(in dollars) (1) \n\nAnnual Dividend Redemption Period (2) \n\nSeries B &#160; 7.000 % Cumulative Redeemable \n\nJune 1997 7,076 &#160; $ 100 &#160; $ 1 &#160; 7.00 &#160; % $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; n/a \n\nSeries E (3) \n\nFloating Rate Non-Cumulative November 2006 12,317 &#160; 25,000 &#160; 308 &#160; 3-mo.

As a financial holding company, the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the Federal Reserve. The Corporation&#8217;s banking entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC. \n\nThe Corporation and its primary banking entity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its \n\nbanking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. \n\nThe Corporation is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Corporation&#8217;s insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. \n\nThe table below presents capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Corporation and BANA. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRegulatory Capital under Basel 3 \n\nBank of America Corporation Bank of America, N.A.

The Corporation&#8217;s stress capital buffer applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach was 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, the Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and the Corporation&#8217;s capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent or the SCB, as applicable, of 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. \n\n(3) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are the minimum ratios under Basel 3, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends are the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. \n\n(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. \n\n(5) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 140 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe capital adequacy rules issued by the U.S. banking regulators require institutions to meet the established minimums outlined in the table above. Failure to meet the minimum requirements can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation&#8217;s financial position. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates were well capitalized. \n\nOther Regulatory Matters \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $ 5.6 billion and $ 4.0 billion, and securities with a fair value of $ 16.6 billion and $ 10.6 billion that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations. Cash and cash equivalents segregated in compliance with securities regulations are a component of restricted cash. For more information, see Note 10 &#8211; Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash . In addition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations of $ 20.7 billion and $ 28.6 billion primarily recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nBank Subsidiary Distributions \n\nThe primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received from its bank subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of America California, N.A. In 2022, the Corporation received dividends of $ 22.0 billion from BANA and $ 250 million from Bank of America California, N.A. \n\nThe amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank&#8217;s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years . Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period. In 2023, BANA can declare and pay dividends of approximately $ 16.1 billion to the Corporation plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2023 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. Bank of America California, N.A. can pay dividends of $ 173 million in 2023 plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2023 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. \n\nNOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans \n\nPension and Postretirement Plans \n\nThe Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans and postretirement health and life plans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. \n\npension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the country and local practices. \n\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-selected investments, applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively provides principal protection for participant balances transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature. \n\nBenefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn investment credits or interest credits in accordance with the terms of the plan document. \n\nThe Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension plan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from actual experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The Corporation made no contribution under this agreement in 2022 or 2021. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees. \n\nIn addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits-eligible employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. \n\nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The estimate of the Corporation&#8217;s PBO associated with these plans considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the plans. The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2022 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of $ 5.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2021 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of approximately $ 895 million at December 31, 2021. Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2022 and 2021 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n141 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\nPension and Postretirement Plans (1) \n\nQualified Pension Plan Non-U.S. Pension Plans Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans Postretirement Health and Life Plans (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Fair value, January 1 $ 22,078 &#160; $ 21,776 &#160; $ 3,031 &#160; $ 3,078 &#160; $ 2,585 &#160; $ 2,789 &#160; $ 117 &#160; $ 143 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 3,896 ) 1,215 &#160; ( 898 ) 62 &#160; ( 332 ) ( 55 ) 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Company contributions (withdrawals) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 30 &#160; 24 &#160; ( 135 ) 87 &#160; 45 &#160; 38 &#160; Plan participant contributions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 104 &#160; 107 &#160; Settlements and curtailments &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 51 ) ( 11 ) ( 6 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Benefits paid ( 924 ) ( 913 ) ( 62 ) ( 84 ) ( 226 ) ( 236 ) ( 161 ) ( 171 ) Federal subsidy on benefits paid n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency exchange rate changes n/a n/a ( 323 ) ( 39 ) n/a n/a n/a n/a Fair value, December 31 $ 17,258 &#160; $ 22,078 &#160; $ 1,728 &#160; $ 3,031 &#160; $ 1,886 &#160; $ 2,585 &#160; $ 107 &#160; $ 117 &#160; Change in projected benefit obligation &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Projected benefit obligation, January 1 $ 15,676 &#160; $ 16,427 &#160; $ 3,116 &#160; $ 3,340 &#160; $ 2,753 &#160; $ 3,005 &#160; $ 928 &#160; $ 1,007 &#160; Service cost &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 29 &#160; 28 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; 5 &#160; Interest cost 438 &#160; 414 &#160; 53 &#160; 45 &#160; 74 &#160; 67 &#160; 25 &#160; 24 &#160; Plan participant contributions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 104 &#160; 107 &#160; Plan amendments &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Settlements and curtailments &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 51 ) ( 11 ) ( 6 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Actuarial loss (gain) ( 3,610 ) ( 252 ) ( 1,054 ) ( 152 ) ( 486 ) ( 83 ) ( 198 ) ( 44 ) Benefits paid ( 924 ) ( 913 ) ( 62 ) ( 84 ) ( 226 ) ( 236 ) ( 161 ) ( 171 ) Federal subsidy on benefits paid n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency exchange rate changes n/a n/a ( 283 ) ( 51 ) n/a n/a ( 2 ) &#8212; &#160; Projected benefit obligation, December 31 $ 11,580 &#160; $ 15,676 &#160; $ 1,752 &#160; $ 3,116 &#160; $ 2,109 &#160; $ 2,753 &#160; $ 700 &#160; $ 928 &#160; Amounts recognized on Consolidated Balance Sheet Other assets $ 5,678 &#160; $ 6,402 &#160; $ 370 &#160; $ 550 &#160; $ 495 &#160; $ 777 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Accrued expenses and other liabilities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 394 ) ( 635 ) ( 718 ) ( 945 ) ( 593 ) ( 811 ) Net amount recognized, December 31 $ 5,678 &#160; $ 6,402 &#160; $ ( 24 ) $ ( 85 ) $ ( 223 ) $ ( 168 ) $ ( 593 ) $ ( 811 ) Funded status, December 31 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accumulated benefit obligation $ 11,580 &#160; $ 15,676 &#160; $ 1,694 &#160; $ 3,031 &#160; $ 2,109 &#160; $ 2,753 &#160; n/a n/a Overfunded (unfunded) status of ABO 5,678 &#160; 6,402 &#160; 34 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 223 ) ( 168 ) n/a n/a Provision for future salaries &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 58 &#160; 85 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; n/a n/a Projected benefit obligation 11,580 &#160; 15,676 &#160; 1,752 &#160; 3,116 &#160; 2,109 &#160; 2,753 &#160; $ 700 &#160; $ 928 &#160; Weighted-average assumptions, December 31 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate 5.54 &#160; % 2.86 &#160; % 4.59 &#160; % 1.85 &#160; % 5.58 &#160; % 2.80 &#160; % 5.56 &#160; % 2.85 &#160; % Rate of compensation increase n/a n/a 4.25 &#160; 4.46 &#160; 4.00 &#160; 4.00 &#160; n/a n/a Interest-crediting rate 5.36 &#160; % 4.83 &#160; % 2.03 &#160; 1.90 &#160; 4.69 &#160; 4.22 &#160; n/a n/a ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The measurement date for all of the above plans was December 31 of each year reported. \n\nn/a = not applicable \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s estimate of its contributions to be made to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans in 2023 is $ 26 million, $ 89 million and $ 22 million, respectively.

Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was determined using the &#8220;projected unit credit&#8221; actuarial method. For the Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50 percent of the unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis during the year. \n\nAssumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is 6.50 percent for 2023, reducing in steps to 5.00 percent in 2028 and later years. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans is sensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bp decline in discount rates and expected return on assets would not have had a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost for 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Pretax Amounts included in Accumulated OCI and OCI &#160; Qualified Pension Plan Non-U.S. Pension Plans Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans Postretirement Health and Life Plans Total (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net actuarial loss (gain) $ 4,775 &#160; $ 3,425 &#160; $ 312 &#160; $ 456 &#160; $ 796 &#160; $ 945 &#160; $ ( 187 ) $ 4 &#160; $ 5,696 &#160; $ 4,830 &#160; Prior service cost (credits) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 43 &#160; 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) ( 3 ) 42 &#160; 14 &#160; Amounts recognized in accumulated OCI $ 4,775 &#160; $ 3,425 &#160; $ 355 &#160; $ 473 &#160; $ 796 &#160; $ 945 &#160; $ ( 188 ) $ 1 &#160; $ 5,738 &#160; $ 4,844 &#160; Current year actuarial loss (gain) $ 1,490 &#160; $ ( 294 ) $ ( 107 ) $ ( 154 ) $ ( 95 ) $ 21 &#160; $ ( 198 ) $ ( 41 ) $ 1,090 &#160; $ ( 468 ) \n\nAmortization of actuarial gain (loss) and \n\nprior service cost \n\n( 140 ) ( 193 ) ( 14 ) ( 19 ) ( 54 ) ( 63 ) 9 &#160; ( 20 ) ( 199 ) ( 295 ) Current year prior service cost (credit) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Amounts recognized in OCI $ 1,350 &#160; $ ( 487 ) $ ( 118 ) $ ( 173 ) $ ( 149 ) $ ( 42 ) $ ( 189 ) $ ( 61 ) $ 894 &#160; $ ( 763 ) ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n143 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nPlan Assets \n\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement vehicle for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits promised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The Corporation&#8217;s policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The Corporation&#8217;s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment measures. \n\nThe assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan&#8217;s assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plans&#8217; liabilities. The selected asset \n\nallocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy. \n\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds&#8217; past experience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration of the plan&#8217;s obligations. \n\nThe target allocations for 2023 by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $ 296 million ( 1.72 percent of total plan assets) and $ 398 million ( 1.80 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Target Allocation Percentage Asset Category Qualified Pension Plan Non-U.S. Pension Plans Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans Equity securities 15 - 50 % \n\n0 - 20 % \n\n0 - 5 % \n\nDebt securities 45 - 80 % \n\n40 - 75 % \n\n95 - 100 % \n\nReal estate 0 - 10 % \n\n0 - 15 % \n\n0 - 5 % \n\nOther 0 - 5 % \n\n10 - 40 % \n\n0 - 5 % \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Corporation, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements .

The Corporation recorded expense of $ 1.2 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to the qualified defined contribution plans. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, 179 million and 173 million shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock were held by these plans. Payments to the plans for dividends on common stock were $ 153 million, $ 139 million and $ 138 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nCertain non-U.S. employees are covered under defined contribution pension plans that are separately administered in accordance with local laws. \n\nNOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation Plans \n\nThe Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan (BACEP). Under this plan, 715 million shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock are authorized to be used for grants of awards. \n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Corporation granted 102 million and 99 million RSU awards to certain employees under the BACEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock up to the settlement date. The RSUs granted in 2022 will generally vest over four years . Of the RSUs granted in 2021, 81 million will generally vest over four years and 18 million will vest over three years . The four-year awards vest primarily in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date while the three-year awards vest primarily in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2022 and 2021 that vest over four years , 39 million and 27 million do not include retirement eligibility. For all other RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible, they are deemed authorized as of the beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $ 2.9 billion, $ 3.0 billion and $ 2.1 billion, and the related income tax benefit was $ 697 million, $ 723 million and $ 505 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, there was an estimated $ 3.6 billion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to certain share-based compensation awards that is expected to be recognized over a period of up to four years , with a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. \n\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units \n\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 3.4 billion, $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.3 billion, respectively. The table below presents the status at December 31, 2022 of the share-settled restricted stock and restricted stock units and changes during 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Stock-settled Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units Shares/Units Weighted- average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at January 1, 2022 185,050,842 &#160; $ 31.54 &#160; Granted 100,108,395 &#160; 46.10 &#160; Vested ( 73,288,792 ) 30.85 &#160; Canceled ( 9,310,647 ) 39.80 &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2022 202,559,798 &#160; 38.60 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTE 19 Income Taxes \n\nThe components of income tax expense for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START Income Tax Expense (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current income tax expense &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. federal $ 1,157 &#160; $ 1,076 &#160; $ 1,092 &#160; U.S. state and local 389 &#160; 775 &#160; 1,076 &#160; Non-U.S. 1,156 &#160; 985 &#160; 670 &#160; Total current expense 2,702 &#160; 2,836 &#160; 2,838 &#160; Deferred income tax expense &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. federal 110 &#160; 962 &#160; ( 799 ) U.S. state and local 254 &#160; 491 &#160; ( 233 ) Non-U.S. 375 &#160; ( 2,291 ) ( 705 ) Total deferred expense 739 &#160; ( 838 ) ( 1,737 ) Total income tax expense $ 3,441 &#160; $ 1,998 &#160; $ 1,101 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of items that are included in OCI each period.

A reconciliation of the expected U.S. federal income tax expense, calculated by applying the federal statutory tax rate, to the Corporation&#8217;s actual income tax expense, and the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 146 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense &#160; Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Expected U.S. federal income tax expense $ 6,504 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 7,135 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 3,989 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from: State tax expense, net of federal benefit 756 &#160; 2.4 &#160; 1,087 &#160; 3.2 &#160; 728 &#160; 3.8 &#160; Affordable housing/energy/other credits ( 3,698 ) ( 11.9 ) ( 3,795 ) ( 11.2 ) ( 2,869 ) ( 15.1 ) Tax-exempt income, including dividends ( 273 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 352 ) ( 1.0 ) ( 346 ) ( 1.8 ) Changes in prior-period UTBs, including interest ( 273 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 155 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 41 ) ( 0.2 ) Rate differential on non-U.S. earnings 368 &#160; 1.2 &#160; 45 &#160; 0.1 &#160; 218 &#160; 1.1 &#160; Nondeductible expenses 352 &#160; 1.1 &#160; 206 &#160; 0.6 &#160; 324 &#160; 1.7 &#160; Tax law changes 186 &#160; 0.6 &#160; ( 2,050 ) ( 6.0 ) ( 699 ) ( 3.7 ) Other ( 481 ) ( 1.5 ) ( 123 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 203 ) ( 1.0 ) Total income tax expense $ 3,441 &#160; 11.1 &#160; % $ 1,998 &#160; 5.9 &#160; % $ 1,101 &#160; 5.8 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nTax Law changes reflect the impact of the 2022, 2021 and 2020 U.K. enacted corporate income tax rate changes, which resulted in a negative tax adjustment of approximately $ 186 million in 2022 and positive income tax adjustments of approximately $ 2.0 billion and $ 700 million in 2021 and 2020, with corresponding adjustments of U.K. net deferred tax assets. The U.K. net deferred tax assets are primarily net operating losses (NOLs), incurred by the Corporation&#8217;s U.K. broker-dealer entity in historical periods, which do not expire under U.K. tax law and are assessed regularly for impairment. If further U.K. tax law changes are enacted, a corresponding income tax adjustment will be made based on the amount of available net deferred tax assets and applicable tax rate changes. \n\nTax credits originate from ESG investments in affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships and similar entities. Significant increases in the tax credits recognized over the last three annual periods have been primarily driven by the Corporation&#8217;s continued growth in the volume of investments in wind and solar energy production facilities, consistent with the Corporation&#8217;s commitment to support the transition to a lower carbon economy.

Included in the UTB balance are some items the recognition of which would not affect the effective tax rate, such as the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated federal deduction and the portion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that would be offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions. \n\nIt is reasonably possible that the UTB balance may decrease by as much as $ 375 million during the next 12 months, since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or recognition. \n\nThe Corporation recognized an interest benefit of $ 50 million in 2022 and interest expense of $ 32 million and $ 9 million in 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes, net of taxes and remittances, was $ 107 million and $ 167 million. \n\nThe Corporation files income tax returns in more than 100 state and non-U.S. jurisdictions each year. The IRS and other tax authorities in countries and states in which the Corporation has significant business operations examine tax returns periodically (continuously in some jurisdictions). The table below summarizes the status of examinations by major jurisdiction for the Corporation and various subsidiaries at December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Tax Examination Status Years under \n\nExamination (1) \n\nStatus at December 31 2022 United States 2017-2021 Field Examination California 2012-2014 Appeals California 2015-2017 Field Examination California 2018-2020 To begin in 2023 New York 2019-2021 To begin in 2023 \n\nUnited Kingdom (2) \n\n2019-2020 Field Examination ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) All tax years subsequent to the years shown remain subject to examination. \n\n(2) Field examination for tax year 2021 to begin in 2023. \n\nSignificant components of the Corporation&#8217;s net deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n147 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities &#160; December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets &#160; &#160; Net operating loss carryforwards $ 9,029 &#160; $ 9,360 &#160; Security, loan and debt valuations 4,788 &#160; 2,746 &#160; Allowance for credit losses 3,503 &#160; 3,097 &#160; Lease liability 2,443 &#160; 2,508 &#160; Employee compensation and retirement benefits 1,625 &#160; 1,392 &#160; Accrued expenses 1,143 &#160; 1,626 &#160; Available-for-sale securities 960 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Credit carryforwards 769 &#160; 705 &#160; Other 1,371 &#160; 1,160 &#160; Gross deferred tax assets 25,631 &#160; 22,594 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 2,133 ) ( 1,988 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 23,498 &#160; 20,606 &#160; &#160; &#160; Deferred tax liabilities Equipment lease financing 2,432 &#160; 3,083 &#160; Right-of-use asset 2,303 &#160; 2,358 &#160; ESG-related tax credit investments 1,759 &#160; 1,387 &#160; Fixed Assets 1,200 &#160; 2,082 &#160; Available-for-sale securities &#8212; &#160; 1,016 &#160; Other 2,459 &#160; 1,527 &#160; Gross deferred tax liabilities 10,153 &#160; 11,453 &#160; Net deferred tax assets $ 13,345 &#160; $ 9,153 &#160; ##TABLE_END The table below summarizes the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances recognized for the net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Net Operating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforward Deferred Tax Assets (Dollars in millions) Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance Net Deferred Tax Asset First Year Expiring Net operating losses - U.K. (1) \n\n$ 7,661 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7,661 &#160; None Net operating losses - other non-U.S. \n\n331 &#160; ( 147 ) 184 &#160; Various Net operating losses - U.S. states (2) \n\n1,036 &#160; ( 627 ) 409 &#160; Various Foreign tax credits 769 &#160; ( 769 ) &#8212; &#160; After 2028 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents U.K. broker-dealer net operating losses that may be carried forward indefinitely. \n\n(2) The net operating losses and related valuation allowances for U.S. states before considering the benefit of federal deductions were $ 1.3 billion and $ 794 million. \n\nManagement concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets related to the U.K. NOL carryforwards and U.S. federal and certain state NOL carryforwards since estimated future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their expiration. The majority of the Corporation&#8217;s U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management&#8217;s conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for the relevant entities and the indefinite period to carry forward NOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could lead management to reassess such valuation allowance conclusions. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, U.S. federal income taxes had not been provided on approximately $ 5.0 billion of temporary differences associated with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If the Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability, the amount would be approximately $ 1.0 billion. \n\nNOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements \n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Option. \n\nValuation Techniques \n\nThe following sections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation&#8217;s assets and liabilities. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. \n\nDuring 2022, there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities \n\nThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management&#8217;s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market&#8217;s perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 148 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nprincipally from reviewing the issuer&#8217;s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies. \n\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities \n\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation&#8217;s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data. \n\nLoans and Loan Commitments \n\nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower. \n\nMortgage Servicing Rights \n\nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. \n\nLoans Held-for-sale \n\nThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation&#8217;s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables. \n\nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt \n\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market. \n\nSecurities Financing Agreements \n\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. \n\nDeposits \n\nThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market. \n\nAsset-backed Secured Financings \n\nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation&#8217;s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n149 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRecurring Fair Value \n\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021, including financial instruments that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 &#160;

Commercial loans, debt securities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-linked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option. \n\nThe Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs, and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques. \n\nThe levels of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories. \n\nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from Unobservable Inputs \n\nLoans and Securities \n\nA significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A significant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value for long positions, and short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. \n\nStructured Liabilities and Derivatives \n\nFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a \n\nprotection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument. \n\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. \n\nFor equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would have resulted in a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value. \n\nNonrecurring Fair Value \n\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the reporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \n\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in millions) Level 2 Level 3 Level 2 Level 3 Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; Loans held-for-sale $ 1,979 &#160; $ 3,079 &#160; $ 634 &#160; $ 24 &#160; Loans and leases (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 166 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 213 &#160; Foreclosed properties (2, 3) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Other assets 88 &#160; 165 &#160; 256 &#160; 2,046 &#160; Gains (Losses) 2022 2021 2020 Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; Loans held-for-sale $ ( 387 ) $ ( 44 ) $ ( 79 ) Loans and leases (1) \n\n( 48 ) ( 60 ) ( 73 ) Foreclosed properties ( 6 ) ( 2 ) ( 6 ) Other assets ( 91 ) ( 492 ) ( 98 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes $ 15 million, $ 24 million and $ 30 million of losses on loans that were written down to a collateral value of zero during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n(2) Amounts are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the carrying value of foreclosed properties that were written down subsequent to their initial classification as foreclosed properties.

Lending commitments are actively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation&#8217;s public side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as accounting hedges and are carried at fair value. The fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management&#8217;s view of the underlying economics and the manner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the credit derivatives at fair value. \n\nLoans Held-for-sale \n\nThe Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the fair value option. These loans are actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may be mitigated through the use of derivatives. The Corporation has elected not to designate the derivatives as qualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are carried at \n\nfair value. The changes in fair value of the loans are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value option primarily because these loans are floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative instruments. \n\nLoans Reported as Trading Account Assets \n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option. \n\nOther Assets \n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin loans that are hedged with derivatives under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value. \n\nSecurities Financing Agreements \n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option. These elections include certain agreements collateralized by the U.S. government and its agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n157 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLong-term Deposits \n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives. \n\nShort-term Borrowings \n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis. \n\nThe Corporation also elects to account for certain asset-backed secured financings, which are also classified in short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting \n\nvolatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value. \n\nLong-term Debt \n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term debt, primarily structured liabilities, under the fair value option. This long-term debt is either risk-managed on a fair value basis or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting. \n\nFair Value Option Elections \n\nThe following tables provide information about the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Option Elections \n\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in millions) \n\nFair Value Carrying Amount Contractual Principal Outstanding Fair Value Carrying Amount Less Unpaid Principal Fair Value Carrying Amount Contractual Principal Outstanding Fair Value Carrying Amount Less Unpaid Principal Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell \n\n$ 146,999 &#160; $ 147,158 &#160; $ ( 159 ) $ 150,665 &#160; $ 150,677 &#160; $ ( 12 ) \n\nLoans reported as trading account assets (1) \n\n10,143 &#160; 17,682 &#160; ( 7,539 ) 10,864 &#160; 18,895 &#160; ( 8,031 ) Trading inventory &#8211; other 20,770 &#160; n/a n/a 21,986 &#160; n/a n/a Consumer and commercial loans 5,771 &#160; 5,897 &#160; ( 126 ) 7,819 &#160; 7,888 &#160; ( 69 ) \n\nLoans held-for-sale (1) \n\n1,115 &#160; 1,873 &#160; ( 758 ) 4,455 &#160; 5,343 &#160; ( 888 ) Other assets 620 &#160; n/a n/a 544 &#160; n/a n/a Long-term deposits 311 &#160; 381 &#160; ( 70 ) 408 &#160; 401 &#160; 7 &#160; Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase \n\n151,708 &#160; 151,885 &#160; ( 177 ) 139,641 &#160; 139,682 &#160; ( 41 ) Short-term borrowings 832 &#160; 833 &#160; ( 1 ) 4,279 &#160; 4,127 &#160; 152 &#160; Unfunded loan commitments 110 &#160; n/a n/a 97 &#160; n/a n/a Accrued expenses and other liabilities 1,217 &#160; 1,161 &#160; 56 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long-term debt 33,070 &#160; 36,830 &#160; ( 3,760 ) 29,708 &#160; 30,903 &#160; ( 1,195 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) A significant portion of the loans reported as trading account assets and LHFS are distressed loans that were purchased at a deep discount to par, and the remainder are loans with a fair value near contractual principal outstanding. \n\nn/a = not applicable \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 158 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gains (Losses) Related to Assets and Liabilities Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option Market making and similar activities Other Income Total (Dollars in millions) 2022 Loans reported as trading account assets $ ( 164 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 164 ) \n\nTrading inventory &#8211; other (1) \n\n( 1,159 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 1,159 ) Consumer and commercial loans ( 58 ) ( 27 ) ( 85 ) \n\nLoans held-for-sale (2) \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 304 ) ( 304 ) Short-term borrowings 639 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 639 &#160; Unfunded loan commitments &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; 8 &#160; Accrued expenses and other liabilities 11 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11 &#160; \n\nLong-term debt (3) \n\n4,359 &#160; ( 46 ) 4,313 &#160; \n\nOther (4) \n\n74 &#160; 30 &#160; 104 &#160; Total $ 3,702 &#160; $ ( 339 ) $ 3,363 &#160; 2021 Loans reported as trading account assets $ 275 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 275 &#160; \n\nTrading inventory &#8211; other (1) \n\n( 211 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 211 ) Consumer and commercial loans 78 &#160; 40 &#160; 118 &#160; \n\nLoans held-for-sale (2) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 58 &#160; 58 &#160; Short-term borrowings 883 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 883 &#160; \n\nLong-term debt (3) \n\n( 604 ) ( 41 ) ( 645 ) \n\nOther (4) \n\n18 &#160; ( 23 ) ( 5 ) Total $ 439 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 473 &#160; 2020 Loans reported as trading account assets $ 107 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 107 &#160; \n\nTrading inventory &#8211; other (1) \n\n3,216 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,216 &#160; Consumer and commercial loans 22 &#160; ( 3 ) 19 &#160; \n\nLoans held-for-sale (2) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 103 &#160; 103 &#160; Short-term borrowings ( 170 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 170 ) Unfunded loan commitments &#8212; &#160; ( 65 ) ( 65 ) \n\nLong-term debt (3) \n\n( 2,175 ) ( 53 ) ( 2,228 ) \n\nOther (4) \n\n35 &#160; ( 22 ) 13 &#160; Total $ 1,035 &#160; $ ( 40 ) $ 995 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The gains (losses) in market making and similar activities are primarily offset by (losses) gains on trading liabilities that hedge these assets. \n\n(2) Includes the value of IRLCs on funded loans, including those sold during the period. \n\n(3) The net gains (losses) in market making and similar activities relate to the embedded derivatives in structured liabilities and are typically offset by (losses) gains on derivatives and securities that hedge these liabilities.

Certain loans, deposits, long-term debt, unfunded lending commitments and other financial instruments are accounted for under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Option . The following disclosures include financial instruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion of the ending balance is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nShort-term Financial Instruments \n\nThe carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, certain time deposits placed and other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased, certain resale and repurchase agreements and short-term \n\nborrowings, approximates the fair value of these instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market. The Corporation accounts for certain resale and repurchase agreements under the fair value option. \n\nUnder the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1. Time deposits placed and other short-term investments, such as U.S. government securities and short-term commercial paper, are classified as Level 1 or Level 2. Federal funds sold and purchased are classified as Level 2. Resale and repurchase agreements are classified as Level 2 because they are generally short-dated and/or variable-rate instruments collateralized by U.S. government or agency securities. Short-term borrowings are classified as Level 2. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n159 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nThe carrying values and fair values by fair value hierarchy of certain financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance was carried at fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nFair Value Carrying Value Level 2 Level 3 Total (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 Financial assets Loans \n\n$ 1,014,593 &#160; $ 50,194 &#160; $ 935,282 &#160; $ 985,476 &#160; Loans held-for-sale 6,871 &#160; 3,417 &#160; 3,455 &#160; 6,872 &#160; Financial liabilities Deposits (1) \n\n1,930,341 &#160; 1,930,165 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,930,165 &#160; Long-term debt 275,982 &#160; 271,993 &#160; 1,136 &#160; 273,129 &#160; Commercial unfunded lending commitments (2) \n\n1,650 &#160; 77 &#160; 6,596 &#160; 6,673 &#160; December 31, 2021 Financial assets Loans \n\n$ 946,142 &#160; $ 53,544 &#160; $ 919,980 &#160; $ 973,524 &#160; Loans held-for-sale 15,635 &#160; 15,016 &#160; 627 &#160; 15,643 &#160; Financial liabilities Deposits (1) \n\n2,064,446 &#160; 2,064,438 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,064,438 &#160; Long-term debt 280,117 &#160; 286,802 &#160; 1,288 &#160; 288,090 &#160; Commercial unfunded lending commitments (2) \n\n1,554 &#160; 97 &#160; 6,384 &#160; 6,481 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes demand deposits of $ 918.9 billion and $ 1.0 trillion with no stated maturities at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n(2) The carrying value of commercial unfunded lending commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation does not estimate the fair value of consumer unfunded lending commitments because, in many instances, the Corporation can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing notice to the borrower. For more information on commitments, see Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies . \n\nNOTE 23 &#160; Business Segment Information \n\nThe Corporation reports its results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth &#38; Investment Management, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . \n\nConsumer Banking \n\nConsumer Banking offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. Consumer Banking product offerings include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and products, as well as credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans to consumers and small businesses in the U.S. Consumer Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans. \n\nGlobal Wealth &#38; Investment Management \n\nGWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets, including tailored solutions to meet clients&#8217; needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients&#8217; wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services. \n\nGlobal Banking \n\nGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services through the Corporation&#8217;s network of offices and client relationship teams. Global Banking also provides investment banking products to clients. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking clients generally include middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations, financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions. \n\nGlobal Markets \n\nGlobal Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets also works with commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products. As a result of market-making activities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products. In addition, the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. \n\nAll Other \n\nAll Other primarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to the business segments. \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nThe management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. \n\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of the Corporation&#8217;s ALM activities. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 160 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nvarious derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation&#8217;s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a majority of the Corporation&#8217;s ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities.

The non-U.S. business activities are largely conducted in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and in Asia. The Corporation identifies its geographic performance based on the business unit structure used to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region \n\nas applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the allocation of revenue so that revenue can be appropriately matched with the related capital or expense deployed in the region. Certain asset, liability, income and expense amounts have been allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net of interest expense, income before income taxes and net income by geographic area as presented below. \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Total Assets at Year End (1) \n\nTotal Revenue, Net of Interest Expense (2) \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes Net Income \n\nU.S. (3) \n\n2022 $ 2,631,815 &#160; $ 82,890 &#160; $ 28,135 &#160; $ 25,607 &#160; &#160; 2021 2,789,862 &#160; 78,012 &#160; 31,392 &#160; 27,781 &#160; &#160; 2020 75,576 &#160; 18,247 &#160; 16,692 &#160; Asia 2022 127,399 &#160; 4,597 &#160; 1,144 &#160; 865 &#160; &#160; 2021 117,085 &#160; 4,439 &#160; 988 &#160; 733 &#160; &#160; 2020 4,232 &#160; 1,051 &#160; 788 &#160; Europe, Middle East and Africa 2022 262,856 &#160; 6,044 &#160; 1,121 &#160; 689 &#160; &#160; 2021 233,356 &#160; 5,423 &#160; 1,097 &#160; 3,134 &#160; &#160; 2020 4,491 &#160; ( 596 ) 264 &#160; Latin America and the Caribbean 2022 29,305 &#160; 1,419 &#160; 569 &#160; 367 &#160; &#160; 2021 29,192 &#160; 1,239 &#160; 499 &#160; 330 &#160; &#160; 2020 1,229 &#160; 293 &#160; 150 &#160; Total Non-U.S. 2022 419,560 &#160; 12,060 &#160; 2,834 &#160; 1,921 &#160; &#160; 2021 379,633 &#160; 11,101 &#160; 2,584 &#160; 4,197 &#160; &#160; 2020 9,952 &#160; 748 &#160; 1,202 &#160; Total Consolidated 2022 $ 3,051,375 &#160; $ 94,950 &#160; $ 30,969 &#160; $ 27,528 &#160; &#160; 2021 3,169,495 &#160; 89,113 &#160; 33,976 &#160; 31,978 &#160; &#160; 2020 85,528 &#160; 18,995 &#160; 17,894 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Total assets include long-lived assets, which are primarily located in the U.S. \n\n(2) There were no material intercompany revenues between geographic regions for any of the periods presented. \n\n(3) Substantially reflects the U.S. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n165 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nGlossary \n\nAlt-A Mortgage &#8211; A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or &#8220;prime,&#8221; and less risky than &#8220;subprime,&#8221; the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. \n\nAssets Under Management (AUM) &#8211; The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets&#8217; market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. \n\nBanking Book &#8211; All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes. \n\nBrokerage and Other Assets &#8211; Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping. \n\nCommitted Credit Exposure &#8211; Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. \n\nCredit Derivatives &#8211; Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations. \n\nCredit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) &#8211; A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. \n\nDebit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) &#8211; A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation&#8217;s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities. \n\nFunding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) &#8211; A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. \n\nInterest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) &#8211; Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. \n\nLetter of Credit &#8211; A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer&#8217;s credit for that of the customer. \n\nLoan-to-value (LTV) &#8211; A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. \n\nMacro Products &#8211; Include currencies, interest rates and commodities products. \n\nMargin Receivable &#8211; An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts. \n\nMatched Book &#8211; Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread. \n\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) &#8211; The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. \n\nNonperforming Loans and Leases &#8211; Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. \n\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA) &#8211; A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. \n\nSubprime Loans &#8211; Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers. \n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) &#8211; Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. \n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) &#8211; VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. \n\n##TABLE_START Bank of America 166 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nKey Metrics \n\nActive Digital Banking Users &#8211; Mobile and/or online active users over the past 90 days. \n\nActive Mobile Banking Users &#8211; Mobile active users over the past 90 days. \n\nBook Value &#8211; Ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. \n\nCommon Equity Ratio - Ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending total assets. \n\nDeposit Spread &#8211; Annualized net interest income divided by average deposits. \n\nDividend Payout Ratio &#8211; Common dividends declared divided by net income applicable to common shareholders. \n\nEfficiency Ratio &#8211; Noninterest expense divided by total revenue, net of interest expense. \n\nGross Interest Yield &#8211; Effective annual percentage rate divided by average loans. \n\nNet Interest Yield &#8211; Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. \n\nOperating Margin &#8211; Income before income taxes divided by total revenue, net of interest expense. \n\nReturn on Average Allocated Capital &#8211; Adjusted net income divided by allocated capital. \n\nReturn on Average Assets &#8211; Net income divided by total average assets. \n\nReturn on Average Common Shareholders &#8217; Equity &#8211; Net income applicable to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders&#8217; equity. \n\nReturn on Average Shareholders &#8217; Equity &#8211; Net income divided by average shareholders&#8217; equity. \n\nRisk-adjusted Margi n &#8211; Difference between total revenue, net of interest expense, and net credit losses divided by average loans. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n167 Bank of America \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nAcronyms \n\n##TABLE_START ABS Asset-backed securities AFS Available-for-sale AI Artificial intelligence ALM Asset and liability management ARR Alternative reference rates AUM Assets under management AVM Automated valuation model BANA Bank of America, National Association BHC Bank holding company BofAS BofA Securities, Inc.
