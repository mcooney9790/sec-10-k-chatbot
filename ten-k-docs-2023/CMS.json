Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Executive Overview. \n\nBusiness Segments \n\nConsumers Electric Utility \n\nElectric Utility Operations: Consumers&#8217; electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $5.4 billion in 2022, $5.0 billion in 2021, and $4.4 billion in 2020. Consumers&#8217; electric utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan&#8217;s Lower Peninsula. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following illustration is Consumers&#8217; 2022 electric utility operating revenue of $5.4 billion by customer class: \n\nConsumers&#8217; electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers&#8217; largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers&#8217; financial condition. \n\nIn 2022, Consumers&#8217; electric deliveries were 37 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of three billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34 billion kWh. In 2021, Consumers&#8217; electric deliveries were 36 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of three billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 33 billion kWh. \n\nConsumers&#8217; electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following illustration are Consumers&#8217; monthly weather-normalized electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2022 and 2021: \n\nConsumers&#8217; 2022 summer peak demand was 8,061 MW, which included ROA demand of 532 MW. For the 2021-2022 winter season, Consumers&#8217; peak demand was 5,559 MW, which included ROA demand of 447 MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term PPAs and short-term capacity purchases, all of the capacity required to supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2023. \n\nElectric Utility Properties: Consumers owns and operates electric generation and distribution facilities. For details about Consumers&#8217; electric generation facilities, see the Electric Utility Generation and Supply Mix section that follows this Electric Utility Properties section. Consumers&#8217; distribution system consists of: \n\n&#8226; 212 miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 138 kV \n\n&#8226; four miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 138 kV \n\n&#8226; 4,430 miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 46 kV and 69 kV \n\n&#8226; 19 miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 46 kV \n\n&#8226; 82,326 miles of electric distribution overhead lines \n\n&#8226; 9,501 miles of underground distribution lines \n\n&#8226; 1,093 substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 27 million kVA \n\n&#8226; three battery facilities with storage capacity of 2 MWh \n\nConsumers is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by METC and operated by MISO. Consumers is also interconnected to neighboring utilities and to other transmission systems. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nElectric Utility Generation and Supply Mix: Consumers&#8217; Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers&#8217; long-term energy needs and provides the foundation for its goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. This goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market. \n\nIn June 2022, Consumers received approval of its 2021 IRP, which updated its Clean Energy Plan. With these updates, Consumers expects to meet 90 percent of its customers&#8217; needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its plan, which calls for replacing its coal-fueled generation predominantly with investment in renewable energy. New technologies and carbon offset measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, methane emission capture, forest preservation, and reforestation may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Specifically, the Clean Energy Plan provides for the retirement of the D.E. Karn coal-fueled generating units in 2023 and the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025. For further information on Consumers&#8217; progress towards its net-zero carbon emissions goal, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Executive Overview. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table are details about Consumers&#8217; 2022 electric generation and supply mix: \n\n##TABLE_START Name and Location (Michigan) Number of Units and Year Entered Service 2022 Generation Capacity (MW) 1 \n\n2022 Electric Supply (GWh) Coal steam generation J.H.

During 2022, the pumped-storage facility consumed 1,339 GWh of electricity to pump water during off-peak hours for storage in order to generate 969 GWh of electricity later during peak-demand hours. \n\n2 Represents purchases under long-term PPAs. \n\n3 Represents purchases from the MISO energy market. \n\nDuring 2022, Consumers acquired 47 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market. Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Consumers had future commitments to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants&#8217; availability or deliverability. The payments for 2023 through 2050 are estimated to total $8.5 billion and, for each of the next five years, range from $0.7 billion to $0.8 billion annually. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers&#8217; future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8212;Other Material Cash Requirements and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments&#8212;Contractual Commitments. \n\nDuring 2022, 29 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned six million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 10,217 GWh of electricity. In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Consumers had future commitments to purchase coal through 2024; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $104 million. Most of Consumers&#8217; rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had 85 percent of its 2023 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 34-day supply of coal on hand. \n\nIn conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of railcars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers&#8217; generating facilities. Consumers&#8217; coal transportation contracts are future commitments and expire on various dates through 2025; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $428 million at December 31, 2022. \n\nDuring 2022, 19 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its natural gas&#8209;fueled generating units, which burned 49 bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 6,684 GWh of electricity. \n\nIn order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers&#8217; electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For the Jackson and Zeeland plants, Consumers utilizes an agent that owns firm transportation rights to each plant to purchase gas from the market and transport the gas to the facilities. For units 3 &#38; 4 of D.E. Karn, Consumers holds gas transportation contracts to transport to the plant gas that Consumers or an agent purchase from the market. \n\nElectric Utility Competition: Consumers&#8217; electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services. \n\nMichigan law allows electric customers in Consumers&#8217; service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers&#8217; sales, with certain exceptions. At December 31, 2022, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten&#8209;percent limit. Of Consumers&#8217; 1.9 million electric customers, fewer than 300, or 0.02 percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program. For additional information, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Outlook&#8212;Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties. \n\nConsumers also faces competition or potential competition associated with industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers&#8217; service territory for economic reasons; municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and customer self-generation. Consumers addresses this competition in various ways, including: \n\n&#8226; aggressively controlling operating, maintenance, and fuel costs and passing savings on to customers \n\n&#8226; providing renewable energy options and energy waste reduction programs \n\n&#8226; providing competitive rate-design options, particularly for large energy-intensive customers \n\n&#8226; offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development \n\n&#8226; monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas \n\nTable of Contents \n\nConsumers Gas Utility \n\nGas Utility Operations: Consumers&#8217; gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.7 billion in 2022, $2.1 billion in 2021, and $1.8 billion in 2020. Consumers&#8217; gas utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan&#8217;s Lower Peninsula. \n\nPresented in the following illustration is Consumers&#8217; 2022 gas utility operating revenue of $2.7 billion by customer class: \n\nConsumers&#8217; gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers&#8217; largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers&#8217; financial condition. \n\nIn 2022, deliveries of natural gas through Consumers&#8217; pipeline and distribution network, including off-system transportation deliveries, totaled 391 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 34 bcf. In 2021, deliveries of natural gas through Consumers&#8217; pipeline and distribution network, including off-system transportation deliveries, totaled 347 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 33 bcf. Consumers&#8217; gas utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of natural gas increases in the winter, due primarily to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months. During 2022, 48 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following illustration are Consumers&#8217; monthly weather-normalized natural gas deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2022 and 2021: \n\nGas Utility Properties: Consumers&#8217; gas transmission, storage, and distribution system consists of: \n\n&#8226; 2,380 miles of transmission lines \n\n&#8226; 15 gas storage fields with a total storage capacity of 309 bcf and a working gas volume of 151 bcf \n\n&#8226; 28,170 miles of distribution mains \n\n&#8226; eight compressor stations with a total of 157,893 installed and available horsepower \n\nUnder its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers has set a goal of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery system by 2030. Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. For further information on Consumers&#8217; progress towards its net-zero methane emissions goal, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Executive Overview. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nGas Utility Supply: In 2022, Consumers purchased 86 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. suppliers. The remaining 14 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2022: \n\nFirm gas transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers&#8217; firm gas transportation contracts are with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company and Trunkline Gas Company, LLC, each a non&#8209;affiliated company. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers&#8217; firm gas transportation contracts expire on various dates through 2024 with planned contract volumes providing 38 percent of Consumers&#8217; total forecasted gas supply requirements for 2023. Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program. \n\nGas Utility Competition: Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers&#8217; gas utility business. Competition comes from GCC and transportation programs; system bypass opportunities for new and existing customers; and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNorthStar Clean Energy&#8212;Non-Utility Operations and Investments \n\nNorthStar Clean Energy, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, including the development and operation of renewable generation, and the marketing of independent power production. NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s operating revenue was $445 million in 2022, $308 million in 2021, and $229 million in 2020. \n\nIndependent Power Production: Presented in the following table is information about the independent power plants in which CMS Energy had an ownership interest at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Location Ownership Interest (%) Primary Fuel Type Gross Capacity (MW) 1 \n\n2022 Net Generation (GWh) Dearborn, Michigan 100 Natural gas 770 4,786 Gaylord, Michigan 100 Natural gas 134 14 Paulding County, Ohio 100 Wind 100 317 Comstock, Michigan 100 Natural gas 76 111 Delta Township, Michigan 100 Solar 24 40 Phillips, Wisconsin 100 Solar 3 5 Paulding County, Ohio 100 Solar and storage 3 2 Coke County, Texas \n\n51 Wind 525 1,894 Filer City, Michigan 50 Coal 73 498 New Bern, North Carolina 50 Wood waste 50 291 Flint, Michigan 50 Wood waste 40 163 Grayling, Michigan 50 Wood waste 38 219 Total 1,836 8,340 ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Represents the intended full-load sustained output of each plant.

Consumers&#8217; Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers&#8217; long-term energy needs and provides the foundation for its goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. This goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market. \n\nConsumers expects to meet 90 percent of its customers&#8217; needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its Clean Energy Plan, which calls for replacing its coal-fueled generation predominantly with investment in renewable energy. New technologies and carbon offset measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, methane emission capture, forest preservation, and reforestation may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. \n\nIn June 2022, Consumers received approval of its 2021 IRP, which updated its Clean Energy Plan. With these updates, Consumers will eliminate the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025 and forecasts renewable energy capacity levels of over 60 percent in 2040. For additional information on Consumers&#8217; Clean Energy Plan, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Outlook&#8212;Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties. \n\nIn addition to Consumers&#8217; efforts to reduce the electric utility&#8217;s carbon footprint, it is also making efforts to reduce the gas utility&#8217;s methane footprint. Under its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers has set a goal of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery system by 2030. Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. For additional information on Consumers&#8217; Methane Reduction Plan, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Outlook&#8212;Consumers Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties&#8212;Gas Environmental Outlook. \n\nCMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental regulations for solid waste management, air and water quality, and other matters. Consumers expects to recover costs to comply with environmental regulations in customer rates but cannot guarantee this result. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Outlook, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCMS Energy has recorded a $45 million liability for its subsidiaries&#8217; obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a $62 million liability for its obligations at a number of former MGP sites. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. \n\nCosts related to the construction, operation, corrective action, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Consumers&#8217; coal ash disposal areas are regulated under Michigan&#8217;s solid waste rules and by the EPA&#8217;s rules regulating CCRs. To address some of the requirements of these rules, Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems. In addition, Consumers&#8217; ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly EGLE inspections. Consumers&#8217; estimate of capital and cost of removal expenditures to comply with regulations relating to ash disposal is $205 million from 2023 through 2027. Consumers&#8217; future costs to comply with solid waste disposal regulations may vary depending on future legislation, litigation, executive orders, treaties, or rulemaking. \n\nFor further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to environmental matters, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Outlook&#8212;Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties&#8212;Electric Environmental Outlook. \n\nInsurance \n\nCMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers employ a highly trained and skilled workforce comprised of union, non&#8209;union, and seasonal employees. Presented in the following table are the number of employees of CMS Energy and Consumers: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 2020 CMS Energy, including Consumers Full-time and part-time employees 8,560 8,509 8,234 Seasonal employees 1 \n\n513 613 603 Total employees 9,073 9,122 8,837 Consumers Full-time and part-time employees 8,366 8,314 7,627 Seasonal employees 1 \n\n513 613 603 Total employees 8,879 8,927 8,230 ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Consumers&#8217; seasonal workforce peaked at 587 employees during 2022, 622 employees during 2021, and 603 employees during 2020. Seasonal employees work primarily during the construction season. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAt December 31, 2022, unions represented 41 percent of CMS Energy&#8217;s employees and 42 percent of Consumers&#8217; employees. The UWUA represents Consumers&#8217; operating, maintenance, construction, and customer contact center employees. The USW represents Zeeland plant employees. The UWUA and USW agreements expire in 2025. \n\nThe safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. On an annual basis, CMS Energy and Consumers set various safety goals, with their primary measure being the OSHA recordable incident rate. The recordable incident rate was 1.17 in 2022 and 1.54 in 2021. The target recordable incident rate for 2023 is 1.07. Over the last ten years, Consumers&#8217; OSHA recordable incident rate has decreased by 34 percent. \n\nWithin the utility industry, there is strong competition for rare, high-demand talent, including those related to renewable energy generation, technology, and data analytics. In order to address this competition and to be able to meet their human capital needs, CMS Energy and Consumers provide compensation and benefits that are competitive with industry peers. Furthermore, CMS Energy and Consumers have developed a comprehensive talent strategy, the People Strategy, to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. The strategy focuses on three areas, which are summarized below. \n\n&#8226; Cultivating a Purpose-Driven Culture: This goal is aimed at ensuring all co-workers understand how their work drives CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; key strategic goals. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; progress toward a purpose-driven culture is measured through an engagement index and an empowerment index developed from data obtained through an annual employee engagement survey of union and non-union co-workers administered by a third party. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the employee engagement index score, which measures the percentage of employees that feel satisfied with the company, was 71 percent and ranked in the second quartile of general industry companies. The employee empowerment index score, which measures the percentage of employees that feel the workplace promotes empowerment, was 54 percent and ranked in the third quartile of general industry companies. The general industry benchmark was created by the third party who administered the survey through a targeted sampling of working adults within the U.S. who work for firms with widely respected reputations. CMS Energy and Consumers have a goal to achieve a first-quartile empowerment index score by 2030. \n\n&#8226; Creating a Breakthrough Employee Experience: A breakthrough employee experience is one that instills pride and ownership in one&#8217;s work. To measure progress toward a breakthrough employee experience, CMS Energy and Consumers measure employees&#8217; satisfaction with people processes, such as performance management and hiring and onboarding new employees. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the employee experience index was 54 percent; CMS Energy and Consumers have a goal to achieve a score of 80 percent by 2030. \n\n&#8226; Building Skill Sets at Scale: With an overarching goal of ensuring employees have the right skills to succeed, CMS Energy and Consumers measure progress in this area through achievement of workforce planning and hiring milestones and through a first-time skill attainment index to evaluate the effectiveness of training. CMS Energy and Consumers develop skill sets in co-workers through a variety of means, including union apprenticeship programs and yearly trainings for newly required skills. In 2021, CMS Energy and Consumers launched a full-scale development program for leaders to enable robust succession planning and improve employee engagement and empowerment. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThis talent strategy allows CMS Energy and Consumers to shape employees&#8217; experience and enable leaders to coach and develop co-workers, source talent, and anticipate and adjust to changing skill sets in the business environment. \n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion \n\nAs a part of their People Strategy, CMS Energy and Consumers also employ a comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy designed to embed diversity, equity, and inclusion into all aspects of their business. This is done through embedding standards for diversity, equity, and inclusion into all company processes and ensuring these standards are incorporated into all employee experiences. To measure their success, CMS Energy and Consumers utilize select questions in the annual engagement survey to create a diversity, equity, and inclusion index. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the diversity, equity, and inclusion index score was 72 percent. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are committed to building an inclusive workplace that embraces the diverse makeup of the communities that they serve. The following table presents the composition of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; workforce: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 CMS Energy, including Consumers Consumers Percent female employees 27 % 28 % Percent racially or ethnically diverse employees 12 12 Percent employees with disabilities 5 5 Percent veteran employees 11 11 ##TABLE_END\n\nCo-workers are also empowered to engage in employee resource groups and events that encourage candid conversations around diversity, equity, and inclusion. There are eight employee resource groups available to all co-workers; these groups are, by date of origin: \n\n&#8226; the Women&#8217;s Advisory Panel, contributing to the achievement of the corporate strategy by supporting the retention, development, and success of women \n\n&#8226; the Minority Advisory Panel, promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion among all racial and ethnic minorities through education, leadership, development, and networking \n\n&#8226; the Women&#8217;s Engineering Network, connecting and empowering women in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, while building capabilities to support company objectives \n\n&#8226; the Veteran&#8217;s Advisory Panel, supporting former and active military personnel and assisting in recruiting and retaining veterans through career development \n\n&#8226; GEN-ERGY, a multigenerational group designed to bridge the gap of learning, networking, and mentoring across the generations of the workforce \n\n&#8226; the Pride Alliance of Consumers Energy, promoting an inclusive environment that is safe, supportive, and respectful for lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender persons and allies \n\n&#8226; capABLE, aimed at removing barriers and creating pathways to meaningful work for employees of all abilities \n\n&#8226; Interfaith, a space for co-workers of all backgrounds to gather and celebrate their unique beliefs, creating an environment of understanding and respect for all faiths, religions, and spiritual beliefs, including those with no faith affiliation \n\nTable of Contents \n\nInformation About CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; Executive Officers \n\nPresented in the following table are the company positions held during the last five years for each of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; executive officers as of February 3, 2023: \n\n##TABLE_START Name, Age, Position(s) Period Garrick J.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to a variety of factors, often beyond their control, that are difficult to predict and that involve uncertainties that may materially adversely affect CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy. \n\nInvestment/Financial Risks \n\nCMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations. \n\nDue to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations. \n\nConsumers&#8217; ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers&#8217; preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements. \n\nCMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations. \n\nThe level of CMS Energy&#8217;s present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that: \n\n&#8226; a significant portion of CMS Energy&#8217;s cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes \n\n&#8226; covenants contained in CMS Energy&#8217;s existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business \n\n&#8226; CMS Energy&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited \n\n&#8226; CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged \n\n&#8226; CMS Energy&#8217;s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase \n\n&#8226; CMS Energy&#8217;s future credit ratings could fluctuate \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, which could require CMS Energy to sell assets or obtain additional financing. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs not otherwise funded internally. \n\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, or the inability to obtain required FERC authorization for issuances of securities including debt, could adversely affect CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash including, but not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing commodity purchasing strategies to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash. \n\nEntering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to explore financing opportunities to supplement their respective financial strategies. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, issuing CMS Energy preferred stock and/or common equity, or entering into commercial paper, bank financing, and leasing arrangements. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets&#8217; acceptance of their securities. CMS Energy may also, from time to time, repurchase (either in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire its outstanding debt. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may or may not be material. \n\nCertain of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. A reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase their cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If either or both were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s credit ratings. \n\nMarket performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding. \n\nThe performance of various markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIndustry/Regulatory Risks \n\nChanges to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; businesses. \n\nMichigan law allows electric customers in Consumers&#8217; service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers&#8217; sales, with certain exceptions. The proportion of Consumers&#8217; electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is over ten percent. Consumers&#8217; rates are regulated by the MPSC, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates, putting competitive pressure on Consumers&#8217; electric supply. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nDistributed energy resources could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; businesses. \n\nMichigan law allows customers to use distributed energy resources for their electric energy needs. These distributed energy resources are connected to Consumers&#8217; electric grid. The state distributed generation program is currently capped by the 2016 Energy Law at one percent of utilities&#8217; peak loads, but in the settlement of its 2022 electric rate case, Consumers agreed to increase the cap to four percent on its system. Consumers is required to purchase distributed generation customers&#8217; excess generation at rates determined by the MPSC. Recent FERC policy will also soon allow many customer-owned behind-the-meter and grid-connected distributed energy resources to participate in and receive revenue from wholesale electricity markets. Increased customer use of distributed energy resources could result in a reduction of Consumers&#8217; electric sales. Third parties&#8217; operations of distributed energy resources could also potentially have a negative impact on the stability of the grid. An increase in customers&#8217; use of distributed energy resources, and the rate structure for distributed energy resources customers&#8217; use of Consumers&#8217; system and Consumers&#8217; purchases of their excess generation, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on financial results. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers&#8217; electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. If rate regulators fail to provide adequate rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers&#8217; plans for making significant capital investments. Additionally, increasing rates could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, regulatory or legislative actions, and increased competitive or political pressures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nOrders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non&#8209;paying customers or could prevent or limit the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism. Regulators could face competitive or political pressures to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including economic downturn in the state or decreased customer base, among others. \n\nFERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell wholesale electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates paid by Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries are also set by FERC, as are the tariff terms \n\nTable of Contents \n\ngoverning the participation of Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries in FERC-regulated wholesale electricity markets operated by regional transmission organizations and independent system operators such as MISO and PJM. At least one CMS Energy subsidiary participates in the wholesale electricity markets operated by ERCOT, over which FERC has limited control. \n\nThe various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes to the tariffs or business practice manuals of certain wholesale market operators such as MISO, PJM, or ERCOT could also have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nUtility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; businesses. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. If it were determined that CMS Energy or Consumers failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, they could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies or wholesale electricity market operators, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; operations could also have a material adverse effect. \n\nFERC, through NERC and its delegated regional entities, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric grid. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of FERC orders or actions of NERC and its regional entities on electric system reliability. Additionally, national gas pipeline infrastructure has recently been under scrutiny following disruptions related to extreme weather and cyber incidents. In 2021, the Transportation Security Administration issued two mandatory security directives related to natural gas pipelines that apply to Consumers. Additional regulation in this area could adversely affect Consumers&#8217; gas operations. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers have announced ambitious plans to reduce their impact on climate change and increase the reliability of their electric distribution system. Achieving these plans depends on numerous factors, many of which are outside of their control. \n\nConsumers has announced a long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy, including a plan to end coal use in 2025 as set forth in the 2021 IRP. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, or impair the 2021 IRP and some or all of the 2021 IRP-associated acquisitions of owned or purchased electric generation capacity. Consumers may be unable to acquire, site, and/or permit some or all of the generation capacity proposed in the 2021 IRP. Consumers&#8217; ability to implement the 2021 IRP may be affected by global supply chain disruptions and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of generation capacity. While CMS Energy and Consumers continue to advocate for advances in technologies required to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gases on a cost-effective basis, such advances are largely outside of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; control. Advancements in technology related to items such as battery storage and electric vehicles may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in the 2021 IRP. Customer programs such as energy efficiency and demand response may not realize the projected levels of customer participation. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nConsumers has also announced its Natural Gas Delivery Plan, a 10-year strategic investment plan to deliver safe, reliable, clean, and affordable natural gas to customers. This plan includes accelerated infrastructure replacements, innovative leak detection technology, and process changes to reduce or eliminate methane emissions. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, or impair the Natural Gas Delivery Plan and some or all of the associated capital investments. Consumers&#8217; ability to implement its plan may be affected by environmental regulations, global supply chain disruptions, and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of natural gas or the ability to deliver natural gas to customers. Advancements in technology related to items such as renewable natural gas may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in Consumers&#8217; plan. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if they are unable to achieve their ambitious plans. \n\nChanges in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income taxes, real estate taxes, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect. Additionally, changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts. \n\nCMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain subsidiaries of NorthStar Clean Energy qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that will likely require additional significant capital expenditures for CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. In addition, regulatory action on PFAS at the state and/or federal level could cause CMS Energy and Consumers to further test and remediate some sites if PFAS is present at certain levels. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants, other types of power plants, and natural gas systems that emit greenhouse gases. Federal, state, and local environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, undertake heat-rate improvement projects, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Similarly, \n\nTable of Contents \n\nConsumers could be restricted from constructing natural gas infrastructure due to potential environmental regulations, which could require more costly alternatives. \n\nThe following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy and Consumers: \n\n&#8226; a change in regulators&#8217; implementation of policy or litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy or Consumers due to CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage \n\n&#8226; impairment of CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation \n\n&#8226; extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms or flooding, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or company infrastructure \n\nConsumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, CMS Energy or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures. \n\nFor additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. Business&#8212;CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Compliance and Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Outlook. \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements. \n\nA delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission or pollution control equipment could: \n\n&#8226; prevent the construction of new facilities \n\n&#8226; prevent the continued operation of and sale of energy from existing facilities \n\n&#8226; prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities \n\n&#8226; prevent the modification of existing facilities \n\n&#8226; result in significant additional costs \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites. \n\nConsumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites and other response activity costs at a number of other sites, including, but not limited to, sites of retired coal-fueled electric generating units, under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. \n\nBusiness/Operations Risks \n\nThere are risks associated with Consumers&#8217; substantial capital investment program planned for the next ten years. \n\nConsumers&#8217; planned investments include the construction or acquisition of electric generation, electric and gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, electric grid modernization \n\nTable of Contents \n\ntechnology, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems, as well as decommissioning of older facilities. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers&#8217; control \n\n&#8226; effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects \n\n&#8226; availability of qualified construction personnel, both internal and contracted \n\n&#8226; changes in commodity and other prices, applicable tariffs, and/or material and equipment availability \n\n&#8226; governmental approvals and permitting \n\n&#8226; operational performance \n\n&#8226; changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements \n\n&#8226; regulatory cost recovery \n\n&#8226; inflation of labor rates \n\n&#8226; increases in lead times and disruptions in supply chain distribution \n\n&#8226; barriers to accessing key materials for renewable projects (solar, battery, and other key equipment) created by geopolitical relations and U.S. relations with China \n\nIt is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities. \n\nThe agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to: \n\n&#8226; retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions \n\n&#8226; indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make \n\n&#8226; make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions \n\nMany of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nConsumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories. \n\nConsumers&#8217; electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers&#8217; service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nConsumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results. \n\nTechnology advances, government incentives and subsidies, and recent regulatory decisions could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity and managing energy use resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs. \n\nCustomers could also reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy waste reduction programs. Similarly, customers could also reduce their consumption of natural gas through alternative technologies or fuels. \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year. \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas typically occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Accordingly, CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers&#8217; system could have a material adverse effect. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures. \n\nIn the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive confidential security and customer information. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, are vulnerable to failure, cyber crime, unauthorized access, and being disabled. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, is increasing in frequency, scope, and potential impact. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised. In addition, because CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. \n\nA variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, including backup systems, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; businesses have liability risks. \n\nConsumers&#8217; electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events. \n\nNatural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, civil unrest, vandalism, theft, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could result in severe damage to CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies (which are subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers&#8217; preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result. \n\nEnergy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to changes in market prices for commodities including, but not limited to, natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. CMS Energy and Consumers manage commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and they may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to CMS Energy or Consumers as a result of future volatility. \n\nA substantial portion of Consumers&#8217; operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers&#8217; fuel for electric generation and purchased power are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its positions in these commodities. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. \n\nNatural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts for natural gas to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with the gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its natural gas positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers do not always hedge any or all of the exposure of their operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to execute their risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes in laws that limit CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nConsumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers. \n\nConsumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterparty&#8217;s failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather. \n\nIf Consumers were unable to obtain its supply requirements, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices, implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC, or purchase replacement power at higher prices. \n\nUnplanned outages or maintenance could be costly for CMS Energy or Consumers. \n\nUnforeseen outages or maintenance of the electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities and compression stations, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy or Consumers may be required for many reasons. When unplanned outages occur, CMS Energy and Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but may also have to make spot market purchases of electric and gas commodities that may exceed CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; expected cost of generation or gas supply, be forced to curtail services, or retire a given asset if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Unplanned generator outages could reduce the capacity credit CMS Energy or Consumers receives from MISO and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. \n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect each of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; business, results of operations, financial condition, capital investment program, liquidity, and cash flows. \n\nThe COVID&#8209;19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on people, businesses, economies, and financial markets globally, in the U.S., and in markets where CMS Energy and Consumers conduct business. These impacts include a reduction in economic activity, disruption to supply chains and operations, increased labor costs, reduced availability of labor, and reduced productivity. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk. \n\nAdverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely and adequate fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance, including inadequate performance, of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nVolatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect and could result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight. \n\nA work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, unions represent 42 percent of Consumers&#8217; employees. Consumers&#8217; union agreements expire in 2025. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. \n\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; results of operations. \n\nIn some areas, competition for skilled employees is high and if CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; ability to manage and operate their businesses. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThis Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is a combined report of CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nExecutive Overview \n\nCMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and NorthStar Clean Energy (formerly known as CMS Enterprises Company), primarily a domestic independent power producer and marketer. Consumers&#8217; electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers&#8217; gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers&#8217; customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. NorthStar Clean Energy, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, including the development and operation of renewable generation, and the marketing of independent power production. CMS Energy was also the parent holding company of EnerBank, an industrial bank located in Utah, until October 1, 2021 when EnerBank was acquired by Regions Bank. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and NorthStar \n\nTable of Contents \n\nClean Energy, its non&#8209;utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; businesses are affected primarily by: \n\n&#8226; regulation and regulatory matters \n\n&#8226; state and federal legislation \n\n&#8226; economic conditions \n\n&#8226; weather \n\n&#8226; energy commodity prices \n\n&#8226; interest rates \n\n&#8226; their securities&#8217; credit ratings \n\nThe Triple Bottom Line \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; purpose is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. In support of this purpose, CMS Energy and Consumers employ the &#8220;CE Way,&#8221; a lean operating model designed to improve safety, quality, cost, delivery, and employee morale. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the &#8220;triple bottom line&#8221; of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that CMS Energy and Consumers create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line balances the interests of employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, creditors, Michigan&#8217;s residents, the investment community, and other stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; activities. \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s Environmental, Social, Governance and Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; progress toward world class performance measured in the areas of people, planet, and profit. \n\nPeople: The people element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; commitment to their employees, their customers, the residents of local communities in which they do business, and other stakeholders. \n\nThe safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. Over the last ten years, Consumers&#8217; OSHA recordable incident rate has decreased by 34 percent. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers also place a high priority on customer value and on providing a hometown customer experience. Consumers&#8217; customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability, which has resulted in measurable improvements in customer satisfaction. \n\nCentral to Consumers&#8217; commitment to its customers are the initiatives it has undertaken to keep electricity and natural gas affordable, including: \n\n&#8226; replacement of coal-fueled generation and PPAs with a cost-efficient mix of renewable energy, less-costly dispatchable generation sources, and energy waste reduction and demand response programs \n\n&#8226; targeted infrastructure investment to reduce maintenance costs and improve reliability and safety \n\n&#8226; supply chain optimization \n\n&#8226; economic development to increase sales and reduce overall rates \n\n&#8226; information and control system efficiencies \n\n&#8226; employee and retiree health care cost sharing \n\n&#8226; workforce productivity enhancements \n\nWhile CMS Energy and Consumers have experienced some supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, they have taken steps to mitigate the impact on their ability to provide safe and reliable service to customers. \n\nPlanet: The planet element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; commitment to protect the environment. This commitment extends beyond compliance with various state and federal environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Management considers climate change and other environmental risks in strategy development, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers continue to focus on opportunities to protect the environment and to reduce their carbon footprint. As a result of actions already taken through 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers have: \n\n&#8226; decreased their combined percentage of electric supply (self-generated and purchased) from coal by 17 percentage points since 2015 \n\n&#8226; reduced carbon dioxide emissions by over 30 percent since 2005 \n\n&#8226; reduced the amount of water used to generate electricity by over 35 percent since 2012 \n\n&#8226; reduced landfill waste disposal by over 1.7 million tons since 1992 \n\n&#8226; reduced methane emissions by more than 20 percent since 2012 \n\nTable of Contents \n\nSince 2005, Consumers has reduced its sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions by over 90 percent and its nitrogen oxides emissions by over 80 percent. Consumers began tracking mercury emissions in 2007; since that time, it has reduced such emissions by nearly 90 percent. Presented in the following illustration are Consumers&#8217; reductions in these emissions: \n\nThe 2016 Energy Law: \n\n&#8226; raised the renewable energy standard to 15 percent in 2021; Consumers has met the 15 &#8209; percent requirement and expects to continue meeting the requirement going forward with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years \n\n&#8226; established a goal of 35 &#8209; percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025; Consumers achieved 33 &#8209; percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction through 2022 \n\n&#8226; authorized incentives for demand response programs and energy efficiency programs, referring to the combined initiatives as energy waste reduction programs \n\n&#8226; established an integrated planning process for new capacity and energy resources \n\nConsumers&#8217; Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers&#8217; long-term energy needs. The Clean Energy Plan was originally outlined in Consumers&#8217; 2018 IRP, which was approved by the MPSC in 2019. Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers will meet the requirements of the 2016 Energy Law using its clean and lean strategy, which focuses on increasing the generation of renewable energy, helping customers use less energy, and offering demand response programs to reduce demand during critical peak times. \n\nIn June 2021, Consumers filed its 2021 IRP with the MPSC, proposing updates to the Clean Energy Plan. In April 2022, Consumers and a broad coalition of key stakeholders, including customer groups, environmental organizations, the MPSC Staff, energy industry representatives, and the Michigan Attorney \n\nTable of Contents \n\nGeneral, filed a settlement agreement with the MPSC resolving Consumers&#8217; 2021 IRP. The MPSC approved that settlement agreement in June 2022. \n\nThe 2021 IRP outlines Consumers&#8217; long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy to its customers, including plans to: \n\n&#8226; end the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025, 15 years sooner than initially planned \n\n&#8226; purchase an existing natural gas-fueled generating unit, providing an additional 1,176 MW of nameplate capacity and allowing Consumers to continue providing controllable sources of electricity to customers \n\n&#8226; solicit approximately 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan&#8217;s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025 \n\n&#8226; expand its investment in renewable energy, adding nearly 8,000 MW of solar generation by 2040 \n\nUnder the 2021 IRP, Consumers will continue to earn a return equal to its weighted-average cost of capital on payments made under new competitively bid PPAs approved by the MPSC. \n\nThe 2021 IRP will allow Consumers to exceed its breakthrough goal of at least 50 &#8209; percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2030. \n\nPresented in the following illustration is Consumers&#8217; 2021 capacity portfolio and its future capacity portfolio under its 2021 IRP. This illustration includes the effects of purchased capacity and energy waste reduction and uses the nameplate capacity for all energy sources: \n\n1 Does not include RECs. \n\n2 These amounts and fuel sources will vary and are dependent on a one-time competitive solicitation to acquire approximately 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan&#8217;s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn addition to Consumers&#8217; plan to eliminate its use of coal-fueled generation in 2025, CMS Energy and Consumers have set the net&#8209;zero emissions goals discussed below. \n\nNet-zero methane emissions from natural gas delivery system by 2030: Under its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. \n\nNet-zero carbon emissions from electric business by 2040: This goal includes not only emissions from owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market. Consumers expects to meet 90 percent of its customers&#8217; needs with clean energy sources by 2040 through execution of its Clean Energy Plan. New technologies and carbon offset measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, methane emission capture, forest preservation, and reforestation may be used to close the gap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. \n\nNet-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for the entire business by 2050: This goal, announced in March 2022, incorporates greenhouse gas emissions from Consumers&#8217; natural gas delivery system, including suppliers and customers, and has an interim goal of reducing customer emissions by 20 percent by 2030. Consumers expects to meet this goal through carbon offset measures, renewable natural gas, energy efficiency and demand response programs, and the adoption of cost-effective emerging technologies once proven and commercially available. \n\nAdditionally, to advance its environmental stewardship in Michigan and to minimize the impact of future regulations, Consumers announced the following targets in 2022: \n\n&#8226; to enhance, restore, or protect 6,500 acres of land by 2026; in 2022, Consumers enhanced, restored, or protected over 700 acres of land \n\n&#8226; to increase the rate of waste diverted from landfills (through waste reduction, recycling, and reuse) to 90 percent from a baseline of 88 percent; in 2022, Consumers&#8217; rate of waste diverted from landfills was 92 percent \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring numerous legislative, policy, and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate and report greenhouse gases, and related litigation. While CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could affect them materially, they intend to continue to move forward with their clean and lean strategy. \n\nProfit: The profit element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; commitment to meeting their financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities in which they do business. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; financial strength allows them to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings and thereby reduce funding costs for the benefit of customers and investors, to preserve and create jobs, and to reinvest in the communities they serve. \n\nIn 2022, CMS Energy&#8217;s net income available to common stockholders was $827 million, and diluted EPS were $2.85. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of $1.3 billion and diluted EPS of $4.66 in 2021. In 2022, higher gas sales due primarily to favorable weather, along with benefits from gas and electric rate increases, were more than offset by the absence of the 2021 gain on the sale of EnerBank. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOver the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized electric and gas deliveries to remain relatively stable compared to 2022. This outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset largely by modest growth in electric and gas demand. \n\nPerformance: Impacting the Triple Bottom Line \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers remain committed to achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service and positively impacting the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit. During 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers: \n\n&#8226; settled and received approval of Consumers&#8217; 2021 IRP, gas rate case, and electric rate case, demonstrating the constructive nature of Michigan&#8217;s regulatory environment \n\n&#8226; partnered with state and federal agencies to secure over $100 million of customer assistance to help keep customer bills affordable \n\n&#8226; committed to power over 1,200 Michigan public buildings with 100 &#8209; percent clean energy \n\n&#8226; reached an agreement with General Motors Company, a non-affiliated company, to power all of its auto plants within Consumers&#8217; electric service territory with 100 &#8209; percent clean energy \n\n&#8226; announced the &#8220;Clean Air&#8221; program for residential and business customers who want to offset carbon emissions from their natural gas use and help protect the planet&#8217;s atmosphere \n\n&#8226; installed five new units at the Freedom Compressor Station, continuing progress toward achieving Consumers&#8217; Natural Gas Delivery Plan, making its gas system even more safe, reliable, affordable, and clean \n\n&#8226; participated in the state&#8217;s economic development efforts that resulted in Gotion, Inc., a non &#8209; affiliated global battery components producer, committing to construct a manufacturing facility in Big Rapids, Michigan \n\n&#8226; received recognition as #1 utility company in the U.S. for America&#8217;s Best Employers for Women and America&#8217;s Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes &#174; \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers will continue to utilize the CE Way to enable them to achieve world class performance and positively impact the triple bottom line. Consumers&#8217; investment plan and the regulatory environment in which it operates also drive its ability to impact the triple bottom line. \n\nInvestment Plan: Over the next five years, Consumers expects to make significant expenditures on infrastructure upgrades, replacements, and clean generation. While it has a large number of potential investment opportunities that would add customer value, Consumers has prioritized its spending based on the criteria of enhancing public safety, increasing reliability, maintaining affordability for its customers, and advancing its environmental stewardship. Consumers&#8217; investment program is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of over seven percent. This rate-base growth, together with cost-control measures, should allow Consumers to maintain affordable customer prices. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following illustration are planned capital expenditures of $15.5 billion that Consumers expects to make from 2023 through 2027: \n\nOf this amount, Consumers plans to spend $12.4 billion over the next five years to primarily maintain and upgrade its gas infrastructure and electric distribution systems in order to enhance safety and reliability, improve customer satisfaction, reduce energy waste on those systems, and facilitate its clean energy transformation. The gas infrastructure projects comprise $6.3 billion to sustain deliverability, enhance pipeline integrity and safety, and reduce methane emissions. Electric distribution and other projects comprise $6.1 billion to strengthen circuits and substations, replace poles, and interconnect clean energy resources. Consumers also expects to spend $3.1 billion on clean generation, which includes investments in wind, solar, and hydro electric generation resources. \n\nRegulation: Regulatory matters are a key aspect of Consumers&#8217; business, particularly rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC, which permit recovery of new investments while helping to ensure that customer rates are fair and affordable. Important regulatory events and developments not already discussed are summarized below. \n\n2021 Gas Rate Case: In December 2021, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $278 million, based on a 10.5-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2023. In July 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of $170 million, based on a 9.9-percent authorized return on equity, effective October 1, 2022. The MPSC also approved the continuation of a revenue decoupling mechanism, which annually reconciles Consumers&#8217; actual weather-normalized non-fuel revenues with the revenues approved. \n\n2022 Gas Rate Case: In December 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $212 million, based on a 10.25-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2024. The filing requests authority to recover new infrastructure investment and related costs that are expected to allow Consumers to improve system safety and reliability and reduce fugitive methane emissions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n2022 Electric Rate Case: In April 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a rate increase of $272 million, based on a 10.25-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023. In September 2022, Consumers revised its requested increase to $292 million. The filing requested authority to recover future investments associated with distribution system reliability, solar generation, environmental compliance, and enhanced technology. \n\nIn January 2023, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of $155 million, based on a 9.9-percent authorized return on equity. The MPSC also approved a surcharge for the recovery of $6 million of depreciation, property tax, and interest expense related to distribution investments made in 2021 that exceeded what was authorized in rates in accordance with the December 2020 electric rate order. \n\nLooking Forward \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions. Consumers will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment that will support its customer-driven investment plan, while pursuing cost-control measures that will allow it to maintain sustainable customer base rates. The CE Way is an important means of realizing CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; purpose of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nResults of Operations \n\nCMS Energy Consolidated Results of Operations \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 Change Net Income Available to Common Stockholders $ 827 $ 1,348 $ (521) Basic Earnings Per Average Common Share $ 2.85 $ 4.66 $ (1.81) Diluted Earnings Per Average Common Share $ 2.85 $ 4.66 $ (1.81) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 Change Electric utility $ 567 $ 565 $ 2 Gas utility 378 302 76 NorthStar Clean Energy 34 23 11 Corporate interest and other (156) (144) (12) Discontinued operations 4 602 (598) Net Income Available to Common Stockholders $ 827 $ 1,348 $ (521) ##TABLE_END\n\nFor a summary of net income available to common stockholders for 2021 versus 2020, as well as detailed changes by reportable segment, see Item 7.

CMS Energy uses dividends and tax-sharing payments from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non &#8209; utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMS Energy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMS Energy depends upon each subsidiary&#8217;s revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers&#8217; ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its articles of incorporation and potentially by FERC requirements and provisions under the Federal Power \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAct and the Natural Gas Act. For additional details on Consumers&#8217; dividend restrictions, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 4, Financings and Capitalization&#8212;Dividend Restrictions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Consumers paid $769 million in dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy. \n\nConsumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholder contributions from CMS Energy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. Consumers also uses these sources of funding to contribute to its employee benefit plans. \n\nFinancing and Capital Resources: CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets to fund their robust capital plan. Barring any sustained market dislocations or disruptions, CMS Energy and Consumers expect to continue to have ready access to the financial and capital markets and will continue to explore possibilities to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise with respect to future funding needs. If access to these markets were to diminish or otherwise become restricted, CMS Energy and Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending. \n\nIn January 2023, Consumers entered into a bond purchase agreement to issue an aggregate principal amount of $400 million of first mortgage bonds through a private placement offering. The bonds, which were priced in November 2022, carry a weighted average interest rate of 5.251 percent and mature at varying dates between 2026 and 2037. The bonds are expected to be issued in May 2023. The proceeds of the bonds will be used to finance a portion of the purchase price of the New Covert Generating Facility and for general corporate purposes. For more information on the purchase of the New Covert Generating Facility, see Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties &#8212; Clean Energy Plan. \n\nAlso in January 2023, Consumers issued $425 million of first mortgage bonds that mature in March 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 4.650 percent. The proceeds of the bonds have been used to repay a portion of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under Consumers&#8217; term loan credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. For more information on Consumers&#8217; recent financing activities, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 4, Financings and Capitalization. \n\nUnder an existing equity offering program, CMS Energy may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $500 million in privately negotiated transactions, in &#8220;at the market&#8221; offerings, through forward sales transactions, or otherwise. \n\nCMS Energy has entered into forward sales transactions under this program, which allow CMS Energy to either physically settle the contracts by issuing shares of its common stock at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement or net settle the contracts through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. CMS Energy may settle the contracts at any time through their maturity dates, and presently intends to physically settle the contracts by delivering shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2022, these contracts have an aggregate sales price of $439 million, maturing through February 2024. For more information on these forward sale contracts, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 4, Financings and Capitalization&#8212;Issuance of Common Stock. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, CMS Energy had $532 million of its revolving credit facility available and Consumers had $1.3 billion available under its revolving credit facilities. CMS Energy and Consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. An additional source of liquidity is Consumers&#8217; commercial paper program, which allows Consumers to issue, in one or more placements, up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper notes with \n\nTable of Contents \n\nmaturities of up to 365 days at market interest rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers&#8217; revolving credit facilities. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the available capacity of the revolving credit facilities, Consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available capacity of the facilities. At December 31, 2022, there were $20 million of commercial paper notes outstanding under this program. \n\nCertain of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; credit agreements contain covenants that require CMS Energy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined therein. At December 31, 2022, no default had occurred with respect to any financial covenants contained in CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; credit agreements. CMS Energy and Consumers were each in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2022, as presented in the following table: \n\n##TABLE_START Limit Actual CMS Energy, parent only Debt to Capital 1 \n\n&#60; 0.70 to 1.0 \n\n0.58 to 1.0 Consumers Debt to Capital 2 \n\n&#60; 0.65 to 1.0 \n\n0.50 to 1.0 ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Applies to CMS Energy&#8217;s revolving credit agreement and letter of credit reimbursement agreement, and a term loan agreement of a subsidiary of NorthStar Clean Energy. \n\n2 Applies to Consumers&#8217; revolving credit agreements and term loan agreement. \n\nMaterial Cash Requirements: Based on the present investment plan, during 2023, Consumers projects capital expenditures of $3.7 billion. Additionally, CMS Energy&#8217;s other material cash requirements for 2023 include $3.2 billion of purchase obligations and $1.7 billion of principal and interest payments on long-term debt. Consumers&#8217; other material cash requirements for 2023 comprise $3.0 billion of purchase obligations and $1.4 billion of principal and interest payments on long-term debt. \n\nComponents of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; cash management plan include controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for financing and refinancing opportunities. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; present level of cash and expected cash flows from operating activities, together with access to sources of liquidity, are anticipated to be sufficient to fund contractual obligations and other material cash requirements for 2023 and beyond. \n\nCapital Expenditures: Over the next five years, Consumers expects to make substantial capital investments. Consumers may revise its forecast of capital expenditures periodically due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations, MPSC approval or disapproval, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. Presented in the following table are Consumers&#8217; estimated capital expenditures, including lease commitments, for 2023 through 2027: \n\n##TABLE_START In Billions 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Total Consumers Electric utility operations $ 2.5 $ 1.6 $ 1.9 $ 1.6 $ 1.6 $ 9.2 Gas utility operations 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.2 6.3 Total Consumers $ 3.7 $ 2.9 $ 3.2 $ 2.9 $ 2.8 $ 15.5 ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nOther Material Cash Requirements : Presented in the following table are CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; material cash obligations from known contractual and other legal obligations: \n\n##TABLE_START In Billions Payments Due December 31, 2022 \n\nLess Than One Year Total CMS Energy, including Consumers \n\nLong-term debt $ 1.1 $ 14.4 Interest payments on long-term debt 0.6 13.2 Purchase obligations 3.2 12.5 AROs &#8212; 2.7 Total obligations $ 4.9 $ 42.8 Consumers \n\nLong-term debt $ 1.0 $ 10.3 Interest payments on long-term debt 0.4 7.8 Purchase obligations 3.0 11.9 AROs &#8212; 2.6 Total obligations $ 4.4 $ 32.6 ##TABLE_END\n\nPurchase obligations arise from long-term contracts for the purchase of commodities and related services, plant purchase commitments, and construction and service agreements. The commodities and related services include long-term PPAs, natural gas and associated transportation, and coal and associated transportation. For more information on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; purchase obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments&#8212;Contractual Commitments. \n\nCMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries enter into various arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, and financial and performance guarantees. For additional details on indemnity and guarantee arrangements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments&#8212;Guarantees.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 4, Financings and Capitalization. \n\nOutlook \n\nSeveral business trends and uncertainties may affect CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; financial condition and results of operations. These trends and uncertainties could have a material impact on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position. For additional details regarding these and other uncertainties, see Forward-Looking Statements and Information; Item 1A. Risk Factors; and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. \n\nConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties \n\nClean Energy Plan: Consumers&#8217; Clean Energy Plan details its strategy to meet customers&#8217; long-term energy needs and provides the foundation for its goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. Under this net-zero goal, Consumers plans to eliminate the impact of carbon \n\nTable of Contents \n\nemissions created by the electricity it generates or purchases for customers. Additionally, through its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers continues to make progress on expanding its customer programs, namely its demand response, energy efficiency, and conservation voltage reduction programs, as well as increasing its renewable energy and pumped storage generation. \n\nThe Clean Energy Plan was originally outlined in Consumers&#8217; 2018 IRP, which was approved by the MPSC in 2019. In June 2021, Consumers filed its 2021 IRP with the MPSC, proposing updates to the Clean Energy Plan. In April 2022, Consumers and a broad coalition of key stakeholders, including customer groups, environmental organizations, the MPSC Staff, energy industry representatives, and the Michigan Attorney General, filed a settlement agreement with the MPSC resolving Consumers&#8217; 2021 IRP. The MPSC approved that settlement agreement in June 2022. \n\nUnder its 2021 IRP, Consumers will eliminate the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025 and expects to meet 90 percent of its customers&#8217; needs with clean energy sources by 2040. Specifically, the 2021 IRP provides for: \n\n&#8226; the retirement of the D.E. Karn coal-fueled generating units, totaling 515 MW of nameplate capacity, in 2023 \n\n&#8226; the retirement of the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units, totaling 1,407 MW of nameplate capacity, in 2025 \n\n&#8226; the retirement of the D.E. Karn oil and gas-fueled generating units, totaling 1,219 MW of nameplate capacity, in 2031, the units&#8217; original retirement date \n\nThe MPSC has authorized Consumers to issue securitization bonds to finance the recovery of and return on the D.E. Karn coal-fueled generating units. Under the 2021 IRP, Consumers will receive regulatory asset treatment to recover the remaining book value of the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units, as well as a 9.0&#8209;percent return on equity, commencing in 2025. \n\nUnder the 2021 IRP, Consumers will bridge the transition away from coal generation with: \n\n&#8226; the purchase of the New Covert Generating Facility, a natural gas-fueled generating unit with 1,176 MW of nameplate capacity in Van Buren County, Michigan, for $815 million, subject to certain adjustments, in 2023; the purchase was approved by FERC in November 2022 \n\n&#8226; a one-time competitive solicitation to acquire approximately 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan&#8217;s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025; of this amount, 500 MW would be from dispatchable sources \n\nThese actions are expected to allow Consumers to continue providing controllable sources of electricity to customers while expanding its investment in renewable energy. The 2021 IRP forecasts renewable energy capacity levels of 30 percent in 2025, 43 percent in 2030, and 61 percent in 2040, including the addition of nearly 8,000 MW of solar generation. Additionally, the 2021 IRP will accelerate Consumers&#8217; deployment of battery storage from 2030 to 2024, with 75 MW of energy storage by 2027 and an additional 475 MW by 2040. \n\nUnder its 2021 IRP, Consumers will continue to bid new capacity competitively and will own and operate approximately 50 percent of new capacity, with the remainder being built and owned by third parties. Additionally, Consumers will continue to earn a return equal to its weighted-average cost of capital on payments made under new competitively bid PPAs approved by the MPSC. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAs a result of requests for proposals, Consumers has entered into PPAs to purchase renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from solar generating facilities and build transfer agreements to purchase solar generating facilities. Presented in the following illustration is the aggregate renewable capacity that Consumers expects to add to its portfolio as a result of these agreements: \n\nIn support of its 2021 IRP, Consumers issued a request for proposals in September 2022 to acquire approximately 700 MW of capacity through PPAs from sources able to deliver to Michigan&#8217;s Lower Peninsula beginning in 2025. Specifically, Consumers solicited offers to acquire 500 MW of capacity from dispatchable sources and 200 MW of capacity from intermittent resources and dispatchable, non-intermittent clean capacity resources (including battery storage resources). \n\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it is opening inquiries into whether manufacturers of solar modules that are produced in certain countries using supplies obtained from China are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duties which apply to Chinese modules. The U.S. Department of Commerce has made an initial determination that four manufacturers have circumvented tariffs. The remainder of this inquiry process is expected to continue through at least the first half of 2023. In June 2022, the Biden Administration paused for two years the imposition of duties that might result from the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s pending inquiries. In addition, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which was enacted in December 2021 and became effective in June 2022, along with an earlier withhold release order that U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued in mid-2021, restrict the importation of goods sourced from the Xinjiang region of China. Solar modules whose raw materials come from the Xinjiang region are a key focus of these import laws. Consumers continues to closely monitor these matters and their potential impacts on availability of solar modules and timing associated with pending and planned solar projects. \n\nRenewable Energy Plan: The 2016 Energy Law raised the renewable energy standard to 15 percent in 2021. Consumers is required to submit RECs, which represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource, in an amount equal to at least 15 percent of Consumers&#8217; electric sales volume each year. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers has met the 15 &#8209; percent \n\nTable of Contents \n\nrequirement and expects to continue meeting the requirement going forward with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years. \n\nUnder Consumers&#8217; renewable energy plan, the MPSC has approved the acquisition of up to 525 MW of new wind generation projects and authorized Consumers to earn a 10.7 &#8209; percent return on equity on any projects approved by the MPSC. Specifically, the MPSC has approved the following: \n\n&#8226; purchase and construction of a 150 &#8209; MW wind generation project in Gratiot County, Michigan; the project became operational and Consumers took full ownership in 2020 \n\n&#8226; purchase of a 166 &#8209; MW wind generation project in Hillsdale, Michigan; the project became operational and Consumers took full ownership in February 2021 \n\n&#8226; purchase of a wind generation project under development, with capacity of up to 201 MW, in Gratiot County, Michigan; Consumers expects to take full ownership and begin commercial operation of the project in 2023 \n\nThe MPSC also approved the execution of a 20-year PPA under which Consumers will purchase 100 MW of renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from a 149 &#8209; MW solar generating facility to be constructed in Calhoun County, Michigan; the facility is targeted to be operational in 2024. \n\nVoluntary Large Customer Renewable Energy Program: Consumers provides service under a program that provides large full-service electric customers with the opportunity to advance the development of renewable energy beyond the requirements of the 2016 Energy Law. In September 2021, the MPSC approved Consumers&#8217; request to amend its renewable energy plan to remove the annual subscription limit associated with this program. The MPSC also approved up to 1,000 MW of new wind and solar generation projects between 2024 and 2027 to meet customer demand for the program. Consumers will competitively solicit for additional renewable energy assets based on customer applications and will construct the assets based on customer subscriptions to the program. \n\nElectric Customer Deliveries and Revenue: Consumers&#8217; electric customer deliveries are seasonal and largely dependent on Michigan&#8217;s economy. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment. In addition, Consumers&#8217; electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Each year in June, electric residential customers transition to a summer peak time-of-use rate that allows them to take advantage of lower-cost energy during off-peak times during the summer months. Thus, customers can reduce their electric bills by shifting their consumption from on&#8209;peak to off&#8209;peak times. \n\nOver the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized electric deliveries to remain relatively stable compared to 2022. This outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset largely by modest growth in electric demand. Actual delivery levels will depend on: \n\n&#8226; energy conservation measures and results of energy waste reduction programs \n\n&#8226; weather fluctuations \n\n&#8226; Michigan&#8217;s economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population trends, electric vehicle adoption, and housing activity \n\nElectric ROA: Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers&#8217; service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers&#8217; sales, with certain exceptions. At December 31, 2022, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten&#8209;percent limit. Of Consumers&#8217; 1.9 million electric customers, fewer than 300, or 0.02 percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe 2016 Energy Law established a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. The law also authorized the MPSC to ensure that alternative electric suppliers have procured enough capacity to cover their anticipated capacity requirements for the four-year forward period. In 2017, the MPSC issued an order establishing a state reliability mechanism for Consumers. Under this mechanism, if an alternative electric supplier does not demonstrate that it has procured its capacity requirements for the four-year forward period, its customers will pay a set charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier. \n\nDuring 2017, the MPSC issued orders finding that it has statutory authority to determine and implement a local clearing requirement, which requires all electric suppliers to demonstrate that a portion of the capacity procured to serve customers during peak demand times is located in the MISO footprint in Michigan&#8217;s Lower Peninsula. In 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed the MPSC&#8217;s statutory authority to implement a local clearing requirement on individual electric providers. \n\nIn 2020, ABATE and another intervenor filed a complaint against the MPSC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan challenging the constitutionality of a local clearing requirement. The complaint requests the federal court to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the MPSC from implementing a local clearing requirement on individual electric providers. Consumers filed a motion to intervene and defend the local clearing requirement in that federal litigation; this motion was granted in January 2021 and the complaint is pending decision by the court after a non-jury trial. \n\nElectric Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers&#8217; electric utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. \n\nMPSC Reliability Report and Audit: In October 2022, the MPSC ordered the state&#8217;s two largest electric utilities, including Consumers, to report on their compliance with regulations and past MPSC orders governing the utilities&#8217; response to outages and downed lines. Also, the MPSC Staff was directed to engage a third-party auditor to review all equipment and operations of the two utilities&#8217; distribution systems. \n\nConsumers has responded to the MPSC&#8217;s order and awaits further action by the MPSC. Consumers is committed to working with other state utilities, the third-party auditor, and the MPSC to continue improving electric reliability and safety in Michigan. \n\n2022 Electric Rate Case: In April 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a rate increase of $272 million, based on a 10.25-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023. In September 2022, Consumers revised its requested increase to $292 million. The filing requested authority to recover future investments associated with distribution system reliability, solar generation, environmental compliance, and enhanced technology. \n\nIn January 2023, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of $155 million, based on a 9.9-percent authorized return on equity. The MPSC also approved a surcharge for the recovery of $6 million of depreciation, property tax, and interest expense related to distribution investments made in 2021 that exceeded what was authorized in rates in accordance with the December 2020 electric rate order. Additionally, the approved settlement provides for a pension and OPEB tracker that will allow Consumers to defer the future recovery or refund of pension and OPEB expenses above or below the amounts used to set existing rates, respectively. For additional details on the \n\nTable of Contents \n\nsettlement agreement, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 2, Regulatory Matters. \n\nPSCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2023 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September 2022. As a result of higher-than-normal power supply costs during 2022, Consumers included a projection of its full-year 2022 underrecovery in its 2023 PSCR plan. In accordance with its proposed plan, Consumers self-implemented the 2023 PSCR charge beginning in January 2023. \n\nIn January 2023, Consumers filed a motion for a temporary order in its 2023 PSCR plan, requesting that the MPSC approve only a third of the 2022 underrecovery amount for recovery in 2023, with the remaining amount to be recovered equally during 2024 and 2025. Recovering the 2022 underrecovery over three years will provide immediate relief to electric customers, and the financial impact will be neutral to Consumers&#8217; earnings. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 2, Regulatory Matters. \n\nRetention Incentive Program: Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers will retire the D.E. Karn coal-fueled electric generating units in 2023. In 2019, Consumers announced a retention incentive program to ensure necessary staffing at the D.E. Karn generating complex through the anticipated retirement of the coal-fueled generating units. Based on the number of employees that have chosen to participate, the aggregate cost of the program through 2023 is estimated to be $35 million. In its order in Consumers&#8217; 2020 electric rate case, the MPSC approved deferred accounting treatment for these costs. Consumers expects to recognize $2 million of retention benefit costs in 2023; this expense will be deferred as a regulatory asset. \n\nUnder the 2021 IRP, Consumers will retire the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025. Similar to the D.E. Karn program, Consumers is providing a retention incentive program to ensure necessary staffing at the J.H. Campbell generating complex through retirement. Based on the number of employees that have chosen to participate, the aggregate cost of the program through 2025 is estimated to be $50 million. Consumers expects to recognize $16 million of retention benefit costs in 2023. The 2021 IRP provides deferred accounting treatment for retention costs recognized during 2022; deferral of costs beyond 2022 was approved as part of the 2022 electric rate case settlement. For additional details on these programs, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 19, Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations. \n\nElectric Environmental Outlook: Consumers&#8217; electric operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of $210 million from 2023 through 2027 to continue to comply with RCRA, the Clean Air Act, and numerous other environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. Consumers&#8217; primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters. \n\nAir Quality: Multiple air quality regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers&#8217; electric utility. \n\nIn 2012, the EPA published emission standards for electric generating units, known as MATS, based on Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. Consumers has complied, and continues to comply, with the MATS regulation, and does not expect MATS to materially impact its environmental strategy. \n\nCSAPR requires Michigan and many other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to EPA modeling, contribute to ground-level ozone in other downwind states. Since its 2015 effective date, CSAPR has been revised several times. One such revision made in 2021 \n\nTable of Contents \n\nprovided updated emission reductions through 2024 from electric generating units in 12 states, including Michigan. Consumers believes the impact of this rule on its generation operations should be minimal. \n\nIn March 2022, the EPA proposed another revision to CSAPR that affects Michigan. If finalized as proposed, this revision would reduce nitrogen oxides allowance budgets beginning in 2023 and would change the mechanism for allocating such allowances on a year-over-year basis. While prior CSAPR regulations have primarily focused on electric generating units, this latest proposal also includes other sources of nitrogen oxides emissions. If the EPA finalizes the proposed CSAPR revision in its current form, Consumers may incur significant costs in allowance purchases and/or equipment retrofits. Consumers will continue to monitor this rulemaking and its impact on Consumers&#8217; electric operations. \n\nIn 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify power plants and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. In 2018, the EPA designated certain areas of Michigan as not meeting the ozone standard. None of Consumers&#8217; fossil-fuel-fired generating units are located in these areas. Additionally, in January 2023, the EPA proposed lowering the NAAQS for particulate matter. Consumers will continue to monitor NAAQS rulemakings and evaluate potential impacts to its generating assets. \n\nConsumers&#8217; strategy to comply with air quality statutes and regulations involved the installation and operation of emission control equipment at some facilities and the suspension of operations at others; however, Consumers continues to evaluate these rules in conjunction with other EPA and EGLE rulemakings, litigation, executive orders, treaties, and congressional actions. This evaluation could result in: \n\n&#8226; a change in Consumers&#8217; fuel mix \n\n&#8226; changes in the types of generating units Consumers may purchase or build in the future \n\n&#8226; changes in how certain units are operated \n\n&#8226; the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some of Consumers&#8217; generating units \n\n&#8226; changes in Consumers&#8217; environmental compliance costs \n\n&#8226; the purchase or sale of allowances \n\nGreenhouse Gases: There have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, national, and international levels that involve the potential regulation and reporting of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives, as appropriate. \n\nIn June 2022, the EPA announced its plan to propose a new rule to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. Under its 2021 IRP, Consumers will eliminate the use of coal-fueled generation in 2025. Therefore, it is unlikely that the proposed rule will materially impact Consumers over the remaining operating lives of these coal-fueled facilities. However, Consumers cannot predict the form and extent of such potential regulation on its natural gas-fueled generation until this rule is released. \n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, an international agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Under its 2021 IRP, Consumers plans to reduce carbon emissions from its electric business by 60 percent from 2005 levels in 2025. At this time, Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of these events, as its plans exceed the nationally committed reduction. The commitment made by the U.S. is not binding without new Congressional legislation. \n\nIn 2020, Michigan&#8217;s Governor signed an executive order creating the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, which outlines goals for Michigan to achieve economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncarbon neutral by 2050. The executive order aims for a 28 &#8209; percent reduction below 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. These goals are aspirational in nature and any changes in law or regulation to achieve these goals would need to be approved by the Michigan Legislature or the relevant regulatory agency. Additionally, Consumers has already surpassed the 28 &#8209; percent reduction milestone for its owned electric generation and previously announced a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of these events. \n\nIncreased frequency or intensity of severe or extreme weather events, including those due to climate change, could materially impact Consumers&#8217; facilities, energy sales, and results of operations. Consumers is unable to predict these events or their financial impact; however, Consumers evaluates the potential physical impacts of climate change on its operations, including increased frequency or intensity of storm activity; increased precipitation; increased temperature; and changes in lake and river levels. Consumers released a report addressing the physical risks of climate change on its infrastructure in February 2022. Consumers is taking steps to mitigate these risks as appropriate. \n\nWhile Consumers cannot predict the outcome of changes in U.S. policy or of other legislative, executive, or regulatory initiatives involving the potential regulation or reporting of greenhouse gases, it intends to move forward with its Clean Energy Plan, its present net-zero goals, and its emphasis on reliable and resilient supply. Litigation, international treaties, executive orders, federal laws and regulations (including regulations by the EPA), and state laws and regulations, if enacted or ratified, could ultimately impact Consumers. Consumers may be required to: \n\n&#8226; replace equipment \n\n&#8226; install additional emission control equipment \n\n&#8226; purchase emission allowances or credits (including potential greenhouse gas offset credits) \n\n&#8226; curtail operations \n\n&#8226; arrange for alternative sources of supply \n\n&#8226; purchase facilities that generate fewer emissions \n\n&#8226; mothball or retire facilities that generate certain emissions \n\n&#8226; pursue energy efficiency or demand response measures more swiftly \n\n&#8226; take other steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases \n\nAlthough associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover these costs in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations. \n\nCCRs: In 2015, the EPA published a rule regulating CCRs under RCRA. This rule adopts minimum standards for beneficially using and disposing of non&#8209;hazardous CCRs and establishes technical requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments. The rule also sets out conditions under which some CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR wastewater and initiate closure. Due to litigation, many aspects of the rule have been remanded to the EPA, resulting in more proposed and final rules. Anticipated litigation related to remanded aspects will add uncertainty around requirements for compliance and state permit programs. \n\nIn 2020, the EPA amended the conditions of forced closure and required all unlined surface impoundments to initiate closure by mid-2021, unless conditions that satisfied an alternate closure schedule were approved by the EPA. Consumers, with agreement from EGLE, completed the work necessary to initiate closure by excavating CCRs or placing a final cover over each of its relevant CCR units prior to the closure initiation deadline. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nSeparately, Congress passed legislation in 2016 allowing participating states to develop permitting programs for CCRs under RCRA Subtitle D. In 2018, the Michigan Legislature adopted standards for a permitting program, which requires the EPA&#8217;s authorization. In 2020, EGLE submitted a regulatory package for Michigan&#8217;s permit program to the EPA for its review, which is still pending. Federal rulemaking challenges may delay EPA approval of the Michigan permitting program. \n\nConsumers has historically been authorized to recover in electric rates costs related to coal ash disposal sites. \n\nWater: Multiple water-related regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers. \n\nThe EPA regulates cooling water intake systems of existing electric generating plants under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. The rules seek to reduce alleged harmful impacts on aquatic organisms, such as fish. In 2018, Consumers submitted to EGLE for approval all required studies and recommended plans to comply with Section 316(b), but has not yet received final approval. \n\nThe EPA also regulates the discharge of wastewater through its effluent limitation guidelines for steam electric generating plants. In 2020, the EPA revised previous guidelines related to the discharge of certain wastewater, but allowed for extension of the compliance deadline from the end of 2023 to the end of 2025, upon approval by EGLE through the NPDES permitting process. Consumers received such an extension to 2025 for its J.H. Campbell generating facility, which it plans to retire in 2025. Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of these revisions or any litigation of the guidelines. \n\nIn recent years, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have proposed changes to the scope of federal jurisdiction over bodies of water and to the frequency of dual jurisdiction in states with authority to regulate the same waters; Michigan is one such state. Additionally, a final 2022 rulemaking changed the definition of &#8220;Waters of the United States.&#8221; Consumers does not expect adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of the current interpretations. \n\nMany of Consumers&#8217; facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are vital to the facilities&#8217; operations. Consumers applies for renewal of these permits every five years. Failure of EGLE to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, a change in the interpretation or scope of NPDES permitting, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility. \n\nProtected Wildlife: Multiple regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers relating to protected species and habitats. \n\nStatutes like the federal Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act may impact operations at Consumers&#8217; facilities. In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced its intent to regulate incidental take under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Any resulting permitting and monitoring fees and/or restrictions on operations could impact Consumers&#8217; existing and future operations, including wind and solar generation facilities. \n\nAdditionally, Consumers is monitoring proposed changes to the listing status of several species within its operational area due to an increase in wildlife-related regulatory activity at federal and state levels. A change in species listed under the Endangered Species Act may impact Consumers&#8217; costs to mitigate its impact on protected species and habitats at certain existing facilities as well as siting choices for new facilities. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOther Matters: Other electric environmental matters could have a material impact on Consumers&#8217; outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments&#8212;Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies&#8212;Electric Environmental Matters. \n\nConsumers Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties \n\nGas Deliveries: Consumers&#8217; gas customer deliveries are seasonal. The peak demand for natural gas typically occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. \n\nOver the next five years, Consumers expects weather-normalized gas deliveries to remain stable relative to 2022. This outlook reflects the effects of energy waste reduction programs offset largely by modest growth in gas demand. Actual delivery levels will depend on: \n\n&#8226; weather fluctuations \n\n&#8226; use by power producers \n\n&#8226; availability and development of renewable energy sources \n\n&#8226; gas price changes \n\n&#8226; Michigan&#8217;s economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity \n\n&#8226; the price or demand of competing energy sources or fuels \n\n&#8226; energy efficiency and conservation impacts \n\nGas Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers&#8217; gas utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. \n\n2022 Gas Rate Case: In December 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $212 million, based on a 10.25-percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2024. The filing requests authority to recover new infrastructure investment and related costs that are expected to allow Consumers to improve system safety and reliability and reduce fugitive methane emissions. Presented in the following table are the components of the requested increase in revenue: \n\n##TABLE_START Projected Twelve-Month Period Ending September 30 2024 Components of the requested rate increase Investment in rate base $ 80 Operating and maintenance costs 47 Cost of capital 63 Sales and other revenue 22 Total $ 212 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe filing also seeks approval of a pension and OPEB tracker that will allow Consumers to defer for future recovery or refund pension and OPEB expense above the amounts used to set existing rates and an uncollectible deferral/refund mechanism. \n\nPostretirement Benefits Expense Accounting Application: In January 2023, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC, requesting authority to defer the future recovery or refund of pension and OPEB expenses above or below the amounts used to set existing rates, respectively. Consumers requested this accounting treatment to begin in 2023 and to continue until rates are reset in the 2022 gas rate case. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDepreciation Rate Case: In December 2021, Consumers filed a depreciation case related to its gas utility plant property. In this case, Consumers requested a decrease in depreciation expense of $1 million annually based on December 31, 2020 balances. In September 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing a decrease in depreciation expense of $29 million annually. The decrease in depreciation expense will become effective concurrent with Consumers&#8217; 2022 gas rate case. \n\nGCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2023-2024 GCR plan to the MPSC in December 2022 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, expects to self-implement the 2023-2024 GCR charge beginning in April 2023. \n\nGas Pipeline and Storage Integrity and Safety: The U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has published various rules that expand federal safety standards for gas transmission pipelines and underground storage facilities. Initial requirements took effect in 2020, with future regulation phases to be released over numerous years. To comply with these rules, Consumers will incur increased capital and operating and maintenance costs to install and remediate pipelines and to expand inspections, maintenance, and monitoring of its existing pipelines and storage facilities. \n\nAlthough associated capital or operating and maintenance costs relating to these regulations could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover such costs in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with laws and regulations. \n\nGas Environmental Outlook: Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23 former MGP sites. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments&#8212;Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies&#8212;Gas Environmental Matters. \n\nConsumers&#8217; gas operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. Consumers&#8217; primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters. \n\nAir Quality: Multiple air quality regulations apply, or may apply, to Consumers&#8217; gas utility. \n\nIn 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify natural gas compressor stations and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. In 2018, the EPA designated certain areas of Michigan as not meeting the ozone standard. Seven counties in southeastern Michigan were not in attainment with the ozone standard by a 2021 regulatory deadline, and thus may have their ozone nonattainment designations increased from marginal to moderate. The EPA also recently elevated the nonattainment status of three counties in western Michigan from marginal to moderate. Some of Consumers&#8217; compressor stations are located in these areas. Consumers expects to incur costs to retrofit equipment to lower emissions at some of its compressor stations located in the nonattainment areas. \n\nIn March 2022, the EPA proposed a revision to CSAPR that affects Michigan. This proposed rule seeks to reduce interstate air pollution transport issues that EPA modeling suggests contribute to downwind states attaining or maintaining compliance with the NAAQS for ozone. While prior CSAPR regulations have primarily focused on electric generating units, the proposed rule includes other emission sources, including engines at natural gas compressor stations. If the EPA finalizes the proposed CSAPR revision in its current form, Consumers may incur costs to retrofit or replace equipment at some compressor stations. \n\nGreenhouse Gases: There is increasing interest at the federal, state, and local levels in potential regulation of greenhouse gases or their sources. Such regulation, if adopted, may involve requirements to reduce \n\nTable of Contents \n\nmethane emissions from Consumers&#8217; gas utility operations and carbon dioxide emissions from customer use of natural gas. No such measures apply to Consumers at this time. \n\nIn 2020, Michigan&#8217;s Governor signed an executive order creating the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, which outlines goals for Michigan to achieve economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and to be carbon neutral by 2050. The executive order aims for a 28 &#8209; percent reduction below 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. For additional details on the executive order, see Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties&#8212;Electric Environmental Outlook. \n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, an international agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. The commitment made by the U.S. is not binding without new Congressional legislation. Consumers continues to monitor these initiatives and comment as appropriate. Consumers cannot predict the impact of any potential future legislation or regulation on its gas utility. \n\nConsumers is making voluntary efforts to reduce its gas utility&#8217;s methane emissions. Under its Methane Reduction Plan, Consumers has set a goal of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery system by 2030. Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will likely be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas. To date, Consumers has reduced methane emissions by more than 20 percent from a 2012 baseline. \n\nIn March 2022, Consumers also announced a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for its entire natural gas system by 2050. This includes suppliers and customers, and has an interim goal of reducing customer emissions by 20 percent by 2030. Consumers&#8217; Natural Gas Delivery Plan, a 10-year strategic investment plan to deliver safe, reliable, clean, and affordable natural gas to customers, outlines ways in which Consumers can make early progress toward these goals in a cost-effective manner, including energy waste reduction or energy efficiency, carbon offsets, and renewable natural gas supply. \n\nConsumers has already initiated work in these key areas, continuing to expand its energy waste reduction targets, launching a program allowing gas customers to purchase carbon offset credits on a voluntary basis, and announcing plans to begin development of a renewable natural gas facility that will capture methane from manure generated at a Michigan-based farm and convert it into renewable natural gas. Consumers is evaluating and monitoring newer technologies to determine their role in achieving Consumers&#8217; interim and long-term net-zero goals, including hydrogen, biofuels, and synthetic methane; carbon capture sequestration systems; and other innovative technologies. \n\nOver the long term, Consumers will incorporate technological advances, policy-driven incentives, and other influencing factors into its compliance, investment planning, and decarbonization strategy in order to achieve these net-zero methane and greenhouse gas emissions goals. \n\nNorthStar Clean Energy Outlook and Uncertainties \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s primary focus with respect to its NorthStar Clean Energy businesses is to maximize the value of generating assets, its share of which represents 1,478 MW of capacity, and to pursue opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects. \n\nNorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s operations may be subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Multiple environmental laws and regulations are subject to litigation. NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone and made it more difficult to construct or modify power plants and other emission sources in areas of the country that do not meet the ozone standard. In 2018, the EPA designated certain areas of Michigan as not meeting the ozone standard. Seven counties in southeastern Michigan were not in attainment with the ozone standard by a 2021 regulatory deadline, and thus may have their ozone nonattainment designations increased from marginal to moderate. The DIG plant is within one of these counties and, as a result, may be subject to additional permitting restrictions in the event of any future increase in the nonattainment designation. \n\nIn March 2022, the EPA proposed a revision to CSAPR that affects Michigan. This proposed rule seeks to reduce interstate air pollution transport issues that EPA modeling suggests contribute to downwind states attaining or maintaining compliance with the NAAQS for ozone. If the EPA finalizes the proposed CSAPR revision in its current form, NorthStar Clean Energy may incur significant costs in allowance purchases and equipment retrofits. NorthStar Clean Energy will continue to monitor this rulemaking and its impact on its emission sources. \n\nMany of NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are vital to the facilities&#8217; operations. NorthStar Clean Energy applies for renewal of these permits every five years. Failure of EGLE to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, a change in the interpretation or scope of NPDES permitting, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility. \n\nFor additional details regarding the new ozone NAAQS or CSAPR rule, see Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties&#8212;Electric Environmental Outlook. \n\nTrends, uncertainties, and other matters related to NorthStar Clean Energy that could have a material impact on CMS Energy&#8217;s consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include: \n\n&#8226; investment in and financial benefits received from renewable energy and energy storage projects \n\n&#8226; changes in energy and capacity prices \n\n&#8226; severe weather events and climate change associated with increasing levels of greenhouse gases \n\n&#8226; changes in commodity prices on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings \n\n&#8226; changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation \n\n&#8226; indemnity obligations assumed in connection with ownership interests in facilities that involve tax equity financing \n\n&#8226; representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMS Energy in connection with sales of assets \n\n&#8226; delays or difficulties in obtaining environmental permits for facilities located in areas associated with environmental justice concerns \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it is opening inquiries into whether manufacturers of solar modules that are produced in certain countries using supplies obtained from China are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duties which apply to Chinese modules. The U.S. Department of Commerce has made an initial determination that four manufacturers have circumvented tariffs. The remainder of this inquiry process is expected to continue through at least the first half of 2023. In June 2022, the Biden Administration paused for two years the imposition of duties that might result from the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s pending inquiries. In addition, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which was enacted in December 2021 and became effective in June 2022, along with an earlier withhold release order that U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued in mid-2021, restrict the importation of goods sourced from the Xinjiang region of China. Solar modules whose raw materials come from the Xinjiang region are a key focus of these import laws. CMS Energy continues to closely monitor these matters and their potential impacts on availability of solar modules and timing associated with pending and planned solar projects. \n\nFor additional details regarding NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s uncertainties, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments&#8212;Guarantees. \n\nOther Outlook and Uncertainties \n\nLitigation: CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. For additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 2, Regulatory Matters and Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. \n\nEmployee Separation Program: In April 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers announced a voluntary separation program for salaried non-union employees. For the year ended December 31, 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers recorded an after-tax charge of $8 million related to the program, under which more than 170 employees accepted and were approved for early separation. As a result of the program, CMS Energy and Consumers expect to benefit from future cost savings, as employee staffing levels will be better matched to workload demand, which reflects the companies&#8217; ongoing workforce productivity improvements. \n\nTax Legislation: CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. Among other things, this Act expands production tax credits and investment tax credits, allows for the transferability of such credits, and implements a 15 &#8209; percent corporate alternative minimum tax on companies with an average adjusted financial statement income of more than $1.0 billion. While CMS Energy and Consumers are still assessing the overall impacts of the bill, they have determined they will not be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in 2023, and do not believe the corporate alternative minimum tax will have a material impact on their business. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe following information is important to understand CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; results of operations and financial condition. For additional accounting policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies. \n\nIn the preparation of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMS Energy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, the effects of regulation, indemnities, contingencies, and AROs. Actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. CMS Energy and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments. \n\nAccounting for the Effects of Industry Regulation: Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators&#8217; decisions on its financial statements. Consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings. \n\nContingencies: CMS Energy and Consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. For such matters, they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. In particular, CMS Energy and Consumers are participating in various environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. The recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. For remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMS Energy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments. \n\nDerivative Instruments: CMS Energy and Consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. If a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. At CMS Energy, if the derivative is accounted for as a cash flow hedge, unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in AOCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions impact earnings. If the derivative is accounted for as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For the FTRs at Consumers, changes in fair value are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. \n\nThe criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for derivative accounting or for an exception from derivative accounting are complex and often require judgment in application. Changes in business strategies or market conditions, as well as a requirement to apply different interpretations of the derivative accounting literature, could result in changes in accounting for a single contract or groups of contracts, \n\nTable of Contents \n\nwhich could have a material impact on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; financial statements. For additional details on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are determined, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 5, Fair Value Measurements. \n\nIncome Taxes: The amount of income taxes paid by CMS Energy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMS Energy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMS Energy&#8217;s judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. CMS Energy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMS Energy&#8217;s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time. For additional details, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12, Income Taxes. \n\nPension and OPEB: CMS Energy and Consumers provide retirement pension benefits to certain employees under non&#8209;contributory DB Pension Plans, and they provide postretirement health and life benefits to qualifying retired employees under an OPEB Plan. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including: \n\n&#8226; life expectancies \n\n&#8226; discount rates \n\n&#8226; expected long-term rate of return on plan assets \n\n&#8226; rate of compensation increases \n\n&#8226; expected health care costs \n\nA change in these assumptions could change significantly CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; recorded liabilities and associated expenses. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table are estimates of credits and cash contributions through 2025 for the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Pl an. Actual future costs, credits, and contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the participants of the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan. CMS Energy and Consumers will, at a minimum, contribute to the plans as needed to comply with federal funding requirements. ##TABLE_START In Millions DB Pension Plans OPEB Plan Credit Contribution Credit Contribution CMS Energy, including Consumers 2023 $ (58) $ &#8212; $ (76) $ &#8212; 2024 (64) &#8212; (71) &#8212; 2025 (63) &#8212; (75) &#8212; Consumers 1 \n\n2023 $ (54) $ &#8212; $ (70) $ &#8212; 2024 (59) &#8212; (65) &#8212; 2025 (59) &#8212; (69) &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Consumers&#8217; pension and OPEB costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process. \n\nLowering the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of the DB Pension Plans by 25 basis points would increase estimated pension cost for 2023 by $8 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers. Lowering the PBO discount rates by 25 basis points would decrease estimated pension cost for 2023 by $1 million for both CMS Energy and Consumers. \n\nPension and OPEB plan assets are accounted for and disclosed at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of these assumptions may require judgment. \n\nFor additional details on postretirement benefits, including the fair value measurements for the assets of the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 10, Retirement Benefits. \n\nUnbilled Revenues: Consumers&#8217; customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or natural gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. Consumers records unbilled revenues as accounts receivable and accrued revenue on its consolidated balance sheet. For additional information on unbilled revenues, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 14, Revenue. \n\nNew Accounting Standards \n\nThere are no new accounting standards issued but not yet effective that are expected to have a material impact on CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; consolidated financial statements. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and investment security prices. They may enter into various risk management contracts to mitigate exposure to these risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. CMS Energy and Consumers enter into these contracts using established policies and procedures, under the direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of certain officers and a risk committee consisting of those and other officers and business managers. \n\nThe following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial instruments, assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of ten percent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were to exceed ten percent. \n\nLong-Term Debt: CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate debt instruments. CMS Energy and Consumers use a combination of these instruments, and may also enter into interest-rate swap agreements, in order to manage this risk and to achieve a reasonable cost of capital. \n\nPresented in the following table is a sensitivity analysis of interest-rate risk on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; debt instruments (assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of ten percent): \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions December 31 2022 2021 Fixed-rate financing&#8212;potential loss in fair value CMS Energy, including Consumers $ 711 $ 639 Consumers 482 402 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair value losses in the above table could be realized only if CMS Energy and Consumers transferred all of their fixed-rate financing to other creditors. The annual earnings exposure related to variable-rate financing was immaterial for both CMS Energy and Consumers at December 31, 2022 and 2021, assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of ten percent.

CMS Energy&#8217;s consolidated financial statements comprise CMS Energy, Consumers, NorthStar Clean Energy, and all other entities in which CMS Energy has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Consumers&#8217; consolidated financial statements comprise Consumers and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. CMS Energy uses the equity method of accounting for investments in companies and partnerships that are not consolidated, where they have significant influence over operations and financial policies but are not the primary beneficiary. CMS Energy and Consumers eliminate intercompany transactions and balances. \n\nUse of Estimates: CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are held primarily for the repayment of securitization bonds and funds held in escrow. Cash and cash equivalents may also be restricted to pay other contractual obligations such as leasing of coal railcars. These amounts are classified as current assets since they relate to payments that could or will occur within one year. \n\nContingencies: CMS Energy and Consumers record estimated loss contingencies on their consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. For environmental remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMS Energy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. CMS Energy and Consumers expense legal fees as incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on estimates of work performed. \n\nDebt Issuance Costs, Discounts, Premiums, and Refinancing Costs: Upon the issuance of long-term debt, CMS Energy and Consumers defer issuance costs, discounts, and premiums and amortize those amounts over the terms of the associated debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Upon the refinancing of long-term debt, Consumers, as a regulated entity, defers any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with the refinanced debt and amortizes those amounts over the term of the newly issued debt. For the non&#8209;regulated portions of CMS Energy&#8217;s business, any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with extinguished debt are charged to earnings. \n\nDerivative Instruments: In order to support ongoing operations, CMS Energy and Consumers enter into contracts for the future purchase and sale of various commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, and coal. These forward contracts are generally long-term in nature and result in physical delivery of the \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncommodity at a contracted price. Most of these contracts are not subject to derivative accounting for one or more of the following reasons: \n\n&#8226; they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity or bcf of natural gas) \n\n&#8226; they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception \n\n&#8226; they cannot be net settled due in part to the absence of an active market for the commodity \n\nConsumers also uses FTRs to manage price risk related to electricity transmission congestion. An FTR is a financial instrument that entitles its holder to receive compensation or requires its holder to remit payment for congestion-related transmission charges. Consumers accounts for FTRs as derivatives. \n\nAdditionally, CMS Energy uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk on certain long-term debt transactions. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers record derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value on their consolidated balance sheets. At CMS Energy, if the derivative is accounted for as a cash flow hedge, unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in AOCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions impact earnings. If the derivative is accounted for as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For the FTRs at Consumers, changes in fair value are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. For details regarding CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; derivative instruments recorded at fair value, see Note 5, Fair Value Measurements. \n\nEPS: CMS Energy calculates basic and diluted EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted EPS, includes the effects of nonvested stock awards and forward equity sales. CMS Energy computes the effect on potential common stock using the treasury stock method. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of antidilutive securities, which are those securities resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease in loss per share. For EPS computations, see Note 13, Earnings Per Share&#8212;CMS Energy. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments: CMS Energy and Consumers perform tests of impairment if certain triggering events occur that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or that there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers evaluate long-lived assets held in use for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, CMS Energy and Consumers recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. CMS Energy and Consumers estimate the fair value of the asset using quoted market prices, market prices of similar assets, or discounted future cash flow analyses. \n\nCMS Energy also assesses equity method investments for impairment whenever there has been a decline in value that is other than temporary. This assessment requires CMS Energy to determine the fair value of the equity method investment. CMS Energy determines fair value using valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, and assesses the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment. CMS Energy records an impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nInvestment Tax Credits: Consumers amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment. CMS Energy&#8217;s non&#8209;regulated businesses use the deferral method of accounting for investment tax credits. Under the deferral method, the book basis of the associated assets is reduced by the amount of the credit, resulting in lower depreciation expense over the life of the assets. Furthermore, the tax basis of the assets is reduced by 50 percent of the related credit, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. CMS Energy recognizes the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. \n\nInventory: CMS Energy and Consumers use the weighted-average cost method for valuing working gas, recoverable base gas in underground storage facilities, and materials and supplies inventory. CMS Energy and Consumers also use this method for valuing coal inventory, and they classify these amounts as generating plant fuel stock on their consolidated balance sheets. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers account for RECs and emission allowances as inventory and use the weighted-average cost method to remove amounts from inventory. RECs and emission allowances are used to satisfy compliance obligations related to the generation of power. CMS Energy and Consumers classify these amounts within other assets on their consolidated balance sheets. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers evaluate inventory for impairment as required to ensure that its carrying value does not exceed the lower of cost or net realizable value. \n\nMISO Transactions: MISO requires the submission of hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. CMS Energy and Consumers account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and day-ahead markets, netted across all MISO energy market locations. CMS Energy and Consumers record net hourly purchases in purchased and interchange power and net hourly sales in operating revenue on their consolidated statements of income. They record net billing adjustments upon receipt of settlement statements, record accruals for future net purchases and sales adjustments based on historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses and sales upon receipt of settlement statements. \n\nProperty Taxes: Property taxes are based on the taxable value of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; real and personal property assessed by local taxing authorities. CMS Energy and Consumers record property tax expense over the fiscal year of the taxing authority for which the taxes are levied. The deferred property tax balance represents the amount of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; accrued property tax that will be recognized over future governmental fiscal periods. \n\nReclassifications: CMS Energy and Consumers have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the presentation in the present period. The most significant of these reclassifications is related to CMS Energy&#8217;s sale of EnerBank to Regions Bank in October 2021. EnerBank&#8217;s results of operations through the date of the sale are presented as income from discontinued operations on CMS Energy&#8217;s consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For information regarding the sale of EnerBank, see Note 19, Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers also reclassified certain prior period amounts relating to postretirement benefits. The asset balances for postretirement benefits are presented discretely within other non-current assets on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nRenewable Energy Grant: In 2013, Consumers received a renewable energy cash grant for Lake Winds &#174; Energy Park under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009. Upon receipt of the grant, Consumers recorded a regulatory liability, which Consumers is amortizing over the life of Lake Winds &#174; Energy Park. Consumers presents the amortization as a reduction to maintenance \n\nTable of Contents \n\nand other operating expenses on its consolidated statements of income. Consumers recorded the deferred income taxes related to the grant as a reduction of the book basis of Lake Winds &#174; Energy Park. \n\nOther: For additional accounting policies, see: \n\n&#8226; Note 7, Plant, Property, and Equipment \n\n&#8226; Note 8, Leases \n\n&#8226; Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations \n\n&#8226; Note 10, Retirement Benefits \n\n&#8226; Note 12, Income Taxes \n\n&#8226; Note 13, Earnings Per Share&#8212;CMS Energy \n\n&#8226; Note 14, Revenue \n\n&#8226; Note 18, Variable Interest Entities \n\n2: Regulatory Matters \n\nRegulatory matters are critical to Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, residential customer advocacy groups, environmental organizations, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers, such as Consumers&#8217; rate cases and PSCR and GCR processes. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers&#8217; policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders. Depending upon the specific issues, the outcomes of rate cases and proceedings, including judicial proceedings challenging MPSC orders or other actions, could negatively affect CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. \n\nThere are multiple appeals pending that involve various issues concerning cost recovery from customers, the MPSC&#8217;s authority to approve voluntary revenue refunds, and other matters. Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of these appeals. \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities \n\nConsumers is subject to the actions of the MPSC and FERC and therefore prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of regulatory accounting. A utility must apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under regulatory accounting, Consumers records regulatory assets or liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as expense or revenue by non&#8209;regulated businesses. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table are the regulatory assets and liabilities on Consumers&#8217; consolidated balance sheets: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions December 31 End of Recovery or Refund Period 2022 2021 Regulatory assets Current Energy waste reduction plan incentive 1 \n\n2023 $ 47 &#160; $ 42 &#160; Other 2023 10 &#160; 4 &#160; Total current regulatory assets $ 57 &#160; $ 46 &#160; Non-current Costs of coal-fueled electric generating units to be retired 2 \n\nvarious $ 1,960 &#160; $ 678 &#160; Postretirement benefits 3 \n\nvarious 856 &#160; 837 &#160; ARO 4 \n\nvarious 281 &#160; 247 &#160; Securitized costs 2 \n\n2029 165 &#160; 193 &#160; MGP sites 4 \n\nvarious 108 &#160; 112 &#160; Unamortized loss on reacquired debt 4 \n\nvarious 100 &#160; 104 &#160; Energy waste reduction plan incentive 1 \n\n2024 55 &#160; 46 &#160; Retention incentive program 4 \n\nvarious 31 &#160; 7 &#160; Demand response program 4 \n\nvarious 12 &#160; 10 &#160; Energy waste reduction plan 4 \n\nvarious 10 &#160; 13 &#160; Other various 17 &#160; 12 &#160; Total non-current regulatory assets $ 3,595 &#160; $ 2,259 &#160; Total regulatory assets $ 3,652 &#160; $ 2,305 &#160; Regulatory liabilities Current Income taxes, net 2023 $ 48 &#160; $ 138 &#160; Reserve for customer refunds 2023 47 &#160; 2 &#160; Other 2023 9 &#160; 6 &#160; Total current regulatory liabilities $ 104 &#160; $ 146 &#160; Non-current Cost of removal various $ 2,426 &#160; $ 2,375 &#160; Income taxes, net various 1,267 &#160; 1,297 &#160; Renewable energy grant 2043 45 &#160; 47 &#160; Renewable energy plan 2028 32 &#160; 13 &#160; Demand response program various 12 &#160; 7 &#160; Energy waste reduction plan various 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Postretirement benefits various &#8212; &#160; 54 &#160; Other various 8 &#160; 9 &#160; Total non-current regulatory liabilities $ 3,796 &#160; $ 3,802 &#160; Total regulatory liabilities $ 3,900 &#160; $ 3,948 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 These regulatory assets have arisen from an alternative revenue program and are not associated with incurred costs or capital investments. Therefore, the MPSC has provided for recovery without a return. \n\n2 The MPSC has provided a specific return on these regulatory assets. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n3 This regulatory asset is included in rate base, thereby providing a return. \n\n4 These regulatory assets represent incurred costs for which the MPSC has provided recovery without a return on investment . \n\nRegulatory Assets \n\nEnergy Waste Reduction Plan Incentive: The energy waste reduction incentive mechanism provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers&#8217; customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC. \n\nIn October 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to collect $ 46 million during 2023 as an incentive for exceeding its statutory savings targets in 2021. Consumers recognized incentive revenue under this program of $ 46 million in 2021. \n\nConsumers also exceeded its statutory savings targets in 2022, achieved certain other goals, and will request the MPSC&#8217;s approval to collect $ 55 million, the maximum performance incentive, in the energy waste reduction reconciliation to be filed in May 2023. Consumers recognized incentive revenue under this program of $ 55 million in 2022. \n\nCosts of Coal-fueled Electric Generating Units to be Retired: In 2019, the MPSC approved the settlement agreement reached in Consumers&#8217; 2018 IRP, under which Consumers will retire the D.E. Karn coal-fueled electric generating units in 2023. Under Michigan law, electric utilities have been permitted to use highly rated, low-cost securitization bonds to finance the recovery of qualified costs. In 2019, Consumers removed from total plant, property, and equipment an amount representing the projected remaining book value of the two coal-fueled electric generating units upon their retirement, and recorded it as a regulatory asset. In 2020, the MPSC issued a securitization financing order authorizing Consumers to issue securitization bonds in order to finance the recovery of the remaining book value of the two coal-fueled electric generating units upon their retirement. Until securitization, the book value of the generating units will remain in rate base and receive full regulatory returns in general rate cases. \n\nIn June 2022, the MPSC approved the settlement agreement reached in Consumers&#8217; 2021 IRP, under which Consumers plans to retire the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025. Under the 2021 IRP, upon the units&#8217; retirement, Consumers will receive regulatory asset treatment to recover their remaining book value, as well as a 9.0 &#8209;percent return on equity, over their original design lives. Until retirement, the book value of the generating units will remain in rate base and receive full regulatory returns in general rate cases. \n\nIn June 2022, Consumers removed from total plant, property, and equipment an amount of $ 1.3 billion, representing the projected remaining book value of the electric generating units upon their retirement, and recorded it as a non-current regulatory asset on its consolidated balance sheets. \n\nPostretirement Benefits: As part of the ratemaking process, the MPSC allows Consumers to recover the costs of postretirement benefits. Accordingly, Consumers defers the net impact of actuarial losses and gains, prior service costs and credits, and settlements associated with postretirement benefits as a regulatory asset or liability. The asset or liability will decrease as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. For details about settlements and the amortization periods, see Note 10, Retirement Benefits. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nARO: The recovery of the underlying asset investments and related removal and monitoring costs of recorded AROs is approved by the MPSC in depreciation rate cases. Consumers records a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability for timing differences between the recognition of AROs for financial reporting purposes and the recovery of these costs from customers. The recovery period approximates the useful life of the assets to be removed. \n\nSecuritized Costs: In 2013, the MPSC issued a securitization financing order authorizing Consumers to issue securitization bonds in order to finance the recovery of the remaining book value of seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in 2016 and three smaller natural gas-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in 2015. Upon receipt of the MPSC&#8217;s order, Consumers removed the book value of the ten units from plant, property, and equipment and recorded this amount as a regulatory asset. Consumers is amortizing the regulatory asset over the life of the related securitization bonds, which it issued through a subsidiary in 2014. For additional details regarding the securitization bonds, see Note 4, Financings and Capitalization. \n\nMGP Sites: Consumers is incurring environmental remediation and other response activity costs at 23 former MGP facilities. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover from its natural gas customers over a ten-year period the costs incurred to remediate the MGP sites. \n\nUnamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt: Under regulatory accounting, any unamortized discount, premium, or expense related to debt redeemed with the proceeds of new debt is capitalized and amortized over the life of the new debt. \n\nRetention Incentive Program: To ensure necessary staffing at the D.E. Karn and J.H. Campbell generating complexes through the anticipated retirement of the coal-fueled generating units, Consumers has established retention incentive programs. In 2020, the MPSC approved deferred accounting treatment for the retention and severance costs incurred under the D.E. Karn program, and Consumers began deferring these costs as a regulatory asset in 2021. In addition, under the 2021 IRP, the MPSC approved deferred accounting treatment for the retention and severance costs incurred under the J.H. Campbell program during 2022; deferral of costs beyond 2022 was approved as part of the 2022 electric rate case settlement. For additional details regarding the retention incentive program, see Note 19, Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations. \n\nDemand Response Program: In Consumers&#8217; 2018 IRP and general rate cases, the MPSC has approved the recovery of demand response costs. Consumers annually files a reconciliation with the MPSC to review actual demand response costs against amounts approved. The amount of spending incurred in excess of amounts included in rates for recovery is recorded as a regulatory asset and amortized when it is collected from customers. The amount included in rates for recovery in excess of spending incurred is recorded as a regulatory liability to be refunded to customers. \n\nEnergy Waste Reduction Plan: The MPSC allows Consumers to collect surcharges from customers to fund its energy waste reduction plan. The amount of spending incurred in excess of surcharges collected is recorded as a regulatory asset and amortized as surcharges are collected from customers over the plan period. The amount of surcharges collected in excess of spending incurred is recorded as a regulatory liability and amortized as costs are incurred. \n\nRegulatory Liabilities \n\nIncome Taxes, Net: Consumers records regulatory assets and liabilities to reflect the difference between deferred income taxes recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts previously reflected in Consumers&#8217; rates. This net balance will decrease over the remaining life of the related temporary differences and flow through income tax expense. The majority of the net regulatory liability recorded \n\nTable of Contents \n\nrelated to income taxes is associated with plant assets that are subject to normalization, which is governed by the Internal Revenue Code, and will be returned to customers over the remaining book life of the related plant assets. For additional details on deferred income taxes, see Note 12, Income Taxes. \n\nReserve for Customer Refunds: In December 2022, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to refund $ 22 million voluntarily to utility customers. In January 2023, Consumers submitted a filing proposing that the refund take the form of incremental funding to cover the cost of, and return on, certain distribution capital investments above amounts included in rates and contributions to programs that assist vulnerable customers. \n\nAdditionally, in the settlement of its 2022 electric rate case, Consumers agreed to refund voluntarily $ 15 million of 2022 revenues to utility customers through a one-time bill credit and to fund $ 10 million in contributions to programs that directly assist vulnerable customers with utility bills. \n\nCost of Removal: The MPSC allows Consumers to collect amounts from customers to fund future asset removal activities. This regulatory liability is reduced as costs are incurred to remove the assets at the end of their useful lives. \n\nRenewable Energy Grant: In 2013, Consumers received a $ 69 million renewable energy grant for Lake Winds &#174; Energy Park, which began operations in 2012. This grant reduces Consumers&#8217; cost of complying with Michigan&#8217;s renewable portfolio standard and, accordingly, reduces the overall renewable energy surcharge to be collected from customers. The regulatory liability recorded for the grant will be amortized over the life of Lake Winds &#174; Energy Park. \n\nRenewable Energy Plan: Consumers has collected surcharges to fund its renewable energy plan. Amounts not yet spent under the plan are recorded as a regulatory liability, which is amortized as incremental costs are incurred to operate and depreciate Consumers&#8217; renewable generation facilities and to purchase RECs under renewable energy purchase agreements. Incremental costs represent costs incurred in excess of amounts recovered through the PSCR process. \n\nConsumers Electric Utility \n\n2021 Electric Rate Case: In December 2021, the MPSC issued a final order in Consumers&#8217; 2021 electric rate case, disallowing cost recovery for fleet assets and certain other categories of recently completed capital expenditures incurred by Consumers. As a result, Consumers impaired certain of these capital expenditures, a portion of which were held by the gas utility, and recorded impairment charges totaling $ 45 million within maintenance and other operating expenses on its consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\n2022 Electric Rate Case: In April 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking a rate increase of $ 272 million, based on a 10.25 -percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2023. In September 2022, Consumers revised its requested increase to $ 292 million. The filing requested authority to recover future investments associated with distribution system reliability, solar generation, environmental compliance, and enhanced technology. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn January 2023, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of $ 155 million, based on a 9.9 -percent authorized return on equity. The MPSC also approved a surcharge for the recovery of $ 6 million of depreciation, property tax, and interest expense related to distribution investments made in 2021 that exceeded what was authorized in rates in accordance with the December 2020 electric rate order. Additionally, the approved settlement provides for the following: \n\n&#8226; a pension and OPEB tracker that will allow Consumers to defer the future recovery or refund of pension and OPEB expenses above or below the amounts used to set existing rates, respectively \n\n&#8226; a refund of $ 15 million of 2022 revenues to utility customers through a one-time bill credit \n\n&#8226; a commitment to fund $ 10 million in contributions to programs that directly assist vulnerable customers with utility bills \n\n&#8226; deferred accounting treatment for depreciation and property tax expense as well as the debt component of the overall rate of return for distribution-related capital investments exceeding a certain threshold amount \n\n&#8226; an increase to the distributed generation cap from two percent to four percent on Consumers&#8217; system \n\nThere were no direct disallowances of historical capital expenditures within the approved settlement agreement. The new rates became effective January 20, 2023. \n\nVoluntary Radio Tower Asset Sale Gain Share: In May 2022, Consumers completed a sale of various radio tower assets. In June 2022, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC requesting approval to share voluntarily half of the gain from the sale with its electric and gas utility customers; this application was approved by the MPSC in October 2022. During 2022, Consumers shared two-thirds with electric customers through additional spending for tree trimming and one-third with gas customers through a donation to nonprofit agencies that provide customer energy bill assistance. \n\nConsumers Gas Utility \n\n2021 Gas Rate Case: In December 2021, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $ 278 million, based on a 10.5 -percent authorized return on equity for the projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2023. In April 2022, Consumers reduced its requested annual rate increase to $ 233 million, based on a 10.25 -percent authorized return on equity. In July 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an annual rate increase of $ 170 million, based on a 9.9 -percent authorized return on equity, effective October 1, 2022. The MPSC also approved the continuation of a revenue decoupling mechanism, which annually reconciles Consumers&#8217; actual weather-normalized non-fuel revenues with the revenues approved. \n\nPower Supply Cost Recovery and Gas Cost Recovery \n\nThe PSCR and GCR ratemaking processes are designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply and purchased natural gas costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts its PSCR and GCR billing charges monthly, subject to ceiling factor limitations, in order to minimize the underrecovery or overrecovery amount in the annual reconciliations. Underrecoveries represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers; overrecoveries represent previously collected revenues that will be refunded to customers. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table are the assets and liabilities for PSCR and GCR underrecoveries and overrecoveries reflected on Consumers&#8217; consolidated balance sheets: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions December 31 2022 2021 Assets PSCR underrecoveries $ 401 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; GCR underrecoveries 8 &#160; 25 &#160; Accounts receivable and accrued revenue $ 409 &#160; $ 25 &#160; Liabilities PSCR overrecoveries $ &#8212; &#160; $ 12 &#160; Accrued rate refunds $ &#8212; &#160; $ 12 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDue to spikes in fuel prices during 2022, the cost of electric generation increased, resulting in higher market prices for electricity. Accordingly, Consumers&#8217; power supply costs for 2022 were significantly higher than those projected in its 2022 PSCR plan. Consumers included a projection of its full-year 2022 underrecovery in the 2023 PSCR plan filed with the MPSC in September 2022. In January 2023, Consumers filed a motion for a temporary order in its 2023 PSCR plan, requesting that the MPSC approve only a third of the 2022 underrecovery amount for recovery in 2023, with the remaining amount to be recovered equally during 2024 and 2025. Recovering the 2022 underrecovery over three years will provide immediate relief to electric customers, and the financial impact will be neutral to Consumers&#8217; earnings. \n\nPSCR Plans and Reconciliations: In August 2022, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers&#8217; 2020 PSCR reconciliation, authorizing recovery of $ 1.8 billion of power costs and authorizing Consumers to reflect in its 2021 PSCR reconciliation the underrecovery of $ 1 million. In its order, the MPSC disallowed the recovery of $ 1 million of replacement power costs associated with an extended outage at Ludington. Consumers filed an appeal of the MPSC&#8217;s order with the Michigan Court of Appeals in September 2022. \n\nIn March 2022, Consumers filed its 2021 PSCR reconciliation, requesting full recovery of $ 2.1 billion of power costs and authorization to reflect in its 2022 PSCR reconciliation the overrecovery of $ 8 million. \n\nConsumers submitted its 2022 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September 2021 and self-implemented its proposed 2022 PSCR charge in January 2022. \n\nGCR Plans and Reconciliations: In April 2022, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement in Consumers&#8217; 2020-2021 GCR reconciliation, authorizing recovery of $ 0.4 billion of gas costs and authorizing Consumers to reflect in its 2021-2022 GCR reconciliation the overrecovery of $ 2 million. \n\nIn June 2022, Consumers filed its 2021-2022 GCR reconciliation, requesting full recovery of $ 0.7 billion of gas costs and authorization to reflect in its 2022-2023 GCR reconciliation the underrecovery of $ 9 million. \n\nConsumers submitted its 2022-2023 GCR plan to the MPSC in December 2021 and self-implemented its proposed 2022-2023 GCR charge in April 2022. In June 2022, Consumers filed with the MPSC a revised GCR plan requesting an increase to the GCR factor due to rising natural gas prices. Consumers self-implemented that increased factor in October 2022. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n3: Contingencies and Commitments \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers are involved in various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. Depending on the specific issues, the resolution of these contingencies could negatively affect CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In their disclosures of these matters, CMS Energy and Consumers provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss when such an estimate can be made. Disclosures stating that CMS Energy or Consumers cannot predict the outcome of a matter indicate that they are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss for the matter. \n\nCMS Energy Contingencies \n\nBay Harbor: CMS Land retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection and treatment of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. In 2012, CMS Land and EGLE finalized an agreement establishing the final remedies and the future water quality criteria at the site. CMS Land completed all construction necessary to implement the remedies required by the agreement and will continue to maintain and operate a system to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay under an NPDES permit, which was renewed in January 2022 and is valid through 2025. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, CMS Energy had a recorded liability of $ 45 million for its remaining obligations for environmental remediation. CMS Energy calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount rate of 4.34 percent and an inflation rate of one percent on annual operating and maintenance costs. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $ 57 million. CMS Energy expects to pay the following amounts for long-term leachate disposal and operating and maintenance costs in each of the next five years: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 CMS Energy Long-term leachate disposal and operating and maintenance costs $ 4 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ 4 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s estimate of response activity costs and the timing of expenditures could change if there are changes in circumstances or assumptions used in calculating the liability. Although a liability for its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has been recorded, CMS Energy cannot predict the ultimate financial impact or outcome of this matter. \n\nConsumers Electric Utility Contingencies \n\nElectric Environmental Matters: Consumers&#8217; operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Historically, Consumers has generally been able to recover, in customer rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations. \n\nCleanup and Solid Waste: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under NREPA. Consumers believes that these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers estimates its liability for NREPA sites for which it can estimate a range of loss to be between $ 2 million and $ 4 million. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had \n\nTable of Contents \n\na recorded liability of $ 2 million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable NREPA liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount. \n\nConsumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites administered under CERCLA. CERCLA liability is joint and several. In 2010, Consumers received official notification from the EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party for cleanup of PCBs at the Kalamazoo River CERCLA site. The notification claimed that the EPA had reason to believe that Consumers disposed of PCBs and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing materials at portions of the site. In 2011, Consumers received a follow-up letter from the EPA requesting that Consumers agree to participate in a removal action plan along with several other companies for an area of lower Portage Creek, which is connected to the Kalamazoo River. All parties asked to participate in the removal action plan, including Consumers, declined to accept liability. Until further information is received from the EPA, Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability for cleanup of the river. \n\nBased on its experience, Consumers estimates its share of the total liability for known CERCLA sites to be between $ 3 million and $ 8 million. Various factors, including the number and creditworthiness of potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect Consumers&#8217; share of the total liability. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had a recorded liability of $ 3 million for its share of the total liability at these sites, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable CERCLA liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount. \n\nThe timing of payments related to Consumers&#8217; remediation and other response activities at its CERCLA and NREPA sites is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. A change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, different remediation techniques, the nature and extent of contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could affect its estimates of NREPA and CERCLA liability. \n\nLudington PCB: In 1998, during routine maintenance activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers removed part of the PCB material and replaced it with non&#8209;PCB material. Consumers has had several communications with the EPA regarding this matter, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome. \n\nLudington Plant Overhaul Contract Dispute: Consumers and DTE Electric, co-owners of Ludington, are parties to a 2010 engineering, procurement, and construction contract with TAES, under which TAES is charged with performing a major overhaul and upgrade of Ludington. TAES&#8217; performance has been unsatisfactory and resulted in overhaul project delays. Consumers and DTE Electric have demanded that TAES provide a comprehensive plan to resolve quality control concerns, including adherence to its warranty commitments and other contractual obligations. Consumers and DTE Electric have taken extensive efforts to resolve these issues with TAES, including a formal demand to TAES&#8217; parent, Toshiba Corporation, a non-affiliated company, under a parent guaranty it provided in the contract. TAES has not provided a comprehensive plan or otherwise met its performance obligations. \n\nIn order to enforce the contract, Consumers and DTE Electric filed a complaint against TAES and Toshiba Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in April 2022. In June 2022, TAES and Toshiba Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, along with an answer and counterclaims seeking approximately $ 15 million in damages related to payments allegedly owed under the parties&#8217; contract. As a co-owner of Ludington, Consumers would be liable for 51 percent of any such damages. In September 2022, the court denied the motion to dismiss filed by TAES and Toshiba Corporation. Consumers believes the counterclaims are without merit, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn November 2022, Consumers and DTE Electric jointly filed an application with the MPSC, requesting authority to defer as a regulatory asset the costs associated with repairing or replacing the defective work performed by TAES while the litigation with TAES and Toshiba Corporation moves forward; such costs would be offset by potential future litigation proceeds received from TAES or Toshiba Corporation. If this application is approved by the MPSC, Consumers and DTE Electric will have the opportunity to seek appropriate recovery and ratemaking treatment for amounts recorded as a regulatory asset following resolution of the litigation. \n\nJ.H. Campbell 3 Plant Retirement Contract Dispute: In May 2022, Consumers filed a complaint against Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative, Inc. in the Ottawa County Circuit Court and requested a ruling that Consumers has sole authority to decide to retire the J.H. Campbell 3 coal-fueled generating unit under the unit&#8217;s Joint Ownership and Operating Agreement. In July 2022, Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative, Inc. filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and a counterclaim seeking approximately $ 37 million in damages allegedly caused by Consumers&#8217; decision to retire the unit before the end of its useful life. In July 2022, Consumers filed a motion for summary disposition, which was heard in August 2022. In October 2022, the state circuit court judge found that Consumers may, in its sole discretion, retire the J.H. Campbell 3 coal-fueled generating unit, provided that Consumers continues to operate and make necessary improvements to the unit while the litigation concerning Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative, Inc.&#8217;s claim for damages is pending. Consumers believes Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative, Inc.&#8217;s claim has no merit, but cannot predict the final impact or outcome on this matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. \n\nConsumers Gas Utility Contingencies \n\nGas Environmental Matters: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under NREPA. These sites include 23 former MGP facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites, Consumers has no present ownership interest or may own only a portion of the original site. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Consumers had a recorded liability of $ 62 million for its remaining obligations for these sites. This amount represents the present value of long-term projected costs, using a discount rate of 2.57 percent and an inflation rate of 2.5 percent. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $ 67 million. Consumers expects to pay the following amounts for remediation and other response activity costs in each of the next five years: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Consumers Remediation and other response activity costs $ 5 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 31 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 1 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nConsumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect Consumers&#8217; estimates of annual response activity costs and the MGP liability. \n\nPursuant to orders issued by the MPSC, Consumers defers its MGP-related remediation costs and recovers them from its customers over a ten-year period. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had a regulatory asset of $ 108 million related to the MGP sites. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nConsumers estimates that its liability to perform remediation and other response activities at NREPA sites other than the MGP sites could reach $ 3 million. At December 31, 2022, Consumers had a recorded liability of less than $ 1 million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount. \n\nRay Compressor Station: On January 30, 2019, Consumers experienced a fire at the Ray Compressor Station, which resulted in the Ray Storage Field being off&#8209;line or operating at significantly reduced capacity, which negatively affected Consumers&#8217; natural gas supply and delivery capacity. This incident, which occurred during the extreme polar vortex weather condition, required Consumers to request voluntary reductions in customer load, to implement contingency gas supply purchases, and to implement a curtailment of natural gas deliveries for industrial and large commercial customers pursuant to Consumers&#8217; MPSC curtailment tariff. The curtailment and request for voluntary reductions of customer loads were canceled as of midnight, February 1, 2019. Consumers investigated the cause of the incident, and filed a report on the incident with the MPSC in April 2019. In response, the MPSC issued an order in July 2019, directing Consumers to file additional reports regarding the incident and to include detail of the resulting costs in a future rate proceeding. The compressor station is presently operating at full capacity. \n\nIn September 2020, the MPSC disallowed the recovery of $ 7 million in incremental gas purchases related to the fire. In February 2021, after the MPSC denied Consumers&#8217; petition for rehearing challenging this disallowance, Consumers filed an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2022, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision rejecting Consumers&#8217; appeal. Consumers plans to file an application for leave to appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court in February 2023. \n\nIn December 2021, Consumers filed a gas rate case with the MPSC that included a request for recovery of the capital expenditures incurred to restore and modify the compressor station. Consumers incurred capital expenditures of $ 17 million during 2020 and 2021 to restore and modify the compressor station. \n\nDuring 2022, Consumers received insurance proceeds of $ 13 million, representing recovery of costs incurred to restore the compressor station and incremental gas purchases related to the fire. Consumers had recognized the insurance recovery during 2021. \n\nIn June 2022, Consumers, the MPSC Staff, and other intervenors reached a settlement of the gas rate case and the MPSC approved it in July 2022. As a part of the settlement agreement, Consumers agreed, at this time, to not seek recovery of the capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds, related to restoring and modifying the Ray Compressor Station. As a result, Consumers recorded an impairment charge of $ 10 million within maintenance and other operating expenses on its consolidated statements of income in 2022. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nGuarantees \n\nPresented in the following table are CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; guarantees at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Guarantee Description Issue Date Expiration Date Maximum Obligation Carrying Amount CMS Energy, including Consumers Indemnity obligations from sale of membership interests in VIEs 1 \n\nvarious indefinite $ 325 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Indemnity obligations from stock and asset sale agreements 2 \n\nvarious indefinite 226 &#160; 3 &#160; Guarantee 3 \n\n2011 indefinite 30 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Consumers Guarantee 3 \n\n2011 indefinite $ 30 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 These obligations arose from the sale of membership interests in NWO Holdco and Aviator Wind to tax equity investors. NorthStar Clean Energy provided certain indemnity obligations that protect the tax equity investors against losses incurred as a result of breaches of representations and warranties under the associated limited liability company agreements. These obligations are generally capped at an amount equal to the tax equity investor&#8217;s capital contributions plus a specified return, less any distributions and tax benefits it receives, in connection with its membership interest. For any indemnity obligations related to Aviator Wind, NorthStar Clean Energy would recover 49 percent of any amounts paid to the tax equity investor from the other owner of Aviator Wind Equity Holdings. Additionally, Aviator Wind holds insurance coverage that would partially protect against losses incurred as a result of certain failures to qualify for production tax credits. For further details on NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s ownership interest in NWO Holdco and Aviator Wind, see Note 18, Variable Interest Entities. \n\n2 These obligations arose from stock and asset sale agreements under which CMS Energy or a subsidiary of CMS Energy indemnified the purchaser for losses resulting from various matters, including claims related to taxes and breaches of representations and warranties. The maximum obligation amount is mostly related to an Equatorial Guinea tax claim and an indemnity provided in connection with the sale of EnerBank to Regions Bank. For further details on the sale, see Note 19, Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations . \n\n3 This obligation comprises a guarantee provided by Consumers to the U.S. Department of Energy in connection with a settlement agreement regarding damages resulting from the department&#8217;s failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants formerly owned by Consumers. \n\nAdditionally, in the normal course of business, CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMS Energy have entered into various agreements containing tax and other indemnity provisions for which they are unable to estimate the maximum potential obligation. CMS Energy and Consumers consider the likelihood that they would be required to perform or incur substantial losses related to these indemnities and those disclosed in the table to be remote. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nIn addition to the matters disclosed in this Note and Note 2, Regulatory Matters, there are certain other lawsuits and administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, as well as unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of business to which CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMS Energy are parties. These other lawsuits, proceedings, and unasserted claims may involve personal injury, property damage, contracts, environmental matters, federal and state taxes, rates, licensing, employment, and other matters. Further, \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers occasionally self-report certain regulatory non&#8209;compliance matters that may or may not eventually result in administrative proceedings. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that the outcome of any one of these proceedings and potential claims will not have a material negative effect on their consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. \n\nContractual Commitments \n\nPurchase Obligations: Purchase obligations arise from long-term contracts for the purchase of commodities and related services, plant purchase commitments, and construction and service agreements.

Several decisions from FERC suggest that, under a variety of circumstances, dividends from Consumers on its common stock would not be limited to amounts in Consumers&#8217; retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay dividends on its common stock in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and would be subject to a formal regulatory filing process. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Consumers paid $ 769 million in dividends on its common stock to CMS Energy. \n\nCapitalization: The authorized capital stock of CMS Energy consists of: \n\n&#8226; 350 million shares of CMS Energy Common Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share \n\n&#8226; 10 million shares of CMS Energy Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share \n\nIssuance of Common Stock: Under an existing equity offering program, CMS Energy may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $ 500 million in privately negotiated transactions, in &#8220;at the market&#8221; offerings, through forward sales transactions, or otherwise.

When measuring fair value, CMS Energy and Consumers are required to incorporate all assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value according to their observability in the market. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\n&#8226; Level 2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other than Level 1 prices. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in inactive markets, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. \n\n&#8226; Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect CMS Energy&#8217;s or Consumers&#8217; own assumptions about how market participants would value their assets and liabilities. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers classify fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \n\nPresented in the following table are CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions CMS Energy, including Consumers Consumers December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Assets 1 \n\nRestricted cash equivalents $ 18 &#160; $ 24 &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 22 &#160; Nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets 24 &#160; 27 &#160; 18 &#160; 21 &#160; Derivative instruments 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Total assets $ 44 &#160; $ 53 &#160; $ 37 &#160; $ 45 &#160; Liabilities 1 \n\nNonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities $ 24 &#160; $ 27 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 21 &#160; Derivative instruments &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total liabilities $ 24 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 21 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 All assets and liabilities were classified as Level 1 with the exception of derivative contracts, which were classified as Level 2 or Level 3. \n\nRestricted Cash Equivalents: Restricted cash equivalents consist of money market funds with daily liquidity. For further details, see Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies. \n\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities: The nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of mutual funds, which are valued using the daily quoted net asset values. CMS Energy and Consumers value their nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities based on the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect the amount owed to the plan participants in accordance with their investment elections. CMS Energy and Consumers report the assets in other non&#8209;current assets and the liabilities in other non&#8209;current liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets. \n\nDerivative Instruments: CMS Energy and Consumers value their derivative instruments using either a market approach that incorporates information from market transactions, or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows to a present value amount. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; derivatives are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. \n\nThe derivatives classified as Level 2 were interest rate swaps at CMS Energy, which were valued using market-based inputs. CMS Energy used interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk on certain long&#8209;term debt obligations. \n\nA subsidiary of NorthStar Clean Energy used floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with future interest payments on certain long&#8209;term variable-rate debt. The interest rate swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges of the future variability of interest payments on the debt. In June 2022, NorthStar Clean Energy repaid the hedged debt and terminated the related interest rate swaps. As a result, the associated unrecognized losses recorded in other comprehensive income were recognized in interest on long-term debt on CMS Energy&#8217;s consolidated statements of income; this amount was immaterial. NorthStar Clean Energy also had other interest rate swaps that economically hedged interest rate risk on debt, but that did not qualify for cash flow hedge \n\nTable of Contents \n\naccounting. These swaps were also terminated in June 2022; the amounts associated with these swaps were not material for the periods presented. \n\nThe majority of derivatives classified as Level 3 are FTRs held by Consumers. Due to the lack of quoted pricing information, Consumers determines the fair value of its FTRs based on Consumers&#8217; average historical settlements. There was no material activity within the Level 3 categories of assets and liabilities during the periods presented. \n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \n\nPresented in the following table are Consumers&#8217; assets, by level within the fair value hierarchy, reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Gains (Losses) Assets held for sale $ &#8212; &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 4 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2021, Consumers wrote down fleet assets held for sale from their carrying amount of $ 19 million to their fair value, less selling costs, of $ 15 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $ 4 million, which was recorded within maintenance and other operating expenses on its consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. The fair value was determined based on the market prices of similar fleet vehicles at the time of measurement. These vehicles were subsequently sold at an amount exceeding their recorded fair value in 2022. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 2, Regulatory Matters. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n6: Financial Instruments \n\nPresented in the following table are the carrying amounts and fair values, by level within the fair value hierarchy, of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value.

The cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, overhead such as pension and other benefits, and AFUDC, if applicable. Consumers&#8217; plant, property, and equipment is generally recoverable through its general ratemaking process. \n\nWith the exception of utility property for which the remaining book value has been securitized, mothballed utility property stays in rate base and continues to be depreciated at the same rate as before the mothball period. When utility property is retired or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, Consumers records the original cost to accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal, net of salvage. CMS Energy and Consumers recognize gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of non&#8209;regulated assets in income. Consumers records cost of removal collected from customers, but not spent, as a regulatory liability. \n\nSoftware: CMS Energy and Consumers capitalize the costs to purchase and develop internal-use computer software. These costs are expensed evenly over the estimated useful life of the internal-use computer software. If computer software is integral to computer hardware, then its cost is capitalized and depreciated with the hardware. \n\nAFUDC: Consumers capitalizes AFUDC on regulated major construction projects. AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and authorized return-on-equity funds used to finance construction additions. Consumers records the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for the amount representing the borrowed funds component and as other income for the equity funds component on the consolidated \n\nTable of Contents \n\nstatements of income. When construction is completed and the property is placed in service, Consumers depreciates and recovers the capitalized AFUDC from customers over the life of the related asset.

In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers account for several of their PPAs as leases. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers do not record right-of-use assets or lease liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets for rentals with lease terms of 12 months or less, most of which are for the lease of real estate and service vehicles. Lease expense for these rentals is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers include future payments for all renewal options, fair market value extensions, and buyout provisions reasonably certain of exercise in their measurement of lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. In addition, certain leases for service vehicles contain end-of-lease adjustment clauses based on proceeds received from the sale or disposition of the vehicles. CMS Energy and Consumers also include executory costs in the measurement of their right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, except for maintenance costs related to their coal-carrying railcar leases. \n\nMost of Consumers&#8217; PPAs contain provisions at the end of the initial contract terms to renew the agreements annually under mutually agreed&#8209;upon terms at the time of renewal.

In addition to fixed payments, these agreements have variable payments based on energy delivered. For the year ended December 31, 2022, lease revenue from these power sales agreements was $ 240 million, which included variable lease payments of $ 191 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, lease revenue from these power sales agreements was $ 194 million, which included variable lease payments of $ 138 million. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table are the minimum rental payments to be received under CMS Energy&#8217;s non&#8209;cancelable operating leases: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions December 31, 2022 2023 $ 43 &#160; 2024 43 &#160; 2025 44 &#160; 2026 18 &#160; Total minimum lease payments $ 148 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nConsumers has a natural gas transportation agreement with a subsidiary of CMS Energy that extends through 2038, related to a pipeline owned by Consumers. This agreement is accounted for as a direct finance lease and will automatically extend annually unless terminated by either party. The effects of the lease are eliminated on CMS Energy&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. \n\nMinimum rental payments to be received under Consumers&#8217; direct financing leases are less than $ 1 million for each of the next five years and $ 8 million for the years thereafter. The lease receivable was $ 6 million as of December 31, 2022, which does not include unearned income of $ 7 million. \n\n9: Asset Retirement Obligations \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMS Energy and Consumers have not recorded liabilities associated with the closure of certain gas wells that have an indeterminate life. CMS Energy and Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have immaterial cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected present-value technique that reflects assumptions about costs and inflation, and uses a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to discount the expected cash flows. CMS Energy&#8217;s ARO liabilities are primarily at Consumers. \n\nPresented below are the categories of assets that CMS Energy and Consumers have legal obligations to remove at the end of their useful lives and for which they have an ARO liability recorded: \n\n##TABLE_START ARO Description In-Service Date Long-Lived Assets Closure of coal ash disposal areas various Generating plants coal ash areas Gas distribution cut, purge, and cap various Gas distribution mains and services Asbestos abatement 1973 Electric and gas utility plant Closure of renewable generation assets various Wind and solar generation facilities Gas wells plug and abandon various Gas transmission and storage ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following tables are the changes in CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; ARO liabilities: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Company and ARO Description ARO Liability 12/31/2021 Incurred Settled Accretion Cash Flow Revisions 1 \n\nARO Liability 12/31/2022 CMS Energy, including Consumers Consumers $ 605 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ ( 39 ) $ 27 &#160; $ 128 &#160; $ 722 &#160; Renewable generation assets 23 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 24 &#160; Total CMS Energy $ 628 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ ( 39 ) $ 28 &#160; $ 128 &#160; $ 746 &#160; Consumers Coal ash disposal areas $ 157 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 20 ) $ 7 &#160; $ 128 &#160; $ 272 &#160; Gas distribution cut, purge, and cap 282 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 11 ) 15 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 287 &#160; Asbestos abatement 38 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 39 &#160; Renewable generation assets 93 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 95 &#160; Gas wells plug and abandon 35 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 7 ) 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 29 &#160; Total Consumers $ 605 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ ( 39 ) $ 27 &#160; $ 128 &#160; $ 722 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Increase was attributable to a proposed change for closure work at the J.H.

These plans include: \n\n&#8226; non&#8209;contributory, qualified DB Pension Plans (closed to new non&#8209;union participants as of July 1, 2003 and closed to new union participants as of September 1, 2005) \n\n&#8226; a non&#8209;contributory, qualified DCCP for employees hired on or after July 1, 2003 \n\n&#8226; benefits to certain management employees under a non&#8209;contributory, nonqualified DB SERP (closed to new participants as of March 31, 2006) \n\n&#8226; a non&#8209;contributory, nonqualified DC SERP for certain management employees hired or promoted on or after April 1, 2006 \n\n&#8226; a contributory, qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan \n\n&#8226; health care and life insurance benefits under an OPEB Plan \n\nDB Pension Plans: Participants in the pension plans include present and former employees of CMS Energy and Consumers, including certain present and former affiliates and subsidiaries. Pension plan trust assets are not distinguishable by company. Effective December 31, 2017, CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; then-existing pension plan was amended to include only retired and former employees already covered; this amended plan is referred to as DB Pension Plan B. Also effective December 31, 2017, active employees were moved to a newly created pension plan, referred to as DB Pension Plan A, whose benefits mirror those provided under DB Pension Plan B. Maintaining separate plans for the two groups allows CMS Energy and Consumers to employ a more targeted investment strategy and provides additional opportunities to mitigate risk and volatility. \n\nIn March 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers determined that 2022 lump-sum payments to retired employees under DB Pension Plan A would exceed the plan&#8217;s service cost and interest cost components of net periodic cost for the year. These lump-sum payments constitute pension plan liability settlements; once such settlements meet the service and interest cost threshold, recognition in earnings is required. As a result, in accordance with GAAP, CMS Energy, including Consumers, performed a remeasurement of DB Pension Plan A at the end of each quarter in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, CMS Energy, including Consumers, recognized a settlement loss of $ 22 million; $ 21 million of this amount was deferred as a regulatory asset. Consumers recognized a settlement loss of $ 21 million, all of which was deferred as a regulatory asset. CMS Energy and Consumers will amortize the regulatory asset over eight years . \n\nDCCP: CMS Energy and Consumers provide an employer contribution to the DCCP 401(k) plan for employees hired on or after July 1, 2003. The contribution ranges from five percent to ten percent of base pay, depending on years of service and employee class. Employees are not required to contribute in order to receive the plan&#8217;s employer contribution. DCCP expense for CMS Energy, including Consumers, was $ 48 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $ 41 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $ 31 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. DCCP expense for Consumers was $ 48 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $ 41 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $ 31 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDB SERP: The DB SERP is a nonqualified plan as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. DB SERP benefits are paid from a rabbi trust established in 1988. The trust assets are not considered plan assets under ASC 715. DB SERP rabbi trust earnings are taxable. Presented in the following table are the fair values of trust assets and ABO for CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; DB SERP: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 CMS Energy, including Consumers Trust assets $ 137 &#160; $ 142 &#160; ABO 118 &#160; 149 &#160; Consumers Trust assets $ 101 &#160; $ 104 &#160; ABO 85 &#160; 108 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNeither CMS Energy nor Consumers made any contributions to the DB SERP in 2022 or 2021. \n\nDC SERP: On April 1, 2006, CMS Energy and Consumers implemented a DC SERP and froze further new participation in the DB SERP. The DC SERP provides participants benefits ranging from five percent to 15 percent of total compensation. The DC SERP requires a minimum of five years of participation before vesting. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; contributions to the plan, if any, are placed in a grantor trust. For CMS Energy and Consumers, trust assets were $ 12 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 13 million at December 31, 2021. DC SERP assets are included in other non&#8209;current assets on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; consolidated balance sheets. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; DC SERP expense was $ 1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $ 2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\n401(k) Plan: The 401(k) plan employer match equals four to six percent of employee eligible contributions based on an employee&#8217;s wages and class. The total 401(k) plan cost for CMS Energy, including Consumers, was $ 44 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $ 31 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $ 29 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The total 401(k) plan cost for Consumers was $ 43 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $ 31 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $ 29 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\nOPEB Plan: Participants in the OPEB Plan include all regular full-time employees covered by the employee health care plan on the day before retirement from either CMS Energy or Consumers at age 55 or older with at least ten full years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time employees who qualify for disability retirement under the DB Pension Plans or are disabled and covered by the DCCP and who have 15 years of applicable continuous service may also participate in the OPEB Plan. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption that costs would increase 6.50 percent in 2023 and 6.25 percent in 2022 for those under 65 and would increase 6.75 percent in 2023 and 2022 for those over 65. The rate of increase was assumed to decline to 4.75 percent by 2032 and thereafter for all retirees. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAssumptions: Presented in the following table are the weighted-average assumptions used in CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; retirement benefit plans to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 2020 CMS Energy, including Consumers \n\nWeighted average for benefit obligations 1 \n\nDiscount rate 2 \n\nDB Pension Plan A 5.24 &#160; % 3.02 &#160; % 2.73 &#160; % DB Pension Plan B 5.14 &#160; 2.79 &#160; 2.41 &#160; DB SERP 5.13 &#160; 2.78 &#160; 2.40 &#160; OPEB Plan 5.21 &#160; 2.99 &#160; 2.69 &#160; Rate of compensation increase DB Pension Plan A 3.60 &#160; 3.60 &#160; 3.70 &#160; DB SERP 5.50 &#160; 5.50 &#160; 5.50 &#160; Weighted average for net periodic benefit cost 1 \n\nService cost discount rate 2,3 \n\nDB Pension Plan A 3.09 &#160; % 2.83 &#160; % 3.44 &#160; % DB SERP 3.09 &#160; 2.84 &#160; 3.46 &#160; OPEB Plan 3.23 &#160; 3.03 &#160; 3.57 &#160; Interest cost discount rate 2,3 \n\nDB Pension Plan A 2.44 &#160; 1.97 &#160; 2.92 &#160; DB Pension Plan B 2.21 &#160; 1.70 &#160; 2.74 &#160; DB SERP 2.21 &#160; 1.72 &#160; 2.74 &#160; OPEB Plan 2.45 &#160; 1.99 &#160; 2.88 &#160; Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 4 \n\nDB Pension Plans 6.50 &#160; 6.75 &#160; 6.75 &#160; OPEB Plan 6.50 &#160; 6.75 &#160; 6.75 &#160; Rate of compensation increase DB Pension Plan A 3.60 &#160; 3.70 &#160; 3.50 &#160; DB SERP 5.50 &#160; 5.50 &#160; 5.50 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 The mortality assumption for benefit obligations was based on the Pri-2012 Mortality Table, with improvement scale MP-2021 for 2022 and 2021 and improvement scale MP-2020 for 2020. The mortality assumption for net periodic benefit cost was based on the Pri-2012 Mortality Table, with improvement scales MP-2021 for 2022, MP-2020 for 2021, and MP-2019 for 2020. \n\n2 The discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from a yield-curve analysis. This analysis incorporated the projected benefit payments specific to CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan and the yields on high-quality corporate bonds rated Aa or better. \n\n3 CMS Energy and Consumers have elected to use a full-yield-curve approach in the estimation of service cost and interest cost; this approach applies individual spot rates along the yield curve to future projected benefit payments based on the time of payment. \n\n4 CMS Energy and Consumers determined the long-term rate of return using historical market returns, the present and expected future economic environment, the capital market principles of risk and return, and the expert opinions of individuals and firms with financial market knowledge. CMS Energy and Consumers \n\nTable of Contents \n\nconsidered the asset allocation of the portfolio in forecasting the future expected total return of the portfolio. The goal was to determine a long-term rate of return that could be incorporated into the planning of future cash flow requirements in conjunction with the change in the liability. Annually, CMS Energy and Consumers review for reasonableness and appropriateness the forecasted returns for various classes of assets used to construct an expected return model. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; expected long-term rate of return on the assets of the DB Pension Plans was 6.50 percent in 2022. The actual return (loss) on the assets of the DB Pension Plans was ( 15.9 ) percent in 2022, 12.0 percent in 2021, and 13.6 percent in 2020. \n\nCosts: Presented in the following table are the costs (credits) and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations incurred in CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; retirement benefit plans: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions DB Pension Plans and DB SERP OPEB Plan Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 CMS Energy, including Consumers Net periodic cost (credit) Service cost $ 41 &#160; $ 53 &#160; $ 50 &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 16 &#160; Interest cost 84 &#160; 63 &#160; 83 &#160; 28 &#160; 23 &#160; 33 &#160; Settlement loss 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 206 ) ( 208 ) ( 191 ) ( 115 ) ( 109 ) ( 100 ) Amortization of: Net loss 40 &#160; 100 &#160; 95 &#160; 1 &#160; 8 &#160; 15 &#160; Prior service cost (credit) 4 &#160; 4 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 51 ) ( 53 ) ( 56 ) Settlement loss 9 &#160; 6 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net periodic cost (credit) $ ( 27 ) $ 19 &#160; $ 41 &#160; $ ( 120 ) $ ( 113 ) $ ( 92 ) Consumers Net periodic cost (credit) Service cost $ 39 &#160; $ 51 &#160; $ 49 &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 15 &#160; Interest cost 79 &#160; 59 &#160; 78 &#160; 27 &#160; 23 &#160; 31 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 194 ) ( 197 ) ( 181 ) ( 107 ) ( 102 ) ( 93 ) Amortization of: Net loss 37 &#160; 96 &#160; 90 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; 15 &#160; Prior service cost (credit) 4 &#160; 4 &#160; 1 &#160; ( 50 ) ( 51 ) ( 54 ) Settlement loss 9 &#160; 6 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net periodic cost (credit) $ ( 26 ) $ 19 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ ( 113 ) $ ( 105 ) $ ( 86 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers amortize net gains and losses in excess of ten percent of the greater of the PBO or the MRV over the average remaining service period for DB Pension Plan A and the OPEB Plan and over the average remaining life expectancy of participants for DB Pension Plan B. For DB Pension Plan A, the estimated period of amortization of gains and losses was eight years for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. For DB Pension Plan B, the estimated period of amortization of gains and losses was 18 years for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and 19 years for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the OPEB Plan, the estimated amortization period was nine years for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nPrior service cost (credit) amortization is established in the year in which the prior service cost (credit) first occurred, and is based on the same amortization period for all future years until the prior service cost (credit) is fully amortized. CMS Energy and Consumers had new prior service costs for DB Pension Plan A in 2020. The estimated period of amortization of these new prior service costs is eight years . \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers determine the MRV for the assets of the DB Pension Plans as the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not be admitted into the MRV until future years. CMS Energy and Consumers reflect each year&#8217;s gain or loss in the MRV in equal amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the original amount was determined. CMS Energy and Consumers determine the MRV for OPEB Plan assets as the fair value of assets on the measurement date. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nReconciliations: Presented in the following table are reconciliations of the funded status of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; retirement benefit plans with their retirement benefit plans&#8217; liabilities: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions DB Pension Plans DB SERP OPEB Plan Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 CMS Energy, including Consumers Benefit obligation at beginning of period $ 3,070 &#160; $ 3,266 &#160; $ 149 &#160; $ 160 &#160; $ 1,166 &#160; $ 1,205 &#160; Service cost 41 &#160; 53 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; 18 &#160; Interest cost 81 &#160; 60 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 28 &#160; 23 &#160; Plan amendments &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Actuarial gain ( 811 ) 1 \n\n( 108 ) 1 \n\n( 25 ) ( 4 ) ( 274 ) 1 \n\n( 32 ) 1 \n\nBenefits paid ( 212 ) ( 201 ) ( 10 ) ( 10 ) ( 48 ) ( 53 ) Benefit obligation at end of period $ 2,169 &#160; $ 3,070 &#160; $ 117 &#160; $ 149 &#160; $ 889 &#160; $ 1,166 &#160; Plan assets at fair value at beginning of period $ 3,599 &#160; $ 3,402 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,787 &#160; $ 1,645 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 567 ) 398 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 294 ) 194 &#160; Company contribution &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 10 &#160; 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Actual benefits paid ( 212 ) ( 201 ) ( 10 ) ( 10 ) ( 47 ) ( 52 ) Plan assets at fair value at end of period $ 2,820 &#160; $ 3,599 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,446 &#160; $ 1,787 &#160; Funded status $ 651 &#160; 2 \n\n$ 529 &#160; 2 \n\n$ ( 117 ) $ ( 149 ) $ 557 &#160; $ 621 &#160; Consumers Benefit obligation at beginning of period $ 109 &#160; $ 117 &#160; $ 1,122 &#160; $ 1,158 &#160; Service cost &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; 17 &#160; Interest cost 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 27 &#160; 23 &#160; Plan amendments &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Actuarial gain ( 19 ) ( 3 ) ( 265 ) 1 \n\n( 30 ) 1 \n\nBenefits paid ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 45 ) ( 51 ) Benefit obligation at end of period $ 85 &#160; $ 109 &#160; $ 856 &#160; $ 1,122 &#160; Plan assets at fair value at beginning of period $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,668 &#160; $ 1,535 &#160; Actual return on plan assets &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 273 ) 182 &#160; Company contribution 7 &#160; 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Actual benefits paid ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 45 ) ( 49 ) Plan assets at fair value at end of period $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,350 &#160; $ 1,668 &#160; Funded status $ ( 85 ) $ ( 109 ) $ 494 &#160; $ 546 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 The actuarial gains for 2022 and 2021 for the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan were primarily the result of higher discount rates. \n\n2 The total funded status of the DB Pension Plans attributable to Consumers, based on an allocation of expenses, was $ 632 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 510 million at December 31, 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table is the classification of CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; retirement benefit plans&#8217; assets and liabilities: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions December 31 2022 2021 CMS Energy, including Consumers Non-current assets DB Pension Plans $ 651 &#160; $ 529 &#160; OPEB Plan 557 &#160; 621 &#160; Current liabilities DB SERP 10 &#160; 10 &#160; Non-current liabilities DB SERP 107 &#160; 139 &#160; Consumers Non-current assets DB Pension Plans $ 632 &#160; $ 510 &#160; OPEB Plan 494 &#160; 546 &#160; Current liabilities DB SERP 7 &#160; 7 &#160; Non-current liabilities DB SERP 78 &#160; 102 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe ABO for the DB Pension Plans was $ 2.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 2.7 billion at December 31, 2021.

These securities are valued based on quoted market prices. \n\nCorporate Debt: Corporate debt investments consist of investment grade bonds of U.S. issuers from diverse industries. These securities are valued based on quoted market prices, when available, or yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nState and Municipal Bonds: State and municipal bonds are valued using a matrix-pricing model that incorporates Level 2 market-based information. The fair value of the bonds is derived from various observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported securities trades, broker/dealer quotes, bond ratings, and general information on market movements for investment grade state and municipal securities normally considered by market participants when pricing such debt securities. \n\nForeign Corporate Bonds: Foreign corporate debt securities are valued based on quoted market prices, when available, or on yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. \n\nCommon Stocks: Common stocks in the OPEB Plan consist of equity securities that are actively managed and tracked to the S&#38;P 500 Index. These securities are valued at their quoted closing prices. \n\nMutual Funds: Mutual funds represent shares in registered investment companies that are priced based on the daily quoted net asset values that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in the funds. \n\nPooled Funds: Pooled funds include both common and collective trust funds as well as special funds that contain only employee benefit plan assets from two or more unrelated benefit plans. These funds primarily consist of U.S. and foreign equity securities, but also include U.S. and foreign fixed-income securities and multi-asset investments. Since these investments are valued at their net asset value as a practical expedient, they are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nAsset Allocations: Presented in the following table are the investment components of the assets of CMS Energy&#8217;s DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START DB Pension Plans OPEB Plan Equity securities 38.0 &#160; % 55.0 &#160; % Fixed-income securities 47.0 &#160; 38.0 &#160; Real asset investments 11.0 &#160; 5.0 &#160; Cash and cash equivalents 4.0 &#160; 2.0 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % 100.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s target 2022 asset allocation for the assets of the DB Pension Plans was 50 &#8209;percent equity, 40 &#8209;percent fixed income, and ten &#8209;percent real assets. \n\nCMS Energy established union and non&#8209;union VEBA trusts to fund future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers and through direct contributions from the non&#8209;utility subsidiaries. CMS Energy&#8217;s target 2022 asset allocation for the health trusts was 51 &#8209;percent equity, 39 &#8209;percent fixed income, and ten &#8209;percent real assets. CMS Energy&#8217;s target asset allocation for the life trusts was 53 &#8209;percent equity, 32 &#8209;percent fixed income, and 15 &#8209;percent multi-asset investments. \n\nThe goal of these target allocations was to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plans. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&#38;P 500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&#38;P MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers, as well as high-yield and global bond funds. Real asset investments are diversified across real estate investment trusts, public infrastructure, and public resource equity. Multi-asset investments are global tactical asset allocations. CMS Energy uses annual liability measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to the portfolio allocations. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nContributions: Contributions comprise required amounts and discretionary contributions. Neither CMS Energy nor Consumers made any contributions in 2022 or 2021, or plans to contribute to the DB Pension Plans or OPEB Plan in 2023. Actual future contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the participants of the DB Pension Plans and OPEB Plan. CMS Energy and Consumers will, at a minimum, contribute to the plans as needed to comply with federal funding requirements. \n\nBenefit Payments: Presented in the following table are the expected benefit payments for each of the next five years and the five &#8209; year period thereafter: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions DB Pension Plans DB SERP OPEB Plan CMS Energy, including Consumers 2023 $ 160 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 55 &#160; 2024 158 &#160; 10 &#160; 57 &#160; 2025 161 &#160; 10 &#160; 58 &#160; 2026 160 &#160; 10 &#160; 59 &#160; 2027 159 &#160; 10 &#160; 60 &#160; 2028-2032 790 &#160; 45 &#160; 312 &#160; Consumers 2023 $ 150 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 52 &#160; 2024 149 &#160; 7 &#160; 54 &#160; 2025 151 &#160; 7 &#160; 55 &#160; 2026 151 &#160; 7 &#160; 56 &#160; 2027 150 &#160; 7 &#160; 58 &#160; 2028-2032 745 &#160; 30 &#160; 298 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCollective Bargaining Agreements: At December 31, 2022, unions represented 41 percent of CMS Energy&#8217;s employees and 42 percent of Consumers&#8217; employees. The UWUA represents Consumers&#8217; operating, maintenance, construction, and customer contact center employees. The USW represents Zeeland plant employees. The UWUA and USW agreements expire in 2025. \n\n11: Stock-based Compensation \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers provide a PISP to officers, employees, and non&#8209;employee directors based on their contributions to the successful management of the company. The PISP has a ten &#8209; year term, expiring in May 2030. \n\nIn 2022, all awards were in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units. The PISP also allows for unrestricted common stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom shares, performance units, and incentive options, none of which was granted in 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\nShares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, or performance units may not exceed 6.5 million shares from June 2020 through May 2030. CMS Energy and Consumers may issue awards of up to 5,417,727 shares of common stock under the PISP as of December 31, 2022. Shares for which payment or exercise is in cash, as well as shares that expire, terminate, or are canceled or forfeited, may be awarded or granted again under the PISP. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAll awards under the PISP vest fully upon death. Upon a change of control of CMS Energy or termination under an officer separation agreement, the awards will vest in accordance with specific officer agreements. If stated in the award, for restricted stock recipients who terminate employment due to retirement or disability, a pro-rata portion of the award will vest upon termination, with any market-based award also contingent upon the outcome of the market condition and any performance-based award contingent upon the outcome of the performance condition. The pro-rata portion is equal to the portion of the service period served between the award grant date and the employee&#8217;s termination date. The remaining portion of the awards will be forfeited. All awards for directors vest fully upon retirement. Restricted shares may be forfeited if employment terminates for any other reason or if the minimum service requirements are not met, as described in the award document. \n\nRestricted Stock Awards: Restricted stock awards for employees under the PISP are in the form of performance-based, market-based, and time-lapse restricted stock. Award recipients receive shares of CMS Energy common stock that have dividend and voting rights. The dividends on time-lapse restricted stock are paid in cash or in CMS Energy common stock. The dividends on performance-based and market-based restricted stock are paid in restricted shares equal to the value of the dividends. These additional restricted shares are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying restricted stock shares. \n\nPerformance-based restricted stock vesting is contingent on meeting at least a 36 &#8209; month service requirement and a performance condition. The performance condition is based on an adjusted measure of CMS Energy&#8217;s EPS growth relative to a peer group over a three &#8209; year period. The awards granted in 2022, 2021, and 2020 require a 38 &#8209; month service period. Market-based restricted stock vesting is generally contingent on meeting a three-year service requirement and a market condition. The market condition is based on a comparison of CMS Energy&#8217;s total shareholder return with the median total shareholder return of a peer group over the same three &#8209; year period. Depending on the outcome of the performance condition or the market condition, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from zero to 200 percent of the initial grant. Time-lapse restricted stock generally vests after a service period of three years . \n\nRestricted Stock Units: In 2022, 2021, and 2020, CMS Energy and Consumers granted restricted stock units to certain non&#8209;employee directors who elected to defer their restricted stock awards. The restricted stock units generally vest after a service period of one year or, if earlier, at the next annual meeting. The restricted stock units will be distributed to the recipients as shares in accordance with the directors&#8217; deferral agreements. Restricted stock units do not have voting rights, but do have dividend rights. In lieu of cash dividend payments, the dividends on restricted stock units are paid in additional units equal to the value of the dividends. These additional restricted stock units are subject to the same vesting and distribution conditions as the underlying restricted stock units.

For performance-based awards, CMS Energy and Consumers estimate the number of shares expected to vest at the end of the performance period based on the probable achievement of the performance objective. Performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards have graded vesting features for retirement-eligible employees, and CMS Energy and Consumers recognize expense for those awards on a graded vesting schedule over the required service period. Expense for performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards for non&#8209;retirement-eligible employees and time-lapse awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period. \n\nThe fair value of performance-based and time-lapse restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the price of CMS Energy&#8217;s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based restricted stock awards is calculated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMS Energy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMS Energy common stock. The risk-free rate for valuation of the market-based restricted stock awards was based on the three &#8209; year U.S. Treasury yield at the award grant date. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table are the most significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the market-based restricted stock awards: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Expected volatility 27.3 &#160; % 27.6 &#160; % 14.2 &#160; % Expected dividend yield 2.8 &#160; 2.8 &#160; 2.4 &#160; Risk-free rate 1.4 &#160; 0.2 &#160; 1.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPresented in the following table is the weighted-average grant-date fair value of all awards under the PISP: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 CMS Energy, including Consumers Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share Restricted stock granted $ 48.69 &#160; $ 43.52 &#160; $ 45.56 &#160; Restricted stock units granted 56.13 &#160; 54.11 &#160; 49.76 &#160; Consumers Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share Restricted stock granted $ 48.57 &#160; $ 42.85 &#160; $ 45.53 &#160; Restricted stock units granted 56.07 &#160; 53.93 &#160; 49.70 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPresented in the following table are amounts related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 CMS Energy, including Consumers Fair value of shares that vested during the year $ 27 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 22 &#160; Compensation expense recognized 26 &#160; 22 &#160; 11 &#160; Income tax benefit recognized &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 3 &#160; Consumers Fair value of shares that vested during the year $ 25 &#160; $ 24 &#160; $ 21 &#160; Compensation expense recognized 25 &#160; 21 &#160; 10 &#160; Income tax benefit recognized &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022, $ 28 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for CMS Energy, including Consumers, and $ 27 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for Consumers.

As a result, Consumers recognized a $ 1 million decrease in the credit, net of reserves for uncertain tax positions. There was no impact at the consolidated level. In 2020, CMS Energy finalized a study of research and development tax credits for tax years 2012 through 2018. As a result, in 2020, CMS Energy, including Consumers, recognized a $ 9 million increase in the credit, net of reserves for uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, $ 8 million was recognized at Consumers. \n\n4 In 2020, the IRS issued a decision restoring alternative minimum tax credit refunds sequestered in years prior to 2018. As a result, in 2020, CMS Energy recognized a $ 9 million income tax benefit for sequestered amounts related to its 2017 tax return.

CMS Energy and Consumers expect to utilize fully their tax loss and credit carryforwards for which no valuation allowance has been provided. It is reasonably possible that further adjustments will be made to the valuation allowances within one year. \n\nPresented in the following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax benefits: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 CMS Energy, including Consumers Balance at beginning of period $ 27 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 23 &#160; Additions for current-year tax positions 1 &#160; 2 &#160; 1 &#160; Additions for prior-year tax positions 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; Reductions for prior-year tax positions ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) Balance at end of period $ 28 &#160; $ 27 &#160; $ 25 &#160; Consumers Balance at beginning of period $ 34 &#160; $ 31 &#160; $ 34 &#160; Additions for current-year tax positions 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 1 &#160; Additions for prior-year tax positions 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Reductions for prior-year tax positions ( 2 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 8 ) Balance at end of period $ 36 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 31 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIf recognized, all of these uncertain tax benefits would affect CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; annual effective tax rates in future years. One uncertain tax benefit relates to the methodology of state apportionment for Consumers&#8217; electricity sales to MISO. The Michigan Tax Tribunal heard oral arguments on this methodology during 2022. A final conclusion is not anticipated in the next 12 months. \n\nCMS Energy and Consumers recognize accrued interest and penalties, where applicable, as part of income tax expense. CMS Energy, including Consumers, recognized no interest or penalties for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. CMS Energy&#8217;s federal income tax returns for 2019 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS. CMS Energy&#8217;s Michigan Corporate Income Tax returns for 2013 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the State of Michigan. CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that their accrued tax liabilities at December 31, 2022 were adequate for all years. \n\n13: Earnings Per Share&#8212;CMS Energy \n\nPresented in the following table are CMS Energy&#8217;s basic and diluted EPS computations based on income from continuing operations: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Income available to common stockholders Income from continuing operations $ 809 &#160; $ 728 &#160; $ 694 &#160; Less loss attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 24 ) ( 23 ) ( 3 ) Less preferred stock dividends 10 &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Income from continuing operations available to common stockholders &#8211; basic and diluted $ 823 &#160; $ 746 &#160; $ 697 &#160; Average common shares outstanding Weighted-average shares &#8211; basic 289.5 &#160; 289.0 &#160; 285.0 &#160; Add dilutive nonvested stock awards 0.3 &#160; 0.5 &#160; 0.7 &#160; Add dilutive forward equity sale contracts 0.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.6 &#160; Weighted-average shares &#8211; diluted 290.0 &#160; 289.5 &#160; 286.3 &#160; Income from continuing operations per average common share available to common stockholders Basic $ 2.84 &#160; $ 2.58 &#160; $ 2.45 &#160; Diluted 2.84 &#160; 2.58 &#160; 2.44 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNonvested Stock Awards \n\nCMS Energy&#8217;s nonvested stock awards are composed of participating and non&#8209;participating securities. The participating securities accrue cash dividends when common stockholders receive dividends. Since the recipient is not required to return the dividends to CMS Energy if the recipient forfeits the award, the nonvested stock awards are considered participating securities. As such, the participating nonvested stock awards were included in the computation of basic EPS. The non&#8209;participating securities accrue stock dividends that vest concurrently with the stock award. If the recipient forfeits the award, the stock dividends accrued on the non&#8209;participating securities are also forfeited. Accordingly, the non&#8209;participating awards and stock dividends were included in the computation of diluted EPS, but not in the computation of basic EPS. \n\nForward Equity Sale Contracts \n\nCMS Energy has entered into forward equity sale contracts. These forward equity sale contracts are non&#8209;participating securities. While the forward sale price in the forward equity sale contract is decreased on certain dates by certain predetermined amounts to reflect expected dividend payments, these price \n\nTable of Contents \n\nadjustments were set upon inception of the agreement and the forward contract does not give the owner the right to participate in undistributed earnings. Accordingly, the forward equity sale contracts were included in the computation of diluted EPS, but not in the computation of basic EPS. For further details on the forward equity sale contracts, see Note 4, Financings and Capitalization. \n\n14: Revenue \n\nPresented in the following tables are the components of operating revenue: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Year Ended December 31, 2022 Electric Utility Gas Utility NorthStar Clean Energy 1 \n\nConsolidated CMS Energy, including Consumers Consumers utility revenue $ 5,395 &#160; $ 2,720 &#160; $ &#8212; $ 8,115 &#160; Other &#8212; &#8212; 205 &#160; 205 &#160; Revenue recognized from contracts with customers $ 5,395 &#160; $ 2,720 &#160; $ 205 &#160; $ 8,320 &#160; Leasing income &#8212; &#8212; 240 &#160; 240 &#160; Financing income 10 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; 16 &#160; Consumers alternative-revenue programs 43 &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; 57 &#160; Consumers revenues to be refunded ( 29 ) ( 8 ) &#8212; ( 37 ) Total operating revenue &#8211; CMS Energy $ 5,419 &#160; $ 2,732 &#160; $ 445 &#160; $ 8,596 &#160; Consumers Consumers utility revenue Residential $ 2,523 &#160; $ 1,879 &#160; $ 4,402 &#160; Commercial 1,733 &#160; 559 &#160; 2,292 &#160; Industrial 792 &#160; 75 &#160; 867 &#160; Other 347 &#160; 207 &#160; 554 &#160; Revenue recognized from contracts with customers $ 5,395 &#160; $ 2,720 &#160; $ 8,115 &#160; Financing income 10 &#160; 6 &#160; 16 &#160; Alternative-revenue programs 43 &#160; 14 &#160; 57 &#160; Revenues to be refunded ( 29 ) ( 8 ) ( 37 ) Total operating revenue &#8211; Consumers $ 5,419 &#160; $ 2,732 &#160; $ 8,151 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Amounts represent NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s operating revenue from independent power production and its sales of energy commodities. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Year Ended December 31, 2021 Electric Utility Gas Utility NorthStar Clean Energy 1 \n\nConsolidated CMS Energy, including Consumers Consumers utility revenue $ 4,915 &#160; $ 2,046 &#160; $ &#8212; $ 6,961 &#160; Other &#8212; &#8212; 114 &#160; 114 &#160; Revenue recognized from contracts with customers $ 4,915 &#160; $ 2,046 &#160; $ 114 &#160; $ 7,075 &#160; Leasing income &#8212; &#8212; 194 &#160; 194 &#160; Financing income 10 &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; 15 &#160; Consumers alternative-revenue programs 33 &#160; 12 &#160; &#8212; 45 &#160; Total operating revenue &#8211; CMS Energy $ 4,958 &#160; $ 2,063 &#160; $ 308 &#160; $ 7,329 &#160; Consumers Consumers utility revenue Residential $ 2,402 &#160; $ 1,396 &#160; $ 3,798 &#160; Commercial 1,573 &#160; 396 &#160; 1,969 &#160; Industrial 624 &#160; 54 &#160; 678 &#160; Other 316 &#160; 200 &#160; 516 &#160; Revenue recognized from contracts with customers $ 4,915 &#160; $ 2,046 &#160; $ 6,961 &#160; Financing income 10 &#160; 5 &#160; 15 &#160; Alternative-revenue programs 33 &#160; 12 &#160; 45 &#160; Total operating revenue &#8211; Consumers $ 4,958 &#160; $ 2,063 &#160; $ 7,021 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Amounts represent NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s operating revenue from independent power production and its sales of energy commodities. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Year Ended December 31, 2020 Electric Utility Gas Utility NorthStar Clean Energy 1 \n\nConsolidated CMS Energy, including Consumers Consumers utility revenue $ 4,348 &#160; $ 1,809 &#160; $ &#8212; $ 6,157 &#160; Other &#8212; &#8212; 81 &#160; 81 &#160; Revenue recognized from contracts with customers $ 4,348 &#160; $ 1,809 &#160; $ 81 &#160; $ 6,238 &#160; Leasing income &#8212; &#8212; 148 &#160; 148 &#160; Financing income 11 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; 17 &#160; Consumers alternative-revenue programs 29 &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; 43 &#160; Consumers revenues to be refunded ( 16 ) ( 12 ) &#8212; ( 28 ) Total operating revenue &#8211; CMS Energy $ 4,372 &#160; $ 1,817 &#160; $ 229 &#160; $ 6,418 &#160; Consumers Consumers utility revenue Residential $ 2,109 &#160; $ 1,232 &#160; $ 3,341 &#160; Commercial 1,444 &#160; 337 &#160; 1,781 &#160; Industrial 570 &#160; 46 &#160; 616 &#160; Other 225 &#160; 194 &#160; 419 &#160; Revenue recognized from contracts with customers $ 4,348 &#160; $ 1,809 &#160; $ 6,157 &#160; Financing income 11 &#160; 6 &#160; 17 &#160; Alternative-revenue programs 29 &#160; 14 &#160; 43 &#160; Revenues to be refunded ( 16 ) ( 12 ) ( 28 ) Total operating revenue &#8211; Consumers $ 4,372 &#160; $ 1,817 &#160; $ 6,189 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Amounts represent NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s operating revenue from independent power production and its sales of energy commodities. \n\nElectric and Gas Utilities \n\nConsumers Utility Revenue: Consumers recognizes revenue primarily from the sale of electric and gas utility services at tariff-based rates regulated by the MPSC. Consumers&#8217; customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. Consumers&#8217; tariff-based sales performance obligations are described below. \n\n&#8226; Consumers has performance obligations for the service of standing ready to deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, and it satisfies these performance obligations over time. Consumers recognizes revenue at a fixed rate as it provides these services. These arrangements generally do not have fixed terms and remain in effect as long as the customer consumes the utility service. The rates are set by the MPSC through the rate-making process and represent the stand-alone selling price of Consumers&#8217; service to stand ready to deliver. \n\n&#8226; Consumers has performance obligations for the service of delivering the commodity of electricity or natural gas to customers, and it satisfies these performance obligations upon delivery. Consumers recognizes revenue at a price per unit of electricity or natural gas delivered, based on the tariffs established by the MPSC. These arrangements generally do not have fixed terms and remain in effect as long as the customer consumes the utility service. The rates are set by the MPSC through the rate-making process and represent the stand-alone selling price of a bundled \n\nTable of Contents \n\nproduct comprising the commodity, electricity or natural gas, and the service of delivering such commodity. \n\nIn some instances, Consumers has specific fixed-term contracts with large commercial and industrial customers to provide electricity or gas at certain tariff rates or to provide gas transportation services at contracted rates. The amount of electricity and gas to be delivered under these contracts and the associated future revenue to be received are generally dependent on the customers&#8217; needs. Accordingly, Consumers recognizes revenues at the tariff or contracted rate as electricity or gas is delivered to the customer. Consumers also has other miscellaneous contracts with customers related to pole and other property rentals, appliance service plans, and utility contract work. Generally, these contracts are short term or evergreen in nature. \n\nAccounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues: Accounts receivable comprise trade receivables and unbilled receivables. CMS Energy and Consumers record their accounts receivable at cost less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. The allowance is increased for uncollectible accounts expense and decreased for account write-offs net of recoveries. CMS Energy and Consumers establish the allowance based on historical losses, management&#8217;s assessment of existing economic conditions, customer payment trends, and reasonable and supported forecast information. CMS Energy and Consumers assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms established with customers. Accounts are written off when deemed uncollectible, which is generally when they become six months past due. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, CMS Energy and Consumers recorded uncollectible accounts expense of $ 50 million, which included a commitment to contribute $ 10 million to directly assist vulnerable customers with utility bills. CMS Energy and Consumers recorded uncollectible accounts expense of $ 22 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $ 33 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\nConsumers&#8217; customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or natural gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. Unbilled revenues, which are recorded as accounts receivable and accrued revenue on CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; consolidated balance sheets, were $ 663 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 486 million at December 31, 2021. \n\nAlternative &#8209; Revenue Programs: Consumers accounts for its energy waste reduction incentive mechanism and financial compensation mechanism as alternative-revenue programs. Consumers recognizes revenue related to the energy waste reduction incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC and recognizes revenue related to the financial compensation mechanism as payments are made on MPSC-approved PPAs. For additional information on these mechanisms, see Note 2, Regulatory Matters. \n\nUnder a gas revenue decoupling mechanism authorized by the MPSC, Consumers is allowed to adjust future gas rates for differences between Consumers&#8217; actual weather&#8209;normalized, non&#8209;fuel revenues and the revenues approved by the MPSC. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative&#8209;revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing the effects of decoupling adjustments on revenue as gas is delivered. \n\nConsumers does not reclassify revenue from its alternative-revenue program to revenue from contracts with customers at the time the amounts are collected from customers. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRevenues to Be Refunded: In 2020, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to refund $ 28 million voluntarily to utility customers. This amount was refunded to customers during 2021 and 2022 in the form of incremental spending above amounts included in rates on various programs. \n\nIn December 2022, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to refund $ 22 million voluntarily to utility customers. Additionally, in the settlement of its 2022 electric rate case, Consumers agreed to refund voluntarily $ 15 million of 2022 revenues to utility customers through a one-time bill credit. For additional information, see Note 2, Regulatory Matters . \n\n15: Other Income and Other Expense \n\nPresented in the following table are the components of other income and other expense at CMS Energy and Consumers: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 CMS Energy, including Consumers Other income Interest income $ 5 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 4 &#160; Interest income - related parties &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; Allowance for equity funds used during construction 6 &#160; 8 &#160; 6 &#160; Income from equity method investees 3 &#160; 10 &#160; 5 &#160; All other 5 &#160; 9 &#160; 6 &#160; Total other income &#8211; CMS Energy $ 19 &#160; $ 30 &#160; $ 28 &#160; Consumers Other income Interest income $ 2 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 3 &#160; Interest income - related parties 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; Allowance for equity funds used during construction 6 &#160; 8 &#160; 6 &#160; All other 4 &#160; 8 &#160; 5 &#160; Total other income &#8211; Consumers $ 17 &#160; $ 23 &#160; $ 19 &#160; CMS Energy, including Consumers Other expense Donations $ ( 9 ) $ ( 6 ) $ ( 35 ) Civic and political expenditures ( 6 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Loss on reacquired and extinguished debt &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 16 ) All other ( 12 ) ( 7 ) ( 6 ) Total other expense &#8211; CMS Energy $ ( 27 ) $ ( 18 ) $ ( 62 ) Consumers Other expense Donations $ ( 9 ) $ ( 6 ) $ ( 33 ) Civic and political expenditures ( 6 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) All other ( 10 ) ( 7 ) ( 5 ) Total other expense &#8211; Consumers $ ( 25 ) $ ( 18 ) $ ( 43 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n16: Reportable Segments \n\nReportable segments consist of business units defined by the products and services they offer. CMS Energy and Consumers evaluate the performance of each segment based on its contribution to net income available to CMS Energy&#8217;s common stockholders. \n\nAccounting policies for CMS Energy&#8217;s and Consumers&#8217; segments are as described in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the individual segments when appropriate. Accounts are allocated among the segments when common accounts are attributable to more than one segment. The allocations are based on certain measures of business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers, other operating and maintenance expense, construction expense, leased property, taxes, or functional surveys. For example, customer receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated based on labor dollars. \n\nInter-segment sales and transfers are accounted for at current market prices and are eliminated in consolidated net income available to common stockholders by segment. Inter-segment sales and transfers were immaterial for all periods presented. \n\nCMS Energy \n\nThe segments reported for CMS Energy are: \n\n&#8226; electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity in Michigan \n\n&#8226; gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas in Michigan \n\n&#8226; NorthStar Clean Energy (formerly known as the enterprises segment), consisting of various subsidiaries engaging in domestic independent power production, including the development and operation of renewable generation, and the marketing of independent power production \n\nIn August 2022, CMS Enterprises Company changed its legal name to NorthStar Clean Energy Company. To align the segment reporting with the legal organizational structure and the internal reporting of CMS Energy, the enterprises segment will now be referred to as NorthStar Clean Energy. There were no changes to CMS Energy&#8217;s reportable segment composition as a result of this name change. \n\nIn October 2021, EnerBank was acquired by Regions Bank. As a result, EnerBank was removed from the composition of CMS Energy&#8217;s reportable segments. EnerBank&#8217;s results of operations through the date of the sale are presented as income from discontinued operations on CMS Energy&#8217;s consolidated statements of income. For information regarding the sale of EnerBank, see Note 19, Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations. \n\nCMS Energy presents corporate interest and other expenses, discontinued operations, and Consumers&#8217;

The demand note bears interest at an annual rate of 4.10 percent and has a maturity date of 2028. The portion of the demand note attributable to Consumers was recorded as a note receivable &#8211; related party on Consumers&#8217; consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nConsumers has a natural gas transportation agreement with a subsidiary of CMS Energy that extends through 2038, related to a pipeline owned by Consumers. For additional details about the agreement, see Note 8, Leases. \n\nIn June 2021, Consumers entered into an agreement with DIG, CMS Generation Michigan Power, and CMS ERM to purchase NorthStar Clean Energy&#8217;s three natural gas-fueled generating units for $ 515 million, subject to certain adjustments. Consumers had proposed purchasing these generating units as part of its 2021 IRP. However, in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement of its 2021 IRP, which was approved by the MPSC in June 2022, Consumers will not purchase these generating units. \n\nIn December 2022, Consumers renewed a short-term credit agreement with CMS Energy, permitting Consumers to borrow up to $ 500 million. For additional details about the agreement, see Note 4, Financings and Capitalization . \n\nTable of Contents \n\n18: Variable Interest Entities \n\nIn June 2022, NorthStar Clean Energy sold a Class A membership interest in NWO Holdco to a tax equity investor for $ 49 million. NWO Holdco owns 100 percent of Northwest Ohio Wind, LLC, a 100 &#8209;MW wind generation project in Paulding County, Ohio. NorthStar Clean Energy retained a Class B membership interest in NWO Holdco. \n\nNorthStar Clean Energy has a 51 &#8209;percent ownership interest in Aviator Wind Equity Holdings, which holds a Class B membership interest in Aviator Wind, the holding company of a 525 &#8209;MW wind generation project in Coke County, Texas. The Class A membership interest in Aviator Wind is held by a tax equity investor. \n\nEarnings, tax attributes, and cash flows generated by NWO Holdco and Aviator Wind are allocated among and distributed to the membership classes in accordance with the ratios specified in the associated limited liability company agreements; these ratios change over time and are not representative of the ownership interest percentages of each membership class. Since NWO Holdco&#8217;s and Aviator Wind&#8217;s income and cash flows are not distributed among their investors based on ownership interest percentages, NorthStar Clean Energy allocates the entities&#8217; income (loss) among the investors by applying the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. This method calculates each investor&#8217;s earnings based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entities at the net book value of underlying assets as of the balance sheet date. The liquidation tax gain (loss) is allocated to each investor&#8217;s capital account, resulting in income (loss) equal to the period change in the investor&#8217;s capital account balance. \n\nNWO Holdco, Aviator Wind Equity Holdings, and Aviator Wind are VIEs. In accordance with the associated limited liability company agreements, the tax equity investors are guaranteed preferred returns from NWO Holdco and Aviator Wind. However, NorthStar Clean Energy manages and controls the operating activities of NWO Holdco and Aviator Wind Equity Holdings (and, thereby, Aviator Wind). As a result, NorthStar Clean Energy is the primary beneficiary, as it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the companies, as well as the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the companies. NorthStar Clean Energy consolidates NWO Holdco, Aviator Wind Equity Holdings, and Aviator Wind and presents the Class A membership interests and 49 percent of the Class B membership interest in Aviator Wind as noncontrolling interests. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table are the carrying values of the VIEs&#8217; assets and liabilities included on CMS Energy&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions December 31 2022 2021 Current Cash and cash equivalents $ 28 &#160; $ 21 &#160; Restricted cash and cash equivalents &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Accounts receivable 7 &#160; 3 &#160; Prepayments and other current assets 3 &#160; 2 &#160; Non-current Plant, property, and equipment, net 825 &#160; 856 &#160; Total assets 1 \n\n$ 863 &#160; $ 883 &#160; Current Accounts payable $ 15 &#160; $ 17 &#160; Other current liabilities &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; Non-current Asset retirement obligations 24 &#160; 23 &#160; Other non-current liabilities &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Total liabilities $ 39 &#160; $ 46 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Assets may be used only to meet VIEs&#8217; obligations and commitments. \n\nNorthStar Clean Energy is obligated under certain indemnities that protect the tax equity investors against losses incurred as a result of breaches of representations and warranties under the associated limited liability company agreements. For additional details on these indemnity obligations, see Note 3, Contingencies and Commitments&#8212;Guarantees. \n\nOther VIEs: CMS Energy has variable interests in T.E.S. Filer City, Grayling, Genesee, and Craven. While CMS Energy owns 50 percent of each partnership, it is not the primary beneficiary of any of these partnerships because decision making is shared among unrelated parties, and no one party has the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; economic performance, such as operations and maintenance, plant dispatch, and fuel strategy. The partners must agree on all major decisions for each of the partnerships. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPresented in the following table is information about these partnerships: \n\n##TABLE_START Name Nature of the Entity Nature of CMS Energy&#8217;s Involvement T.E.S. Filer City Coal-fueled power generator Long-term PPA between partnership and Consumers Employee assignment agreement Grayling Wood waste-fueled power generator Long-term PPA between partnership and Consumers Reduced dispatch agreement with Consumers 1 \n\nOperating and management contract Genesee Wood waste-fueled power generator Long-term PPA between partnership and Consumers Reduced dispatch agreement with Consumers 1 \n\nOperating and management contract Craven Wood waste-fueled power generator Operating and management contract ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Reduced dispatch agreements allow the facilities to be dispatched based on the market price of power compared with the cost of production of the plants. This results in fuel cost savings that each partnership shares with Consumers&#8217; customers. \n\nThe creditors of these partnerships do not have recourse to the general credit of CMS Energy or Consumers. CMS Energy&#8217;s maximum risk exposure to these partnerships is generally limited to its investment in the partnerships, which is included in investments on its consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $ 71 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n19: Exit Activities and Discontinued Operations \n\nExit Activities: Under its Clean Energy Plan, Consumers will retire the D.E. Karn coal-fueled electric generating units in 2023. In 2019, Consumers announced a retention incentive program to ensure necessary staffing at the D.E. Karn generating complex through the anticipated retirement of the coal-fueled generating units. Based on the number of employees that have chosen to participate, the aggregate cost of the program through 2023 is estimated to be $ 35 million. In its order in Consumers&#8217; 2020 electric rate case, the MPSC approved deferred accounting treatment for these costs; Consumers began deferring these costs as a regulatory asset in 2021. \n\nUnder the 2021 IRP, Consumers will retire the J.H. Campbell coal-fueled generating units in 2025. Similar to the D.E. Karn program, Consumers is providing a retention incentive program to ensure necessary staffing at the J.H. Campbell generating complex through retirement. Based on the number of employees that have chosen to participate, the aggregate cost of the program through 2025 is estimated to be $ 50 million. Additionally, Consumers recognized $ 4 million related to severance benefits during the year ended December 31, 2022. This amount was recorded in other non-current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022. The 2021 IRP provides deferred accounting treatment for the retention and severance costs recognized during 2022; deferral of costs beyond 2022 was approved as part of the 2022 electric rate case settlement. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the cumulative cost incurred and charged to expense related to the D.E. Karn retention incentive program was $ 16 million. Additionally, an amount of $ 4 million has been capitalized as a cost of plant, property, and equipment and an amount of $ 11 million has been deferred as a regulatory asset. The cumulative cost incurred and deferred as a regulatory asset related to the J.H. Campbell retention incentive program was $ 20 million. \n\nPresented in the following table is a reconciliation of the retention benefit liability recorded in other liabilities on Consumers&#8217; consolidated balance sheets: \n\n##TABLE_START In Millions Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 Retention benefit liability at beginning of period $ 14 &#160; $ 11 &#160; Costs deferred as a regulatory asset \n\n24 &#160; 7 &#160; Costs incurred and capitalized &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Costs paid or settled ( 17 ) ( 5 ) Retention benefit liability at the end of the period 1 \n\n$ 21 &#160; $ 14 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Includes current portion of other liabilities of $ 13 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 5 million at December 31, 2021. \n\nDiscontinued Operations: In October 2021, EnerBank was acquired by Regions Bank. CMS Energy received proceeds of over $ 1.0 billion from the transaction and recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 657 million in 2021. In March 2022, CMS Energy received $ 6 million of additional proceeds as the result of a post-closing adjustment. Net of related transaction costs, CMS Energy recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 5 million during 2022. \n\nIn December 2021, CMS Energy submitted a notice of disagreement to Regions Bank relating to a $ 36 million negative post-closing purchase price adjustment that it believed was inconsistent with the merger agreement. In accordance with the merger agreement, the disputed adjustment was submitted to a mutually agreed upon independent accounting firm for final determination. In June 2022, the accounting firm rendered a determination on the disputed items entirely in favor of CMS Energy. As a result, no further adjustment was required in 2022. \n\nEnerBank&#8217;s results of operations through the date of the sale are presented as income from discontinued operations on CMS Energy&#8217;s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.

We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAccounting for the Effects of New Regulatory Matters \n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a utility and must apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under regulatory accounting, the Company records regulatory assets or liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as expense or revenue by a non - regulated business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recognized a total of $ 3,652 million of regulatory assets, $ 3,900 million of regulatory liabilities, and $ 409 million of accrued revenue. As described by management, there are multiple participants to rate case proceedings who often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of the Company&#8217;s policies and practices. These participants often seek cost disallowances and other relief and have appealed significant decisions reached by the regulators. The recovery of regulatory assets and the settlement of regulatory liabilities are contingent upon the outcomes of rate cases and regulatory proceedings. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to management&#8217;s accounting for the effects of new regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity applied to evaluate management&#8217;s assessment of the potential outcomes and related accounting impacts associated with pending rate case proceedings, (ii) in some cases, the significant audit effort necessary to assess contrary evidence from various parties involved in rate case proceedings, and (iii) the significant audit effort necessary to evaluate audit evidence related to the recovery of regulatory assets and the settlement of regulatory liabilities. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s assessment of regulatory proceedings, including the probability of recovering incurred costs and the related accounting and disclosure impacts. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the Company&#8217;s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s assessment regarding whether recovery of regulatory assets and settlement of regulatory liabilities is probable and evaluating the sufficiency of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Procedures were performed to evaluate the regulatory assets and liabilities, including those subject to pending rate cases, based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, or application of relevant regulatory precedents. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nDetroit, Michigan \n\nFebruary 9, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2007. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n(This page intentionally left blank) \n\nTable of Contents \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholder of Consumers Energy Company \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumers Energy Company and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;).

Controls and Procedures \n\nCMS Energy \n\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMS Energy&#8217;s CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: CMS Energy&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). CMS Energy&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that: \n\n&#8226; pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of CMS Energy \n\n&#8226; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMS Energy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of CMS Energy \n\n&#8226; provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of CMS Energy&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements \n\nManagement, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates. \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMS Energy conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
