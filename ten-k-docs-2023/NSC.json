Properties \n\n&#160; \n\nGENERAL &#8211; Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based company that owns a major freight railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR). We were incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Our common stock (Common Stock) is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol &#8220;NSC.&#8221; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnless indicated otherwise, Norfolk Southern Corporation and its subsidiaries, including NSR, are referred to collectively as NS, we, us, and our. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are primarily engaged in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods primarily in the Southeast, East, and Midwest and, via interchange with rail carriers, to and from the rest of the United States (U.S.). We also transport overseas freight through several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports. We offer the most extensive intermodal network in the eastern half of the U.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe make available free of charge through our website, www.norfolksouthern.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, the following documents are available on our website and in print to any shareholder who requests them: \n\n&#8226; Norfolk Southern Corporation Bylaws \n\n&#8226; Charters of the Committees of the Board of Directors \n\n&#8226; Corporate Governance Guidelines \n\n&#8226; Categorical Independence Standards \n\n&#8226; The Thoroughbred Code of Ethics \n\n&#8226; Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Financial Officers \n\nK3 \n\nRAILROAD OPERATIONS &#8211; At December 31, 2022, we operated approximately 19,100 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur system reaches many manufacturing plants, electric generating facilities, mines, distribution centers, transload facilities, and other businesses located in our service area. \n\nCorridors with heaviest freight volume: \n\n&#8226; New York City area to Chicago (via Allentown and Pittsburgh) \n\n&#8226; Chicago to Macon (via Cincinnati, Chattanooga, and Atlanta) \n\n&#8226; Central Ohio to Norfolk (via Columbus and Roanoke) \n\n&#8226; Birmingham to Meridian \n\n&#8226; Cleveland to Kansas City \n\n&#8226; Memphis to Chattanooga \n\nK4 \n\nThe miles operated, which include major leased lines between Cincinnati and Chattanooga, and an exclusive operating agreement for trackage rights over property owned by North Carolina Railroad Company, were as follows: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; Mileage Operated at December 31, 2022 Route Miles Second and Other Main Track Passing Track, Crossovers and Turnouts Way and \n\nYard \n\nSwitching &#160; \n\nTotal Owned 14,312 2,676 1,957 8,158 27,103 Operated under lease, contract or trackage rights 4,825 1,889 406 841 7,961 Total 19,137 4,565 2,363 8,999 35,064 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nWe operate freight service over lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations and conduct freight operations over trackage owned or leased by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, Maryland Department of Transportation, and Michigan Department of Transportation. \n\nThe following table sets forth certain statistics relating to our operations for the past five years: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; Years ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Revenue ton miles (billions) 179 178 164 194 207 Revenue per thousand revenue ton miles $ 71.35 $ 62.56 $ 59.67 $ 58.21 $ 55.25 Revenue ton miles (thousands) per railroad employee 9,513 9,694 8,191 7,939 7,822 Ratio of railway operating expenses to railway operating revenues (railway operating ratio) 62.3% 60.1% 69.3% 64.7% 65.4% ##TABLE_END\n\nRAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES &#8211; Total railway operating revenues were $12.7 billion in 2022. Following is an overview of our three commodity groups. See the discussion of merchandise revenues by major commodity group, intermodal revenues, and coal revenues and tonnage in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; \n\n&#160; \n\nMERCHANDISE &#8211; Our merchandise commodity group is composed of four groupings: \n\n&#8226; Agriculture, forest and consumer products includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, livestock and poultry feed, food products, food oils, flour, sweeteners, ethanol, lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, beverages, and canned goods. \n\n&#8226; Chemicals includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products (including crude oil), chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, sand, and natural gas liquids. \n\n&#8226; Metals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, minerals, clay, transportation equipment, and items for the U.S. military. \n\n&#8226; Automotive includes finished motor vehicles and automotive parts. \n\nIn 2022, we handled 2.2 million merchandise carloads, which accounted for 57% of our total railway operating revenues. \n\nK5 \n\nINTERMODAL &#8211; Our intermodal commodity group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers. These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, premium customers and asset-owning companies. In 2022, we handled 3.9 million intermodal units, which accounted for 29% of our total railway operating revenues. \n\n&#160; \n\nCOAL &#8211; Coal revenues accounted for 14% of our total railway operating revenues in 2022. We handled 77 million tons, or 0.7 million carloads, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins, with the balance from major western coal basins received via the Memphis and Chicago gateways. Our coal franchise supports the electric generation market, directly serving approximately 30 coal-fired power plants, as well as the export, domestic metallurgical and industrial markets, primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River, at Lamberts Point in Norfolk, Virginia, at the Port of Baltimore, and on Lake Erie. \n\nFREIGHT RATES &#8211; Our predominant pricing mechanisms, private contracts and exempt price quotes, are not subject to regulation. In general, market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices. \n\n&#160; \n\nRAILWAY PROPERTY \n\n&#160; \n\nOur railroad infrastructure makes us capital intensive with net properties of approximately $32 billion on a historical cost basis. \n\nProperty Additions &#8211; Property additions for the past five years were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 &#160; ($ in millions) Road and other property $ 1,345 $ 1,041 $ 1,046 $ 1,371 $ 1,276 Equipment 603 429 448 648 675 Total $ 1,948 $ 1,470 $ 1,494 $ 2,019 $ 1,951 ##TABLE_END\n\nOur capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient, and reliable rail transportation services. \n\nK6 \n\nEquipment &#8211; At December 31, 2022, we owned or leased the following units of equipment: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START Owned Leased Total Capacity of Equipment Locomotives: &#160; &#160; &#160; (Horsepower) Multiple purpose 3,046 &#8212; 3,046 11,845,600 Auxiliary units 140 &#8212; 140 &#8212; Switching 4 &#8212; 4 4,400 Total locomotives 3,190 &#8212; 3,190 11,850,000 Freight cars: &#160; &#160; &#160; (Tons) Gondola 17,391 2,836 20,227 2,265,085 Hopper 7,818 &#8212; 7,818 892,800 Covered hopper 5,571 &#8212; 5,571 619,424 Box 2,530 703 3,233 295,536 Flat 1,390 676 2,066 152,719 Other 1,555 &#8212; 1,555 69,649 Total freight cars 36,255 4,215 40,470 4,295,213 Other: Chassis 35,393 1,100 36,493 Containers 18,047 &#8212; 18,047 Work equipment 5,408 243 5,651 Vehicles 2,976 14 2,990 Miscellaneous 2,243 &#8212; 2,243 Total other 64,067 1,357 65,424 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at December 31, 2022: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2013- 2017 2008- 2012 2007 &#38; Before Total Locomotives: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; No. of units &#8212; 1 10 36 15 260 231 2,637 3,190 % of fleet &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 1 % 1 % 8 % 7 % 83 % 100 % Freight cars: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; No. of units 236 &#8212; &#8212; 200 &#8212; 4,202 8,843 22,774 36,255 % of fleet 1 % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 12 % 24 % 63 % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nK7 \n\nThe following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at December 31, 2022 and information regarding 2022 retirements: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; Locomotives &#160; Freight Cars Average age &#8211; in service 27.6 years 25.9 years Retirements 22 units 1,209 units Average age &#8211; retired 25.2 years 45.5 years ##TABLE_END\n\nTrack Maintenance &#8211; Of the 35,100 total miles of track on which we operate, we are responsible for maintaining 28,400 miles, with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance. \n\nOver 85% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard. Approximately 40% of our lines, excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2022. \n\nThe following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years: ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Track miles of rail installed 541 458 418 449 416 Miles of track surfaced 4,155 4,225 4,785 5,012 4,594 Crossties installed (millions) 2.2 2.0 1.8 2.4 2.2 ##TABLE_END\n\nTraffic Control &#8211; Of the 16,200 route miles we dispatch, 11,300 miles are signalized, including 8,500 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,800 miles of automatic block signals. Of the 8,500 miles of CTC, 7,600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites. \n\n&#160; \n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS &#8211; Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one of our principal goals. To date, such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or competitive position. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \n\nWorkforce &#8211; We employed an average of 18,900 employees during 2022, and 19,300 employees at the end of 2022. Approximately 80% of our railroad employees &#8211; referred to as &#8220;craft&#8221; employees &#8211; are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. See the discussion of &#8220;Labor Agreements&#8221; in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; The remainder of our workforce is composed of management employees. \n\n&#160; \n\nCraft Workforce Levels and Productivity &#8211; Maintaining appropriate headcount levels for our craft-employee workforce is critical to our on-time and consistent delivery of customers&#8217; goods and operational efficiency goals. We manage this human capital metric through forecasting tools designed to ensure the optimal level of staffing to meet business demands. We measure and monitor employee productivity based on various factors, including gross ton miles per train and engine employee. \n\nSafety &#8211; We are dedicated to providing employees with a safe workplace and the knowledge and tools they need to work safely and return home safely every day. Our commitment to an injury-free workplace is outlined in our Foundation of Safety policy which focuses on rules compliance, responsibility, relationships, and responsiveness. Our safety programs, practices, and messaging further reinforces the importance of working safely. We measure \n\nK8 \n\nemployee safety performance through internal metrics such as accidents, injuries, and serious injuries per 200,000 employee-hours. We also use metrics established by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to measure FRA reportable accidents and injuries per 200,000 employee-hours. Given the importance of safety among our workforce and business, in 2020, our Board of Directors established a standing Safety Committee that, among other duties, reviews, monitors, and evaluates our compliance with our safety programs and practices. \n\nAttracting and Retaining Management Employees &#8211; Our talent strategy for management employees is essential to attracting strong candidates in a competitive talent environment. We evaluate the effectiveness of that strategy by studying market trends, benchmarking the attractiveness of our employee value proposition, maintaining a competitive compensation package, and analyzing retention data. \n\nWe also focus on driving employee engagement, which is key to increasing employee productivity, retention, and safety. We take a data-centric approach, including the use of quarterly surveys among management employees, to identify new initiatives that will help boost engagement and drive business results. \n\nEmployee Development and Training &#8211; We provide a range of developmental programs, opportunities, skills, and resources for our employees to be successful in their careers. We provide classroom instruction, hands-on training and simulation-based training designed to improve training effectiveness and safety outcomes. \n\nWe also use modern learning and performance technologies to offer robust professional growth opportunities. Through on-demand digital course offerings, custom-built learning paths, and performance-management tools, our platforms deliver a contemporary, convenient, and inclusive approach to professional development. \n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion &#8211; As a leading transportation service company, we understand that competing in the global marketplace requires recruiting the most qualified, talented, and diverse people. We strive to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace where a wide range of perspectives and experiences are represented, valued, and empowered to thrive. \n\nWhile our current workforce reflects a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, we continue to focus on building an even more diverse workforce, using technology-driven outreach and multiple recruiting relationships to maintain a robust pipeline of diverse talent. \n\nTo underscore our commitment to cultivating a workplace experience where the unique experiences, perspectives, and contributions of all our people are valued, our CEO recently signed the CEO Action for Diversity &#38; Inclusion pledge, which outlines specific actions to create a welcoming environment for discussions and ideas about diversity and inclusion. To advance that commitment, senior leaders from across the company serve on an Inclusion Leadership Council, which partners with the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategy team in implementing our enterprise inclusion strategy, articulating measurable goals, and holding ourselves accountable. \n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION &#8211; In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, our railroads are subject to regulation by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB). The STB has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. The STB has jurisdiction to determine whether we are &#8220;revenue adequate&#8221; on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year. A railroad is &#8220;revenue adequate&#8221; on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry&#8217;s composite cost of capital. This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement. The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing. Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract. Approximately 90% \n\nK9 \n\nof our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates. \n\n&#160; \n\nEfforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry, and such efforts are expected to continue in 2023. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers, and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry. Accordingly, we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation. \n\nRailroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by Congress and regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) (including the Federal Railroad Administration) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)), which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety, security and cybersecurity. \n\nGovernment regulations are further discussed within Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the &#8220;Security of Operations&#8221; section contained herein. \n\n&#160; \n\nCOMPETITION &#8211; There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers. Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products. Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages. \n\nOur primary rail competitor is CSX Corporation (CSX); both we and CSX operate throughout much of the same territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory. We also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products. \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets. \n\nSECURITY OF OPERATIONS &#8211; We continue to enhance the security of our rail system. Our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001. The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry to mitigate the risk of terrorist, violent extremist or seriously disruptive cyber-attack increases or decreases. The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas: (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police. All of our Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change. \n\nOur security plan also complies with DOT security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials. As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and is integrated into hazardous material training programs. Additionally, location-specific security plans are in place for rail corridors in certain metropolitan areas referred to as High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in a HTUA by: (1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local, and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest. \n\nK10 \n\nWe also operate four facilities that are under U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Maritime Security Regulations. With respect to these facilities, each facility&#8217;s security plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and remains subject to inspection by the USCG. \n\nAdditionally, we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the DHS, the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FRA, the USCG, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Defense, and various state Homeland Security offices. \n\nIn 2022, through the Norfolk Southern Operation Awareness and Response Program as well as participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response Program, we provided rail accident response training to approximately 5,000 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel, utilizing a combination of online training and face-to-face training sessions as well as the Norfolk Southern Safety Train. We also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Center. \n\nWe also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning, with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks. Our risk-based information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks, to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives, and to keep us in the best position to detect, mitigate, and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The information set forth in this Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report, including \n\nItem 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nREGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE RISKS \n\nGovernmental legislation, regulation, and Executive Orders over commercial, operational, tax, safety, security, or cybersecurity matters could negatively affect us, our customers, the rail industry or the markets we serve. Congress can enact laws, agencies can promulgate regulations, and Executive Orders can be issued that increase or alter regulation that negatively affects us, our customers, the rail industry or the markets we serve. Railroads presently are subject to commercial and operational regulation by the STB, which has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. \n\nThe STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. Additional or updated regulation of the rail industry by Congress or the STB, whether under new, existing or amended laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services, on our railway operating revenues, and on the efficiency, conduct, or complexity of our operations. Such additional or updated industry regulation, as well as enactment of any new or updated tax laws, could also negatively impact cash flows from our operating activities and, therefore, result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines. \n\nRailroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by Congress and regulation by the DOT (including the FRA) and the DHS (including the TSA), which regulate many aspects of our operations related to safety, security and cybersecurity. Additional or updated safety, security, or cybersecurity regulation by Congress, the DOT or DHS could have a negative impact on our business and the efficiency, conduct, or complexity of our operations including (but not limited to) increased operating costs, capital expenditures, claims and litigation. \n\nK11 \n\nOur inability to comply with the requirements of existing or updated laws, regulations, or Executive Orders that govern our operations or the rail industry, including but not limited to those pertaining to commercial, operational, tax, safety, security, or cybersecurity matters, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nFederal and state environmental laws and regulations could negatively impact us and our operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things: emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and, the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. The risk of incurring environmental liability, for acts and omissions, past, present, and future, is inherent in the railroad business. This risk includes property owned by us, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants. \n\nEnvironmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. \n\nOur inability to comply with the extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in significant liabilities or otherwise adversely impact our operations. \n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS \n\nPandemics, epidemics or endemic diseases could further negatively impact us, our customers, our supply chain and our operations. The magnitude and duration of a pandemic, epidemic or endemic disease, and its impact on our customers and general economic conditions can influence the demand for our services and affect our revenues. In addition, such outbreaks could affect our operations and business continuity if a significant number of our essential employees, overall or in a key location, are quarantined from contraction of or exposure to the disease or if governmental orders prevent our employees or critical suppliers from working. To the extent such diseases adversely affect our business and financial results, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors included herein, or may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us. \n\nA significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our business operations. We rely on information technology, and improvements in that technology, in all aspects of our business. If we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of information technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, data breach, or other operational difficulties. Although we maintain comprehensive security programs designed to protect our information technology systems, we are continually targeted by threat actors attempting to access our networks. While we have previously experienced cybersecurity events that have had minimal impact, future events may result in more significant impacts to our operations, reputation or results of operations. These potentially impactful events could include unauthorized access to our systems, viruses, ransomware, and/or compromise, acquisition, or destruction of our data. We also could be impacted by cybersecurity events targeting third parties that we rely on for business operations, including third party vendors that have access to our systems or data and third parties in our supply chain. Such a direct or indirect cybersecurity incident could interrupt our service, cause safety failures or operational difficulties, decrease revenues, increase operating costs, impact our efficiency, damage our corporate reputation, and/or expose us to litigation or government action or increased regulation, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments. In addition, our failure to comply with privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in government investigations and proceedings against us, or litigation, resulting in adverse reputational impacts, penalties, and legal liability. \n\nK12 \n\nOur business may be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate our information technology systems. If we fail to develop, acquire or implement new technology, or otherwise fail to maintain, protect or integrate our information technology systems, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing alternative modes of transportation service. \n\nAs a common carrier by rail, we must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk. Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property (including environmental) damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network. The costs of a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage. We have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us. \n\nWe face competition from other transportation providers. We are subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and quality and reliability of service. While we have primarily used internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements, expenditures, legislation, or regulation changing or materially increasing the efficiency or reducing the cost of one or more alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate (such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption and utilization of autonomous commercial vehicles) could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with other modes of transportation. \n\nCapacity constraints could negatively impact our service and operating efficiency. We have experienced and may again experience capacity constraints on our rail network related to employee or equipment shortages, increased demand for rail services, severe weather, congestion on other railroads, including passenger activities, or impacts from changes to our network structure or composition. Such constraints could result in operational inefficiencies or adversely affect our operations. \n\nSignificant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and resources like locomotives. Changes in workforce demographics, training requirements, and availability of qualified personnel, particularly for engineers and conductors, have negatively impacted and may again negatively impact our ability to meet short-term demand for rail service. Unpredicted increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks and could negatively impact our operational efficiency. \n\nConstraints on the supply chain or the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations. Our ability to provide rail service to our customers depends in large part upon a functioning global supply chain and our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers (including shortlines and regional railroads) with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. Deterioration in the supply chain or operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in our inability to meet our customers&#8217; demands or require us to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies. Additionally, any significant consolidations, mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach. \n\nWe may be negatively affected by terrorism or war. Any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption. Because we play a critical role in the nation&#8217;s transportation system, we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government&#8217;s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war. \n\nAlthough we currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in our care, \n\nK13 \n\ncustody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism. In addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future. \n\nWe may be negatively affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets. We consumed approximately 376 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2022. Fuel availability could be affected by limitation in the fuel supply or by imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. A severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies. \n\nDue to the capital-intensive nature, as well as the industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment. Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials. Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials. \n\nLITIGATION RISKS \n\nWe may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters. Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employer&#8217;s Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELA&#8217;s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker&#8217;s compensation system. The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded. \n\nA catastrophic rail accident, whether on our lines or another carrier&#8217;s, involving any or all of release of hazardous materials, freight loss, property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could compromise critical parts of our rail network. Losses associated with such an accident involving us could exceed our insurance coverage, resulting in a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Any material changes to current litigation trends could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance. \n\nWe have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages; however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us. \n\nHUMAN CAPITAL RISKS \n\nThe vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions, and the renegotiation of labor agreements or any provisions thereof, or any strikes or work stoppages (including any entered into in connection with any such negotiations), could adversely affect our operations. Approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Although we recently entered into updated labor agreements with these labor unions, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits. Additionally, if our craft employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, including in connection with the renegotiation of any such agreements or any provisions thereof, we could experience a significant disruption in our operations, thereby adversely impacting our results of operations. \n\nFailure to attract and retain key executive officers, or skilled professional or technical employees could adversely impact our business and operations. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, including a sufficient number of craft employees to enable us to efficiently conduct our operations. \n\nK14 \n\nDifficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled employees, including train and engine workers, key executives, and other skilled professional and technical employees; the unexpected loss of such individuals; and/or our inability to successfully transition key roles could each have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. \n\nCLIMATE CHANGE RISKS \n\nSevere weather and disasters have caused, and could again cause, significant business interruptions and expenditures. Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena resulting from changing weather patterns and rising sea levels or other causes, including hurricanes, floods, fires, landslides, extreme temperatures, significant precipitation, and earthquakes, have caused, and may again cause damage to our network, our workforce to be unavailable and us to be unable to use our equipment. Additionally, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions, which could cause more significant business interruptions that result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues. \n\nConcern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other legislative or regulatory controls on GHG emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease the amount of traffic we handle. \n\nIn addition, legislation and regulation related to climate change or GHG emissions could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers. Even without legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to climate change or GHG emissions could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry, or our customers that use commodities we carry to produce energy (including coal), use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy associated with GHG emissions. \n\nMACROECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS \n\nWe may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic conditions. Negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions, including reduced import and export volumes, could affect the producers and consumers of the freight we carry. Economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers. \n\nWe may be negatively affected by energy prices. Volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude oil, natural gas, and coal; fuel prices; and, fuel surcharges. \n\nThe state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity. We rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of debt instruments and the sale of certain receivables. Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial position due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial position, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n&#160; \n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. \n\n&#160; \n\nOVERVIEW \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are one of the nation&#8217;s premier transportation companies, moving goods and materials that help drive the U.S. economy. We connect customers to markets and communities to economic opportunity with safe, reliable, and cost-effective shipping solutions. Our Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates in 22 states and the District of Columbia. We are a major transporter of industrial products, including agriculture, forest and consumer products, chemicals, and metals and construction materials. In addition, in the East we serve every major container port and operate the most extensive intermodal network. We are also a principal carrier of coal, automobiles, and automotive parts. \n\nIn 2022, revenue growth led to year-over-year improvements in income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share. Throughout the year, we focused on efforts to increase our network fluidity and improve service for our customers. These efforts included the hiring of new conductors in a tight labor market and evolving our operating plan, which collectively drove improvements in our network performance as we concluded the year and is providing strong momentum going into 2023. Additionally, new labor agreements were secured by December 2022 which provided retroactive pay and other benefits for our craft employees. As we head into 2023, we are focused on providing reliable and resilient service and delivering smart sustainable revenue growth that will deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. \n\nSUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 &#160; ($ in millions, except per share amounts) (% change) Income from railway operations $ 4,809 $ 4,447 $ 3,002 8 % 48 % Net income $ 3,270 $ 3,005 $ 2,013 9 % 49 % Diluted earnings per share $ 13.88 $ 12.11 $ 7.84 15 % 54 % Railway operating ratio (percent) 62.3 60.1 69.3 4 % (13 %) ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome from railway operations increased in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher railway operating revenues. Revenue growth was the result of higher fuel surcharge revenues and pricing gains, which more than offset the impact of volume declines. The rise in revenues was partly offset by increased railway operating expenses, driven by higher fuel prices, other inflationary pressures, service-related costs, increased labor-related costs primarily resulting from labor union negotiations, and higher claims-related expenses. Incremental expenses incurred in 2022 that resulted from finalized labor agreements for wages earned in 2021 and prior periods lowered diluted earnings per share by $0.18. Additionally, net income includes a $136 million deferred tax benefit resulting from a corporate income tax rate change in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.58. Our share repurchase activity resulted in the percentage increase in diluted earnings per share that exceeded that of net income. Railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) increased to 62.3 percent. \n\nIncome from railway operations increased in 2021 compared to 2020, the result of a 14% increase in railway operating revenues and a 1% reduction in railway operating expenses. Revenue growth was driven by increased average revenue per unit and higher volumes, the result of improved customer demand. The decline in railway \n\nK19 \n\noperating expenses was largely due to the absence of two charges, as 2020 results were adversely impacted by a $385 million loss on asset disposal related to locomotives and a $99 million impairment charge related to an equity method investment. For more information on these charges, see Notes 7 and 6, respectively. Higher fuel costs, purchased services, and compensation and benefits expense mostly offset the reduction associated with these charges. Additionally, gains on the sale of operating properties increased compared to 2020. The 48% increase in income from railway operations drove comparable increases in net income and diluted earnings per share. Our railway operating ratio decreased to 60.1 percent. \n\nThe following tables adjust our 2020 U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial results to exclude the effects of the loss on asset disposal and investment impairment. The income tax effects on these non-GAAP adjustments were calculated based on the applicable tax rates to which the non-GAAP adjustments relate. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making period-to-period comparisons by excluding the 2020 charges. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. \n\n##TABLE_START Non-GAAP Reconciliation for 2020 Reported (GAAP) Loss on Asset Disposal Investment Impairment Adjusted (non-GAAP) ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Railway operating expenses $ 6,787 $ (385) $ (99) $ 6,303 Income from railway operations $ 3,002 $ 385 $ 99 $ 3,486 Income before income taxes $ 2,530 $ 385 $ 99 $ 3,014 Income taxes $ 517 $ 97 $ 25 $ 639 Net income $ 2,013 $ 288 $ 74 $ 2,375 Diluted earnings per share $ 7.84 $ 1.12 $ 0.29 $ 9.25 Railway operating ratio (percent) 69.3 (3.9) (1.0) 64.4 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the table below, references to 2020 results and related comparisons use the adjusted, non-GAAP results from the table above. \n\n##TABLE_START 2021 Adjusted 2022 vs. Adjusted 2020 vs. 2020 2022 2021 (non-GAAP) 2021 (non-GAAP) &#160; ($ in millions, except per share amounts) (% change) Railway operating expenses $ 7,936 $ 6,695 $ 6,303 19 % 6 % Income from railway operations $ 4,809 $ 4,447 $ 3,486 8 % 28 % Income before income taxes $ 4,130 $ 3,878 $ 3,014 6 % 29 % Income taxes $ 860 $ 873 $ 639 (1 %) 37 % Net income $ 3,270 $ 3,005 $ 2,375 9 % 27 % Diluted earnings per share $ 13.88 $ 12.11 $ 9.25 15 % 31 % Railway operating ratio (percent) 62.3 60.1 64.4 4 % (7 %) ##TABLE_END\n\nK20 \n\nDETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nRailway Operating Revenues \n\nThe following tables present a three-year comparison of revenues, volumes (units), and average revenue per unit by commodity group. ##TABLE_START Revenues 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 ($ in millions) (% change) Merchandise: Agriculture, forest and consumer products $ 2,493 $ 2,251 $ 2,116 11 % 6 % Chemicals 2,148 1,951 1,809 10 % 8 % Metals and construction 1,652 1,562 1,333 6 % 17 % Automotive 1,038 905 830 15 % 9 % Merchandise 7,331 6,669 6,088 10 % 10 % Intermodal 3,681 3,163 2,654 16 % 19 % Coal 1,733 1,310 1,047 32 % 25 % Total $ 12,745 $ 11,142 $ 9,789 14 % 14 % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Units 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 (in thousands) (% change) Merchandise: Agriculture, forest and consumer products 723.0 725.5 704.4 &#8212; % 3 % Chemicals 540.1 529.7 482.0 2 % 10 % Metals and construction 634.6 669.0 601.2 (5 %) 11 % Automotive 339.1 345.4 329.7 (2 %) 5 % Merchandise 2,236.8 2,269.6 2,117.3 (1 %) 7 % Intermodal 3,913.1 4,104.1 3,992.1 (5 %) 3 % Coal 684.6 658.0 574.1 4 % 15 % Total 6,834.5 7,031.7 6,683.5 (3 %) 5 % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Revenue per Unit 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 ($ per unit) (% change) Merchandise: Agriculture, forest and consumer products $ 3,448 $ 3,102 $ 3,004 11 % 3 % Chemicals 3,978 3,684 3,753 8 % (2 %) Metals and construction 2,604 2,334 2,216 12 % 5 % Automotive 3,059 2,621 2,518 17 % 4 % Merchandise 3,277 2,938 2,875 12 % 2 % Intermodal 941 771 665 22 % 16 % Coal 2,532 1,991 1,824 27 % 9 % Total 1,865 1,584 1,465 18 % 8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nK21 \n\nRevenues increased $1.6 billion in 2022 and $1.4 billion in 2021 compared to the prior years. Higher revenue for 2022 was the result of increased average revenue per unit, driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue, pricing gains, improved mix, and increased intermodal storage service charges, partially offset by volume declines. In 2021, higher revenue was the result of increased average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains, higher fuel surcharge revenue, increased intermodal storage service charges and improved mix, as well as volume growth. \n\nThe table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) ($ in millions) Merchandise Intermodal Coal Merchandise Intermodal Coal Volume $ (96) $ (147) $ 53 $ 438 $ 75 $ 153 Fuel surcharge revenue 455 417 79 91 178 4 Rate, mix and other 303 248 291 52 256 106 Total $ 662 $ 518 $ 423 $ 581 $ 509 $ 263 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nApproximately 95% of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenues totaled $1.6 billion, $622 million, and $349 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in fuel surcharge revenues in 2022 and 2021 was driven by higher fuel commodity prices. \n\nFor 2023, we expect that revenue growth will be a challenge, as there is substantial economic uncertainty. Additionally, we expect revenue headwinds resulting from lower fuel prices, softening coal pricing, and declining storage service charges. In this difficult environment, we will continue to fight to increase revenue by recapturing truck-competitive freight and achieving pricing gains. \n\nMERCHANDISE revenues increased in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior years. In 2022, revenues rose due to higher average revenue per unit, driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue and increased pricing, partially offset by lower volume. Decreased volumes in metal and construction and automotive shipments more than offset higher chemical shipments. In 2021, revenues rose due to increased volume and higher average revenue per unit driven by increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing. Volumes increased in all merchandise commodity groups, reflecting economic recovery following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nAgriculture, forest and consumer products revenues increased in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior years. In 2022, the rise was the result of increased average revenue per unit, the result of higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, while volumes were nearly flat. Declines in pulpboard, fertilizer, and pulp, were offset by increases in soybeans, feed, and corn. Pulpboard and pulp shipments declined due to decreased demand, equipment availability, service disruptions, and production down time. Lower fertilizer shipments were driven by high fertilizer prices causing customers to draw down on existing inventories or delay purchases as well as production disruptions. Soybean volumes were higher due to increased opportunity for exports. Feed shipments were higher due to increased customer demand. Increased corn shipments were due to improved equipment cycle times. In 2021, higher revenues were the result of higher volume across almost all markets, as the economy improved from the early months of the pandemic in 2020, and increased average revenue per unit, the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Gains in ethanol, pulpboard, beverages, lumber and wood, and woodchips more than offset declines in soybeans and pulp. \n\nChemicals revenues increased in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior years. In 2022, the increase was the result of higher average revenue per unit, driven by fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, and volume growth. \n\nK22 \n\nIncreases in sand and solid waste shipments were partially offset by declines in plastics, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, and natural gas liquids. The increase in sand was due to greater demand resulting from sustained high natural gas prices. Solid waste shipments increased due to growth with existing customers. Plastics shipments decreased due to softening of the housing market. Declines in inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, and natural gas liquids shipments were due to decreased demand and reduced production. In 2021, the increase was the result of volume growth partially offset by lower average revenue per unit, driven by mix of traffic. The increase in volume was due to economic and production recovery since the beginning of the pandemic, despite ongoing challenges in the energy markets. The markets with the largest gains were solid waste, industrial chemicals, sand, natural gas liquids, and plastics. \n\nMetals and construction revenues were higher in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior years. In 2022, revenue growth was driven by higher average revenue per unit, the result of higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, partially offset by lower volume. Volumes fell largely as a result of decreased shipments of coil steel, iron and steel, and scrap metal driven by service disruptions and slower equipment cycle times. In 2021, revenue growth was driven by increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit, the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Volume increased across almost all markets due to economic improvement since the beginning of the pandemic. The commodities serving the metal production industry, including coil steel, scrap metal, and iron and steel, experienced the largest gains. \n\nAutomotive revenues rose in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior years. The increase in revenues in 2022 was driven by higher average revenue per unit, due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, partially offset by volume declines. Volume declines were the result of slower equipment cycle times partially offset by fewer parts supply issues due to easing supply chain congestion when compared to the prior year. In 2021, the increase in revenues was driven by volume growth and higher average revenue per unit, a result of an increase in fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains. Automotive volumes were higher due primarily to increased retail demand and the impact of prior-year pandemic-induced production shutdowns. This was partially offset by the impact of the microchip shortage on production. \n\nINTERMODAL revenues increased in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior years. The increase in 2022 was the result of higher average revenue per unit, driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue, pricing gains, and increased storage service charges, partially offset by decreased volume. The rise in 2021 was primarily the result of higher average revenue per unit driven by increased storage service charges, higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains. \n\nIntermodal units by market were as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 &#160; (units in thousands) (% change) Domestic 2,573.6 2,630.6 2,568.7 (2 %) 2 % International 1,339.5 1,473.5 1,423.4 (9 %) 4 % Total 3,913.1 4,104.1 3,992.1 (5 %) 3 % ##TABLE_END\n\nDomestic volume decreased in 2022 but increased in 2021 compared with the prior years. In 2022, volume declined due to service disruptions, terminal congestion, strong over-the-road competition, and increased truck availability. In 2021, volume rose due to strong consumer demand which was partially offset by overall supply chain congestion, including equipment availability issues. \n\nInternational volume fell in 2022 but rose in 2021. The decline in 2022 was the result of supply chain constraints, chassis shortages, and excess retail inventory. The increase in 2021 was the result of strong import demand despite being limited by various supply chain constraints, including chassis availability issues. \n\nK23 \n\nCOAL revenues increased in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior years. The increase in 2022 was due to higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue, and increased volumes. The increase in 2021 was due to increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and positive mix. \n\nAs shown in the following table, total tonnage increased in both 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 &#160; (tons in thousands) (% change) Utility 35,705 33,169 32,479 8 % 2 % Export 25,887 24,886 18,900 4 % 32 % Domestic metallurgical 11,307 11,804 9,441 (4 %) 25 % Industrial 3,765 3,595 3,566 5 % 1 % Total 76,664 73,454 64,386 4 % 14 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nUtility coal tonnage increased in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior years. The increase in 2022 was due to increased demand and service improvements. The increase in 2021 was due to higher natural gas prices and increased demand from coal-sourced electrical generation. \n\nExport coal tonnage increased in both periods compared with prior years. The increase in 2022 was a result of strong global demand and increased coal supply. The increase in 2021 was a result of strong seaborne pricing, improved global economic conditions, and greater global demand. \n\n&#160; \n\nDomestic metallurgical coal tonnage decreased in 2022 but increased in 2021 compared with the prior years. The decrease in 2022 was the result of reduced coke shipments related to customer sourcing changes and idled customer facilities. The increase in 2021 was the result of strong recovery in the steel market. \n\nIndustrial coal tonnage increased in both 2022 and 2021 compared with the prior year as a result of increased demand. \n\nRailway Operating Expenses \n\nRailway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 &#160; ($ in millions) (% change) Compensation and benefits $ 2,621 $ 2,442 $ 2,373 7 % 3 % Purchased services and rents 1,922 1,726 1,687 11 % 2 % Fuel 1,459 799 535 83 % 49 % Depreciation 1,221 1,181 1,154 3 % 2 % Materials and other 713 547 653 30 % (16 %) Loss on asset disposal &#8212; &#8212; 385 Total $ 7,936 $ 6,695 $ 6,787 19 % (1 %) ##TABLE_END\n\nK24 \n\nIn 2022, expenses increased primarily as a result of higher fuel prices, other inflationary pressures, service-related costs, increased labor-related costs resulting from labor union negotiations, and higher claims expenses. In 2021, expenses declined primarily as a result of the absence of the 2020 loss on asset disposal and the equity method investment impairment charge, which is included in purchased services and rents. This was partially offset by higher fuel costs, increased other purchased services, and higher compensation and benefits expense. \n\nCompensation and benefits increased in 2022, reflecting changes in: \n\n&#8226; increased pay rates (up $188 million), \n\n&#8226; employee activity levels (up $51 million), \n\n&#8226; overtime (up $18 million), \n\n&#8226; incentive and stock-based compensation (down $79 million), and \n\n&#8226; other (up $1 million). \n\nThe increase in pay rates in 2022 includes payments in excess of amounts previously estimated in 2021 and 2020 for retroactive wage increases and other benefits under our labor agreements. In 2022, compensation and benefits includes $54 million and purchased services includes $2 million of additional expenses pertaining to compensation earned in those periods. \n\nIn 2021, compensation and benefits increased, a result of changes in: \n\n&#8226; incentive and stock-based compensation (up $128 million), \n\n&#8226; overtime and recrews (up $47 million), \n\n&#8226; increased pay rates (up $41 million), \n\n&#8226; health and welfare benefits for craft employees (down $19 million), \n\n&#8226; employee activity levels (down $154 million), and \n\n&#8226; other (up $26 million). \n\nOur employment averaged 18,900 in 2022, compared with 18,500 in 2021, and 20,200 in 2020. \n\nPurchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from external vendors and contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 &#160; 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 &#160; ($ in millions) (% change) Purchased services $ 1,565 $ 1,409 $ 1,387 11 % 2 % Equipment rents 357 317 300 13 % 6 % Total $ 1,922 $ 1,726 $ 1,687 11 % 2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in purchased services in 2022 was due to inflationary pressures which resulted in higher intermodal-related expenses, and increased operational and transportation expenses, as well as higher technology-related costs. The increase in purchased services in 2021 was due to increased technology costs, higher intermodal-related expenses, and increased Conrail, Inc. (Conrail) costs. This was partially offset by the absence of a prior year $99 million impairment related to an equity method investment. \n\nEquipment rents, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, increased in both periods. In 2022, the increase was the result of lower network fluidity which led to greater time-and-mileage expenses, increased automotive and \n\nK25 \n\nintermodal equipment expenses, and higher short-term locomotive resource costs. In 2021, equipment rents were higher for general-use equipment due to decreased network velocity and increased volume. These increases were partially offset by lower intermodal costs and higher equity in TTX earnings. \n\nFuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, increased in both periods. The change in both years was due to higher locomotive fuel prices (up 87% in 2022 and 43% in 2021) which increased expenses by $634 million in 2022 and $224 million in 2021. Locomotive fuel consumption decreased 2% in 2022, but increased 4% in 2021. We consumed 376 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2022, compared with 384 million gallons in 2021 and 368 million gallons in 2020. \n\nDepreciation expense increased in both periods, a reflection of reinvestment in our infrastructure, rolling stock, and technology. \n\nMaterials and other expenses increased in 2022 but decreased in 2021 as shown in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 &#160; 2022 2021 2020 vs. 2021 vs. 2020 &#160; ($ in millions) (% change) Materials $ 283 $ 250 $ 274 13 % (9 %) Claims 270 165 179 64 % (8 %) Other 160 132 200 21 % (34 %) Total $ 713 $ 547 $ 653 30 % (16 %) ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMaterials expense increased in 2022 but decreased in 2021. The increase in 2022 is due to increased locomotive, freight car, and track materials costs. In 2021, the decrease was due primarily to lower maintenance requirements as a result of fewer locomotives and freight cars in service. \n\nClaims expense includes costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters. The increase in 2022 was primarily the result of higher costs associated with unfavorable personal injury case development, increased environmental remediation expenses, and higher lading and property damage costs. The decrease in 2021 was primarily the result of lower costs associated with derailments and personal injuries. \n\nOther expense increased in 2022, primarily due to higher travel-related expenses, increased non-income based taxes, and lower gains from sales of operating property, partially offset by lower relocation expenses. In 2021, other expense decreased primarily due to higher gains from sales of operating property. Gains from operating property sales amounted to $76 million, $82 million, and $26 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nLoss on asset disposal \n\nDuring 2020, we recorded a $385 million charge related to the disposal of 703 locomotives. For more information on the impact of the charge, see Note 7. \n\nOther income &#8211; net \n\nOther income &#8211; net decreased in both 2022 and 2021. Other income fell in 2022 due to lower net returns on corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) partially offset by a higher net pension benefit and increased interest income. The decrease in 2021 was driven by lower net returns on COLI and lower gains on sales of non-operating property. \n\nK26 \n\nIncome taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nThe effective income tax rate was 20.8% in 2022, compared with 22.5% in 2021 and 20.4% in 2020. The current year benefited by $136 million due to an enacted reduction to the Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate while 2021 benefited by $34 million due to various state law changes (see Note 4). All years experienced favorable benefits associated with stock-based compensation, while 2021 and 2020 benefited from COLI returns. \n\nFor 2023, we expect an effective income tax rate between 23% and 24%. \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operating activities, our principal source of liquidity, was $4.2 billion in 2022, $4.3 billion in 2021, and $3.6 billion in 2020. The decrease in 2022 reflected changes in working capital, offset in part by improved operating results. The increase in 2021 was primarily the result of improved operating results. We had negative working capital of $642 million at December 31, 2022 and $354 million at December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $456 million and $839 million at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We expect that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations. In addition, we believe our currently-available borrowing capacity, access to additional financing, and ability to reduce property additions and shareholder distributions, including share repurchases, provides us additional flexibility to meet our ongoing obligations. \n\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2022, including those that may have material cash requirements, include interest on fixed-rate long-term debt, long-term debt (Note 9), unconditional purchase obligations (Note 17), long-term advances from Conrail (Note 6), operating leases (Note 10), agreements with Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC) (Note 6), and unrecognized tax benefits (Note 4). \n\n##TABLE_START Total 2023 2024 - 2025 2026 - 2027 2028 and Subsequent &#160; ($ in millions) Interest on fixed-rate long-term debt $ 17,085 $ 643 $ 1,239 $ 1,144 $ 14,059 Long-term debt principal 16,012 603 957 1,223 13,229 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,650 757 736 80 77 Long-term advances from Conrail 534 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 534 Operating leases 462 103 182 96 81 Agreements with CRC 272 42 84 84 62 Unrecognized tax benefits* 22 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 22 Total $ 36,037 $ 2,148 $ 3,198 $ 2,627 $ 28,064 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n* This amount is shown in the 2028 and Subsequent column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. \n\n&#160; \n\nOff balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of unrecognized obligations, including unconditional purchase obligations and future interest payments on fixed-rate long-term debt, which are included in the table above. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2022, and $1.2 billion in both 2021 and 2020. The increase in 2022 is due to higher property additions partially offset by increased proceeds from property sales. In 2021, lower proceeds from property sales were mostly offset by reduced COLI policy loan repayments and lower property additions. \n\nK27 \n\nCapital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the &#8220;Railway Property&#8221; section of Part I of this report on Form 10-K. For 2023, we expect property additions will be approximately $2.1 billion. \n\nIn November 2022, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Cincinnati Southern Railway to purchase approximately 337 miles of railway line that extends from Cincinnati, Ohio to Chattanooga, Tennessee which we currently operate under a lease agreement. The total purchase price for the line and other associated real and personal property included in the transaction is approximately $1.6 billion. The agreement is conditioned upon (i) certain changes to Ohio state law applicable to the use of the related sale proceeds, (ii) approval by the voters of the City of Cincinnati, and (iii) the receipt of regulatory approval from the STB. The agreement includes various termination provisions including termination at any time prior to closing by the mutual written consent of the parties, termination at any time after December 31, 2024 by the mutual written consent of the parties, termination by us if the STB takes action that we deem unsatisfactory, and termination by either party if Cincinnati voter approval is not obtained on or before the later of June 30, 2025 and the calendar date on which the polls are open for the 2025 Cincinnati primary election. \n\nCash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion in 2022, compared with $3.3 billion in 2021, and $1.9 billion in 2020. The decrease in 2022 reflects lower repurchases of Common Stock, and increased proceeds from borrowings, partially offset by higher dividends. In 2021, the increase reflects higher repurchases of Common Stock and debt repayments, partially offset by increased proceeds from borrowings. \n\nShare repurchases of $3.1 billion in 2022, $3.4 billion in 2021, and $1.4 billion in 2020 resulted in the retirement of 12.6 million, 12.7 million, and 7.4 million shares, respectively. On March 29, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to an additional $10.0 billion of Common Stock beginning April 1, 2022. Our previous share repurchase program terminated on March 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, $7.5 billion remains authorized by our Board of Directors for repurchase. The timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors. Repurchases may be executed in the open market, through derivatives, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) and Rule 10b-18 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally-generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings. \n\nIn June 2022, we issued $750 million of 4.55% senior notes due 2053. \n\nIn February 2022, we issued $600 million of 3.00% senior notes due 2032 and $400 million of 3.70% senior notes due 2053. \n\nIn May 2022, we renewed our accounts receivable securitization program with a maximum borrowing capacity of $400 million. The term expires in May 2023. We had $100 million in borrowings outstanding under this program and our available borrowing capacity was $300 million at December 31, 2022 and $400 million at December 31, 2021. \n\nWe also have in place and available an $800 million credit agreement expiring in March 2025, which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility at either December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021, and we are in compliance with all of its covenants. \n\nIn addition, we have investments in general purpose COLI policies and had the ability to borrow against these policies up to $610 million and $715 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nOur debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 54.4% at December 31, 2022, compared with 50.4% at December 31, 2021. We discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in Note 9. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we issued $500 million in fixed rate debt securities. These senior notes, issued February 2, 2023, carry an interest rate of 4.45% and mature in 2033. After this issuance, we have authority from our Board of \n\nK28 \n\nDirectors to issue an additional $800 million of debt or equity securities through public or private sale, all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise. \n\n&#160; \n\nUpcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in Note 9. Overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\n&#160; \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The following critical accounting estimates are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. \n\n&#160; \n\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (Note 12). These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans&#8217; assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality. In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value. We make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance). We utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm&#8217;s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor 2022, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.0%, which was supported by our long-term total rate of return on pension plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns. A one-percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $26 million change in annual pension expense. We review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. The net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments. We utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds. We use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans. A one-percentage point change to this discount rate assumption would result in a $3 million change in annual pension expense. \n\nProperties and Depreciation \n\n&#160; \n\nMost of our assets are long-lived railway properties (Note 7). &#8220;Properties&#8221; are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate. See Note 1 for a more detailed discussion of assumptions and estimates. \n\nExpenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an asset&#8217;s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized. Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor, and other direct costs, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project. A significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to self-constructed assets. Costs related to repairs and \n\nK29 \n\nmaintenance activities that, in our judgment, do not extend an asset&#8217;s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed. \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation expense for 2022 totaled $1.2 billion. Our composite depreciation rates for 2022 are disclosed in Note 7; a one-year increase (or decrease) in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate $44 million decrease (or increase) to annual depreciation expense. \n\nPersonal Injury \n\n&#160; \n\nClaims expense, included in &#8220;Materials and other&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income, includes our estimate of costs for personal injuries. \n\n&#160; \n\nTo aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent actuarial consulting firm. The actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. The accuracy of our estimate of the liability is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and, as such, the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded. \n\nSee Note 17 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates we use for personal injury. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nOur net deferred tax liability totaled $7.3 billion at December 31, 2022 (Note 4). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns. For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have a $41 million valuation allowance on $373 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, reflecting the expectation that substantially all of these assets will be realized. \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\n&#160; \n\nLabor Agreements \n\nApproximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA), these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the RLA are completed. Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements. We largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers&#8217; Conference Committee. \n\nAfter management and the unions served their formal proposals in November 2019 for changes to the collective bargaining agreements, negotiations began in 2020 following the expiration of the last moratorium. On June 17, 2022, the National Mediation Board notified the parties that all practical methods of ending the dispute had been exhausted without effecting a settlement and that its mediation services had been terminated. Shortly thereafter, President Biden created Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) No. 250, effective July 18, 2022, to investigate the facts of the dispute and make recommendations. The PEB issued its recommendations on August 16, 2022, and the parties engaged in further negotiations. By December 2022, agreements based on the PEB&#8217;s recommendations had either been ratified or enacted through legislative action for all twelve unions. \n\nK30 \n\nWhile the parties are engaged in additional discussions to conclude the implementation of the recently finalized agreements, neither party can compel mandatory bargaining around any new proposals until November 1, 2024. That said, we understand the imperative to continue improving quality of life for our craft employees and are actively engaged in voluntary discussions (which carry no risk of a work stoppage) with all of our unions on this important issue. \n\nMarket Risks \n\n&#160; \n\nWe manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating- rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2022, debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $100 million. A one-percentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately $1 million. Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a one-percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and amounts to an increase of approximately $1.3 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2022. We consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nFor a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1. \n\nInflation \n\n&#160; \n\nIn preparing financial statements, GAAP requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. As a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain statements in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

In order to ensure that Norfolk Southern&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently as of December 31, 2022. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nKPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our financial statements and issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START /s/ Alan H.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in stockholders&#8217; equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts as listed in Item 15(A)2 (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 3, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nK35 \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nKPMG LLP \n\nAtlanta, Georgia \n\nFebruary 3, 2023 \n\nK36 \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\n&#160; \n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors \n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation: \n\n&#160; \n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in stockholders&#8217; equity for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts as listed in Item 15(A)2 (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three&#8209;year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 3, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nK37 \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nSufficiency of audit evidence related to the capitalization of property expenditures \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, expenditures that extend an asset&#8217;s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized. The Company has recorded $32,156 million in net book value of properties at December 31, 2022 and has recorded $1,948 million in property additions for the year ended December 31, 2022. Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor and other direct costs, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project. A significant portion of the Company&#8217;s annual capital spending relates to self-constructed assets. Costs related to repair and maintenance activities, that in the Company&#8217;s judgment, do not extend an asset&#8217;s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed. \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence related to capitalization of property expenditures as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required in determining procedures and evaluating audit results related to the capitalization of purchased services and compensation due to their usage for both self-constructed assets and repairs and maintenance. \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over capitalized property expenditures. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company&#8217;s process to capitalize property expenditures, including controls over the determination of whether purchased services and compensation expenditures extend an asset&#8217;s useful life or increase its utility. For a sample of property addition expenditures, we inquired and inspected support to evaluate that the expenditure extended an asset&#8217;s useful life or increased its utility. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of the procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature of such evidence. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nKPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1982. \n\nAtlanta, Georgia \n\nFebruary 3, 2023 \n\nK38 \n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries \n\nConsolidated Statements of Income \n\n&#160;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\n&#160; \n\nDescription of Business \n\n&#160; \n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation is a Georgia-based holding company engaged principally in the rail transportation business, operating 19,100 route miles primarily in the Southeast, East, and Midwest. These consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, NS, we, us, and our). Norfolk Southern&#8217;s major subsidiary is NSR. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \n\n&#160; \n\nNSR and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods classified in the following commodity groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in 2022): intermodal ( 29 %); agriculture, forest and consumer products ( 19 %); chemicals ( 17 %); coal ( 14 %); metals and construction ( 13 %); and automotive ( 8 %). Although most of our customers are domestic, ultimate points of origination or destination for some of the products transported (particularly coal bound for export and some intermodal shipments) may be outside the U.S. Approximately 80 % of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. \n\n&#160; \n\nUse of Estimates \n\n&#160; \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We periodically review our estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims, income taxes and pension and other postretirement benefits. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n&#160; \n\nTransportation revenues are recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to destination, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. Certain of our contract refunds (which are primarily volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on the basis of our best estimate of projected liability, which is based on historical activity, current shipment counts and expectation of future activity. Certain ancillary services, such as switching, demurrage and other incidental activities, may be provided to customers under their transportation contracts. The revenues associated with these distinct performance obligations are recognized when the services are performed or as contractual obligations are met. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Equivalents \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8220;Cash equivalents&#8221; are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\n&#160; \n\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 9 million and $ 8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. To determine our allowance for doubtful accounts, we evaluate historical loss experience (which has not been significant), the characteristics of current accounts, and general economic conditions and trends. \n\nK44 \n\nMaterials and Supplies \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8220;Materials and supplies,&#8221; consisting mainly of items for maintenance of property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in property additions or improvements is included in &#8220;Properties.&#8221; \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control the entity are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the investment is carried at the cost of the acquisition plus our equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition. \n\n&#160; \n\nProperties \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8220;Properties&#8221; are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate. This methodology treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items. We use approximately 75 depreciable asset classes. \n\nDepreciation expense is based on our assumptions concerning expected service lives of our properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement. In developing these assumptions, we utilize periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the STB. Our depreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property. The frequency of these studies is consistent with guidelines established by the STB. We adjust our rates based on the results of these studies and implement the changes prospectively. The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study. \n\nKey factors that are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include: \n\n&#8226; statistical analysis of historical retirement data and surviving asset records, \n\n&#8226; review of historical salvage received and current market rates, \n\n&#8226; review of our operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies, \n\n&#8226; review of accounting policies and assumptions, and \n\n&#8226; industry review and analysis. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe composite depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross tons as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors. Our experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in the determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors. In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second-hand) and type (curved or straight). \n\n&#160; \n\nWe capitalize interest on major projects during the period of their construction. Expenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an asset&#8217;s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized. Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor, and other direct costs, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project. A significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to self-constructed assets. Removal activities occur in conjunction with replacement and are estimated based on the average percentage of time employees replacing assets spend on removal functions. Costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that, in our judgment, do not extend an asset&#8217;s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed. \n\n&#160; \n\nK45 \n\nWhen depreciable operating road and equipment assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sales proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings. Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with most equipment assets. The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs. When retiring rail, ties and ballast, we use statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired. The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets. These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets. Gains and losses on disposal of operating land are included in &#8220;Materials and other&#8221; expenses. Gains and losses on disposal of non-operating land and non-rail assets are included in &#8220;Other income &#8211; net&#8221; since such income is not a product of our railroad operations. \n\nA retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the ordinary course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recognized in income from railway operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe review the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows. Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. \n\n&#160; \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, &#8220; Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ,&#8221; which added new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes, changed the accounting for certain income tax transactions, and made other minor changes. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2021 and there was no material impact to the financial statements upon adoption. \n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, &#8220; Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance ,&#8221; which requires annual disclosures when an entity has received government assistance. Entities are required to disclose the types of government assistance received, the accounting treatment for that government assistance, and the effect of the government assistance on the financial statements. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2022 and there was no material impact to the financial statements upon adoption. \n\nK46 \n\n2. Railway Operating Revenues \n\nThe following table disaggregates our revenues by major commodity group: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 ($ in millions) Merchandise: Agriculture, forest and consumer products $ 2,493 &#160; $ 2,251 &#160; $ 2,116 &#160; Chemicals 2,148 &#160; 1,951 &#160; 1,809 &#160; Metals and construction 1,652 &#160; 1,562 &#160; 1,333 &#160; Automotive 1,038 &#160; 905 &#160; 830 &#160; Merchandise 7,331 &#160; 6,669 &#160; 6,088 &#160; Intermodal 3,681 &#160; 3,163 &#160; 2,654 &#160; Coal 1,733 &#160; 1,310 &#160; 1,047 &#160; Total $ 12,745 &#160; $ 11,142 &#160; $ 9,789 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nWe recognize the amount of revenues to which we expect to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. A performance obligation is created when a customer under a transportation contract or public tariff submits a bill of lading to us for the transport of goods. These performance obligations are satisfied as the shipments move from origin to destination. As such, transportation revenues are recognized proportionally as a shipment moves, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. These performance obligations are generally short-term in nature with transit days averaging approximately one week or less for each commodity group. The customer has an unconditional obligation to pay for the service once the service has been completed. Estimated revenues associated with in-process shipments at period-end are recorded based on the estimated percentage of service completed. We had no material remaining performance obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nWe may provide customers ancillary services, such as switching, demurrage and other incidental activities, under their transportation contracts. The revenues associated with these distinct performance obligations are recognized when the services are performed or as contractual obligations are met. These revenues are included within each of the commodity groups and represent approximately 7 %, 7 % and 5 %, respectively, of total &#8220;Railway operating revenues&#8221; on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nRevenues related to interline transportation services that involve another railroad are reported on a net basis. Therefore, the portion of the amount that relates to another party is not reflected in revenues. \n\nUnder the typical terms of our freight contracts, payment for services is due within fifteen days of billing the customer, thus there are no significant financing components. &#8220;Accounts receivable &#8211; net&#8221; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both customer and non-customer receivables as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 ($ in millions) Customer $ 895 &#160; $ 741 &#160; Non-customer 253 &#160; 235 &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable &#8211; net $ 1,148 &#160; $ 976 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNon-customer receivables include non-revenue-related amounts due from other railroads, governmental entities, and others. There were no non-current customer receivables at December 31, 2022, while &#8220;Other assets&#8221; on the \n\nK47 \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets included $ 23 million at December 31, 2021. We do no t have any material contract assets or liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n3.

GAAP requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. As a result, in 2022, we recognized a $ 136 million benefit in &#8220;Income taxes&#8221; with a corresponding reduction in &#8220;Deferred income taxes.&#8221; \n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities \n\nCertain items are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in recognition of these differences. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; ($ in millions) Deferred tax assets: &#160; &#160; Accruals, including casualty and other claims $ 110 &#160; $ 92 &#160; Compensation and benefits, including postretirement benefits 99 &#160; 181 &#160; Other 164 &#160; 188 &#160; Total gross deferred tax assets 373 &#160; 461 &#160; Less valuation allowance ( 41 ) ( 60 ) Net deferred tax assets 332 &#160; 401 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: &#160; &#160; Property ( 7,050 ) ( 7,016 ) Other ( 547 ) ( 550 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 7,597 ) ( 7,566 ) Deferred income taxes $ ( 7,265 ) $ ( 7,165 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nExcept for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided, we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance at the end of each year primarily relates to subsidiary state income tax net operating losses and state investment tax credits that may not be utilized prior to their expiration. The total valuation allowance decreased by $ 19 million in 2022 and increased $ 3 million in both 2021 and 2020. \n\nK49 \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\n&#160; \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; ($ in millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 21 &#160; $ 22 &#160; Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 3 &#160; 3 &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years 1 &#160; 3 &#160; Settlements with taxing authorities ( 2 ) ( 5 ) Lapse of statutes of limitations ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Balance at end of year $ 22 &#160; $ 21 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 are potential benefits of $ 18 million that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amount recorded. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe statute of limitations on Internal Revenue Service examinations has expired for all years prior to 2019. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to four years after the return. In addition, we are generally obligated to report changes in taxable income arising from federal income tax examinations to the states within a period of up to two years from the date the federal examination is final. We have various state income tax returns either under examination, administrative appeal, or litigation. &#160; \n\n5. Fair Value Measurements \n\n&#160; \n\nFASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10, &#8220;Fair Value Measurements,&#8221; established a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include: &#160; &#8226; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, \n\n&#8226; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, \n\n&#8226; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and \n\n&#8226; inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by \n\ncorrelation or other means. \n\n&#160; If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. ##TABLE_END\n\nThe asset or liability&#8217;s fair value measurement level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \n\nK50 \n\nFair Values of Financial Instruments \n\nThe fair values of &#8220;Cash and cash equivalents,&#8221; &#8220;Accounts receivable &#8211; net,&#8221; &#8220;Accounts payable,&#8221; and &#8220;Short-term debt&#8221; approximate carrying values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying value of COLI is recorded at cash surrender value and, accordingly, approximates fair value. There are no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 or 2021. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values, based on Level 1 inputs, of long-term debt consist of the following at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value &#160; ($ in millions) Long-term debt, including current maturities $ ( 15,082 ) $ ( 13,846 ) $ ( 13,840 ) $ ( 17,033 ) ##TABLE_END \n\n6. Investments \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; ($ in millions) Long-term investments: &#160; &#160; Equity method investments: &#160; &#160; Conrail $ 1,584 &#160; $ 1,526 &#160; TTX Company 918 &#160; 851 &#160; Other 421 &#160; 420 &#160; Total equity method investments 2,923 &#160; 2,797 &#160; COLI at net cash surrender value 752 &#160; 885 &#160; Other investments 19 &#160; 25 &#160; Total long-term investments $ 3,694 &#160; $ 3,707 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nInvestment in Conrail \n\n&#160; \n\nThrough a limited liability company, we and CSX jointly own Conrail, whose primary subsidiary is CRC. We have a 58 % economic and 50 % voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. We are amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail&#8217;s net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated useful lives of Conrail&#8217;s depreciable property and equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in book and tax accounting bases for such assets, as all of the purchase price at acquisition was allocable to Conrail&#8217;s tangible assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2022, our investment in Conrail exceeds our share of Conrail&#8217;s underlying net equity by $ 480 million. \n\nCRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT). The costs of operating the Shared Assets Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage. In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for access to the Shared Assets Areas. &#8220;Purchased services and rents&#8221; and &#8220;Fuel&#8221; include expenses payable to CRC for operation of the Shared Assets Areas totaling $ 156 million in 2022, $ 147 million in 2021, and $ 129 million in 2020. Future payments for access fees due to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements are as follows: $ 42 million in each of 2023 through 2027 and $ 62 million \n\nK51 \n\nthereafter. We provide certain general and administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed in accordance with several service-provider arrangements and approximate $ 6 million annually. \n\nIn 2020, we converted $ 254 million of accounts payable into long-term advances from Conrail included in &#8220;Other liabilities.&#8221; &#8220;Accounts payable&#8221; includes $ 173 million at December 31, 2022, and $ 112 million at December 31, 2021, due to Conrail for the operation of the Shared Assets Areas. &#8220;Other liabilities&#8221; includes $ 534 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for long-term advances from Conrail, maturing in 2050 that bear interest at an average rate of 1.31 %. \n\nOur equity in Conrail&#8217;s earnings, net of amortization, was $ 58 million for 2022, $ 56 million for 2021, and $ 58 million for 2020. These amounts partially offset the costs of operating the Shared Assets Areas and are included in &#8220;Purchased services and rents.&#8221; Equity in Conrail&#8217;s earnings is included in the &#8220;Other &#8211; net&#8221; line item within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nInvestment in TTX \n\nWe and seven other North American railroads collectively own TTX Company (TTX), a railcar pooling company that provides its owner-railroads with standardized fleets of intermodal, automotive, and general use railcars at stated rates. We have a 19.78 % ownership interest in TTX. \n\nExpenses incurred for use of TTX equipment are included in &#8220;Purchased services and rents.&#8221; This amounted to $ 256 million, $ 246 million, and $ 250 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Our equity in TTX&#8217;s earnings partially offsets these costs and totaled $ 53 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 48 million for 2020. Equity in TTX&#8217;s earnings is included in the &#8220;Other &#8211; net&#8221; line item within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nImpairment of Investment \n\nIn 2020, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $ 99 million related to the carrying value of an equity method investment. This non-cash impairment charge is recorded in &#8220;Purchased services and rents&#8221; on the Consolidated Statements of Income and had a $ 74 million impact on net income. \n\nK52 \n\n7.

The term expires in May 2023. Under this facility NSR sells substantially all of its eligible third-party receivables to a subsidiary, which in turn may transfer beneficial interests in the receivables to various commercial paper vehicles. Amounts received under this facility are accounted for as borrowings. We had $ 100 million (at an average variable interest rate of 5.05 %) outstanding under this program at December 31, 2022, which is included within &#8220;Short-term debt&#8221;, and no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2021. Our available borrowing capacity was $ 300 million and $ 400 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Leases \n\nWe are committed under long-term lease agreements for equipment, lines of road, and other property. We combine lease and non-lease components for new and reassessed leases. Some of these agreements are variable lease agreements that include usage-based payments. These agreements contain payment provisions that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date, and are therefore not included in our future minimum lease payments. Our long-term lease agreements do not contain any material restrictive covenants. \n\nOur equipment leases have remaining terms of less than 1 year to 7 years and our lines of road and land leases have remaining terms of less than 1 year to 135 years. Some of these leases include options to extend the leases for up to 99 years and some include options to terminate the leases within 30 days. Because we are not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term, and associated payments are excluded from future minimum lease payments. \n\nLeases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nK56 \n\nOperating lease amounts included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 ($ in millions) Classification Assets Right-of-use (ROU) assets Other assets $ 407 &#160; $ 411 &#160; Liabilities Current lease liabilities Other current liabilities $ 94 &#160; $ 82 &#160; Non-current lease liabilities Other liabilities 316 &#160; 331 &#160; Total lease liabilities $ 410 &#160; $ 413 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe components of total lease expense, primarily included in &#8220;Purchased services and rents,&#8221; are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 ($ in millions) Operating lease expense $ 101 &#160; $ 106 &#160; $ 109 &#160; Variable lease expense 55 &#160; 44 &#160; 42 &#160; Short-term lease expense 18 &#160; 9 &#160; 9 &#160; Total lease expense $ 174 &#160; $ 159 &#160; $ 160 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn March 2019, we entered into a non-cancellable lease for an office building. In 2021, the construction of the office building was completed and the lease commenced. The initial lease term is five years with options to renew, purchase, or sell the office building at the end of the lease term. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of up to eighty-three percent of the total construction cost of $ 499 million. \n\nOther information related to operating leases is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) on operating leases 6.67 7.49 Weighted-average discount rates on operating leases 3.16 &#160; % 3.04 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nAs the rates implicit in most of our leases are not readily determinable, we use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. We use the portfolio approach and group leases into short-, medium-, and long-term categories, applying the corresponding incremental borrowing rates to these categories. \n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, respectively, ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities were $ 57 million at both periods. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was $ 100 million and $ 103 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in operating cash flows. \n\nK57 \n\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 ($ in millions) 2023 $ 103 &#160; 2024 95 &#160; 2025 87 &#160; 2026 69 &#160; 2027 27 &#160; 2028 and subsequent years 81 &#160; Total lease payments 462 &#160; Less: Interest 52 &#160; Present value of lease liabilities $ 410 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2021 ($ in millions) 2022 $ 92 &#160; 2023 83 &#160; 2024 73 &#160; 2025 69 &#160; 2026 55 &#160; 2027 and subsequent years 98 &#160; Total lease payments 470 &#160; Less: Interest 57 &#160; Present value of lease liabilities $ 413 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n11.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees. We also provide specified health care benefits to eligible retired employees; these plans can be amended or terminated at our option. Under our self-insured retiree health care plan, for those participants who are not Medicare-eligible, certain health care expenses are covered for retired employees and their dependents, reduced by any deductibles, coinsurance, and, in some cases, coverage provided under other group insurance policies. Eligible retired participants and their spouses who are Medicare-eligible are not covered under the self-insured retiree health care plan, but instead are provided with an employer-funded health reimbursement account which can be used for reimbursement of health insurance premiums or eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses. \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations and Plan Assets \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 2022 2021 &#160; ($ in millions) Change in benefit obligations: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 2,777 &#160; $ 2,845 &#160; $ 417 &#160; $ 471 &#160; Service cost 40 &#160; 43 &#160; 6 &#160; 6 &#160; Interest cost 67 &#160; 55 &#160; 9 &#160; 7 &#160; Actuarial gains ( 677 ) ( 13 ) ( 70 ) ( 29 ) Plan amendments ( 4 ) ( 2 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Benefits paid ( 152 ) ( 151 ) ( 36 ) ( 38 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 2,051 &#160; 2,777 &#160; 326 &#160; 417 &#160; Change in plan assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 2,861 &#160; 2,675 &#160; 173 &#160; 165 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 470 ) 317 &#160; ( 28 ) 29 &#160; Employer contributions 21 &#160; 20 &#160; 13 &#160; 17 &#160; Benefits paid ( 152 ) ( 151 ) ( 36 ) ( 38 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 2,260 &#160; 2,861 &#160; 122 &#160; 173 &#160; Funded status at end of year $ 209 &#160; $ 84 &#160; $ ( 204 ) $ ( 244 ) Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other assets $ 484 &#160; $ 442 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Other current liabilities ( 20 ) ( 20 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other liabilities ( 255 ) ( 338 ) ( 204 ) ( 244 ) Net amount recognized $ 209 &#160; $ 84 &#160; $ ( 204 ) $ ( 244 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; loss (before tax): &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net (gain) loss $ 623 &#160; $ 666 &#160; $ ( 19 ) $ 10 &#160; Prior service benefit ( 6 ) ( 2 ) ( 177 ) ( 202 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nK59 \n\nOur accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The estimated net gains and prior service benefit for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit over the next year is $ 26 million. \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits Assumptions \n\n&#160; \n\nCosts for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined based on actuarial valuations that reflect appropriate assumptions as of the measurement date, ordinarily the beginning of each year. The funded status of the plans is determined using appropriate assumptions as of each year end. A summary of the major assumptions follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Pension funded status: &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate 5.56 &#160; % 2.97 &#160; % 2.67 &#160; % Future salary increases 4.44 &#160; % 4.44 &#160; % 4.21 &#160; % Other postretirement benefits funded status: &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate 5.45 &#160; % 2.72 &#160; % 2.27 &#160; % Pension cost: &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate - service cost 3.25 &#160; % 3.14 &#160; % 3.71 &#160; % Discount rate - interest cost 2.45 &#160; % 1.95 &#160; % 2.92 &#160; % Return on assets in plans 8.00 &#160; % 8.00 &#160; % 8.25 &#160; % Future salary increases 4.44 &#160; % 4.44 &#160; % 4.21 &#160; % Other postretirement benefits cost: &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate - service cost \n\n3.01 &#160; % 2.71 &#160; % 3.41 &#160; % Discount rate - interest cost 2.13 &#160; % 1.57 &#160; % 2.69 &#160; % Return on assets in plans 7.75 &#160; % 7.75 &#160; % 8.00 &#160; % Health care trend rate 6.50 &#160; % 6.00 &#160; % 6.25 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nTo determine the discount rates used to measure our benefit obligations, we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and other postretirement benefit plans were matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds. We use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans. \n\nWe use a spot rate approach to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care Cost Trend Assumptions \n\n&#160; \n\nFor measurement purposes at December 31, 2022, increases in the per capita cost of pre-Medicare covered health care benefits were assumed to be 7.0 % for 2023. We assume the rate will ratably decrease to an ultimate rate of 5.0 % for 2030 and remain at that level thereafter. \n\n&#160; \n\nK61 \n\nAssumed health care cost trend rates affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. To illustrate, a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; One-percentage Point &#160; Increase Decrease &#160; ($ in millions) Increase (decrease) in: &#160; &#160; Total service and interest cost components $ 1 &#160; $ ( 1 ) Postretirement benefit obligation 6 &#160; ( 5 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nAsset Management \n\n&#160; \n\nThirteen investment firms manage our defined benefit pension plan&#8217;s assets under investment guidelines approved by our Benefits Investment Committee that is composed of members of our management. Investments are restricted to domestic and international equity securities, domestic and international fixed income securities, and unleveraged exchange-traded options and financial futures. Limitations restrict investment concentration and use of certain derivative investments. The target asset allocation for equity is 75 % of the pension plan&#8217;s assets. Fixed income investments must consist predominantly of securities rated investment grade or higher. Equity investments must be in liquid securities listed on national exchanges. No investment is permitted in our securities (except through commingled pension trust funds). \n\n&#160; \n\nOur pension plan&#8217;s weighted-average asset allocations, by asset category, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Domestic equity securities 53 &#160; % 52 &#160; % Debt securities 26 &#160; % 24 &#160; % International equity securities 20 &#160; % 23 &#160; % Cash and cash equivalents 1 &#160; % 1 &#160; % Total 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe other postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable life insurance policies with an asset allocation at December 31, 2022 of 64 % in equity securities and 36 % in debt securities compared with 65 % in equity securities and 35 % in debt securities at December 31, 2021. The target asset allocation for equity is between 50 % and 75 % of the plan&#8217;s assets. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe plans&#8217; assumed future returns are based principally on the asset allocations and historical returns for the plans&#8217; asset classes determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, expected market returns for those asset classes. For 2023, we assume an 8.00 % return on pension plan assets. \n\nK62 \n\nFair Value of Plan Assets \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value. \n\n&#160; \n\nCommon stock: Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the official closing price as defined by the exchange or at the most recent trade price of the security at the close of the active market. \n\n&#160; \n\nCommon collective trusts: The readily determinable fair value is based on the published fair value per unit of the trusts. The common collective trusts hold equity securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents. \n\n&#160; \n\nFixed income securities: Valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security at year end using observable market-based inputs. \n\nCommingled funds: The readily determinable fair value is based on the published fair value per unit of the funds. The commingled funds hold equity securities. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash and cash equivalents: Short-term Treasury bills or notes are valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security at year end using observable market-based inputs; money market funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the funds are traded. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table sets forth the pension plan&#8217;s assets by valuation technique level, within the fair value hierarchy. There were no level 3 valued assets at December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 &#160; Level 1 Level 2 Total &#160; ($ in millions) Common stock $ 1,011 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,011 &#160; Common collective trusts: &#160; &#160; &#160; International equity securities &#8212; &#160; 336 &#160; 336 &#160; Debt securities &#8212; &#160; 291 &#160; 291 &#160; Domestic equity securities &#8212; &#160; 160 &#160; 160 &#160; Fixed income securities: Government and agencies securities &#8212; &#160; 158 &#160; 158 &#160; Corporate bonds &#8212; &#160; 100 &#160; 100 &#160; Mortgage and other asset-backed securities &#8212; &#160; 28 &#160; 28 &#160; Commingled funds &#8212; &#160; 121 &#160; 121 &#160; Cash and cash equivalents 55 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 55 &#160; Total investments $ 1,066 &#160; $ 1,194 &#160; $ 2,260 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nK63 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2021 &#160; Level 1 Level 2 Total &#160; ($ in millions) Common stock $ 1,383 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,383 &#160; Common collective trusts: &#160; &#160; &#160; International equity securities &#8212; &#160; 397 &#160; 397 &#160; Debt securities &#8212; &#160; 367 &#160; 367 &#160; Domestic equity securities &#8212; &#160; 189 &#160; 189 &#160; Fixed income securities: Government and agencies securities &#8212; &#160; 170 &#160; 170 &#160; Corporate bonds &#8212; &#160; 120 &#160; 120 &#160; Mortgage and other asset-backed securities &#8212; &#160; 33 &#160; 33 &#160; Commingled funds &#8212; &#160; 160 &#160; 160 &#160; Cash and cash equivalents 42 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 42 &#160; Total investments $ 1,425 &#160; $ 1,436 &#160; $ 2,861 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for other postretirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value. \n\n&#160; \n\nTrust-owned life insurance: Valued at our interest in trust-owned life insurance issued by a major insurance company. The underlying investments owned by the insurance company consist of a U.S. stock account and a U.S. bond account but may retain cash at times as well. The U.S. stock account and U.S. bond account are valued based on readily determinable fair values. \n\nThe other postretirement benefit plan assets consisted of trust-owned life insurance with fair values of $ 122 million and $ 173 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are valued under level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no level 1 or level 3 valued assets. \n\n&#160; \n\nContributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2023, we expect to contribute approximately $ 20 million to our unfunded pension plans for payments to pensioners and approximately $ 33 million to our other postretirement benefit plans for retiree health and death benefits. We do not expect to contribute to our funded pension plan in 2023. \n\nK64 \n\nBenefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits Other \n\nPostretirement &#160; \n\nBenefits \n\n&#160; ($ in millions) 2023 $ 148 &#160; $ 33 &#160; 2024 148 &#160; 32 &#160; 2025 147 &#160; 31 &#160; 2026 147 &#160; 30 &#160; 2027 147 &#160; 29 &#160; Years 2028 &#8211; 2032 736 &#160; 135 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nOther Postretirement Coverage \n\n&#160; \n\nUnder collective bargaining agreements, Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible craft employees. Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and totaled $ 13 million in 2022, $ 21 million in 2021, and $ 22 million in 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\nSection 401(k) Plans \n\n&#160; \n\nNorfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for employees. Under the plans, we match a portion of employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations. Our matching contributions, recorded as an expense, totaled $ 22 million in 2022, $ 23 million in 2021, and $ 21 million in 2020. \n\n13. Stock-Based Compensation \n\n&#160; \n\nUnder the stockholder-approved LTIP, the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee (Committee), which is made up of nonemployee members of the Board, or the Chief Executive Officer (when delegated authority by such Committee), may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted shares, performance share units (PSUs), and performance shares, up to a maximum of 104,125,000 shares of our Common Stock, of which 8,238,993 remain available for future grants as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe number of shares remaining for issuance under the LTIP is reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as a stock option or stock-settled SAR, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than a stock option or stock-settled SAR. Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the Committee may grant stock options up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock. We use newly issued shares to satisfy any exercises and awards under the LTIP and the TSOP. \n\nThe LTIP also permits the payment, on a current or a deferred basis and in cash or in stock, of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered by stock options, RSUs, or PSUs in an amount commensurate with regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock. With respect to stock options, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason, including retirement, disability, or death, we have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments. Regarding RSUs, we have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments unless employment of the participant is terminated as a result of qualifying retirement or disability. Should an employee terminate employment, they are not required to forfeit dividend equivalent payments already received. Outstanding PSUs do not receive dividend equivalent payments. \n\n&#160; \n\nK65 \n\nThe Committee granted stock options, RSUs and PSUs pursuant to the LTIP for the last three years as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Granted Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Granted Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Granted Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Stock options 140,080 $ 61.32 &#160; 42,770 $ 62.49 &#160; 43,770 $ 52.05 &#160; RSUs 180,306 265.21 &#160; 183,093 240.09 &#160; 178,190 210.11 &#160; PSUs 58,945 272.22 &#160; 50,100 240.72 &#160; 78,830 212.66 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRecipients of certain RSUs and PSUs pursuant to the LTIP who retire prior to October 1st will forfeit awards received in the current year. Receipt of certain LTIP awards is contingent on the recipient having executed a non-compete agreement with the company. \n\nWe account for our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs, and dividend equivalent payments in accordance with FASB ASC 718, &#8220; Compensation - Stock Compensation .&#8221; Accordingly, all awards result in charges to net income while dividend equivalent payments, which are all related to equity classified awards, are charged to retained income. Compensation cost for the awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Related compensation costs and tax benefits during the years were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; ($ in millions) Stock-based compensation expense $ 53 &#160; $ 54 &#160; $ 28 &#160; Total tax benefit 27 &#160; 34 &#160; 44 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nStock Options \n\n&#160; \n\nOption exercise prices will be at least the higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the grant date, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the grant date. All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year , and the term of the option will not exceed ten years . Holders of the options granted under the LTIP who remain actively employed receive cash dividend equivalent payments for four years in an amount equal to the regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock. \n\nFor all years, options granted under the LTIP and the TSOP may not be exercised prior to the fourth and third anniversaries of the date of grant, respectively, or if the optionee retires or dies before that anniversary date, may not be exercised before the later of one year after the grant date or the date of the optionee&#8217;s retirement or death. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe fair value of each option awarded was measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on, and historical volatility of, Common Stock. Historical data is used to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Historical exercise data is used to estimate the average expected option term. The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. A dividend yield of zero was used for the LTIP options during the vesting period. For 2022, 2021, and 2020, a dividend yield of 1.85 %, 1.64 %, and 1.76 %, respectively, was used for the vested period during the remaining expected option term for LTIP options. \n\nK66 \n\nThe assumptions for the LTIP grants for the last three years are shown in the following table: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Average expected volatility 27 &#160; % 26 &#160; % 22 &#160; % Average risk-free interest rate 1.80 &#160; % 0.75 &#160; % 1.47 &#160; % Average expected option term 6.5 years 7.5 years 7.5 years ##TABLE_END\n\nA summary of changes in stock options is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START Stock Options Weighted- Average \n\nExercise Price &#160; \n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 1,095,895 &#160; $ 106.58 &#160; Granted 140,080 &#160; 287.31 &#160; Exercised ( 307,660 ) 82.72 &#160; Forfeited ( 48,313 ) 270.92 &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2022 880,002 &#160; 134.66 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $ 103 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 4.1 years.

As of December 31, 2022, $ 7.5 billion remains authorized for repurchase. Our previous share repurchase program terminated on March 31, 2022. \n\n16. Earnings Per Share \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; Basic Diluted &#160; 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 &#160; ($ in millions except per share amounts, shares in millions) Net income $ 3,270 &#160; $ 3,005 &#160; $ 2,013 &#160; $ 3,270 &#160; $ 3,005 &#160; $ 2,013 &#160; Dividend equivalent payments ( 2 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) Income available to common stockholders $ 3,268 &#160; $ 3,003 &#160; $ 2,010 &#160; $ 3,269 &#160; $ 3,005 &#160; $ 2,011 &#160; Weighted-average shares outstanding 234.8 &#160; 246.9 &#160; 255.1 &#160; 234.8 &#160; 246.9 &#160; 255.1 &#160; Dilutive effect of outstanding options &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; and share-settled awards &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.8 &#160; 1.2 &#160; 1.5 &#160; Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding &#160; &#160; &#160; 235.6 &#160; 248.1 &#160; 256.6 &#160; Earnings per share $ 13.92 &#160; $ 12.16 &#160; $ 7.88 &#160; $ 13.88 &#160; $ 12.11 &#160; $ 7.84 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn each year, dividend equivalent payments were made to certain holders of stock options and RSUs. For purposes of computing basic earnings per share, dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and RSUs were deducted from net income to determine income available to common stockholders. For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, we evaluate on a grant-by-grant basis those stock options and RSUs receiving dividend equivalent payments under the two-class and treasury stock methods to determine which method is more dilutive for each grant. For those grants for which the two-class method was more dilutive, net income was reduced by dividend equivalent payments to determine income available to common stockholders. The dilution calculations exclude options having exercise prices exceeding the average market price of Common Stock as follows: 0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and none in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\n17. Commitments and Contingencies \n\n&#160; \n\nLawsuits \n\n&#160; \n\nWe and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations. When we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings and, if material, disclosed below. While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in our opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims. However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter. Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become known. For lawsuits and other claims where a loss may be reasonably possible, but not probable, or is probable but not reasonably estimable, no accrual is established but the matter, if potentially material, is disclosed below. We routinely review relevant information with respect to our lawsuits and other claims and update our accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible loss based on such reviews. \n\nK72 \n\nIn 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against us and other Class I railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. In 2012, the court certified the case as a class action. The defendant railroads appealed this certification, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the District Court&#8217;s decision and remanded the case for further consideration. On October 10, 2017, the District Court denied class certification. The decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals on August 16, 2019. Since that decision, various individual cases have been filed in multiple jurisdictions and also consolidated in the District of Columbia. We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases. We do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. \n\nIn 2018, a lawsuit was filed against one of our subsidiaries by the minority owner in a jointly-owned terminal railroad company in which our subsidiary has the majority ownership. The lawsuit alleged violations of various state laws and federal antitrust laws. On January 3, 2023, the court granted summary judgment to us on all of the compensatory claims but denied summary judgment for all equitable relief claims. On January 18, 2023, the court dismissed the federal equitable relief claims, leaving the state equitable relief claims as the sole remaining issue under consideration. We expect the rulings will be appealed. A trial on the state equitable relief claims has not been scheduled. We continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit and, although it is reasonably possible we could incur a loss in the case, we believe that we will prevail. However, given that litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to uncertainties, there can be no assurances that the final outcome of the litigation (including any related appeal) will not be material. Until such appeal is final, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss associated with this matter. \n\nCasualty Claims \n\n&#160; \n\nCasualty claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as third-party claims, all exclusive of legal costs. To aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm. Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads. The variability inherent in FELA&#8217;s fault-based tort system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded. While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in our opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims and is supported by the most recent actuarial study. In all cases, we record a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and reasonably estimable. \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployee personal injury claims &#8211; The largest component of claims expense is employee personal injury costs. The independent actuarial firm we engage provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing our employee personal injury liability and estimating personal injury expense. The actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. The actuarial firm uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of liability. We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. The accuracy of our estimate of the liability is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events such as jury decisions, court interpretations, or legislative changes. As a result, actual claim settlements may vary from the estimated liability recorded. \n\nOccupational claims &#8211; Occupational claims include injuries and illnesses alleged to be caused by exposures which occur over time as opposed to injuries or illnesses caused by a specific accident or event. Types of occupational claims commonly seen allege exposure to asbestos and other claimed toxic substances resulting in respiratory diseases or cancer. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been employed in the rail industry for decades. The independent actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims liability based upon our history of claim filings, severity, payments, and other pertinent facts. The liability is dependent upon judgments we make as to the specific case reserves as well as judgments of the actuarial firm in the quarterly studies. Our estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported. This provision is derived by analyzing industry data and projecting our experience. We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. However, it is \n\nK73 \n\npossible that the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments to the recorded liability are reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which such adjustments become known. \n\nThird-party claims &#8211; We record a liability for third-party claims including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries, property damage, and lading damage. The actuarial firm assists us with the calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, except lading damage, based upon our experience including the number and timing of incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims, and legal defenses. We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. Given the inherent uncertainty in regard to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that the actual loss may differ from the estimated liability recorded. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are subject to various jurisdictions&#8217; environmental laws and regulations. We record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Environmental specialists regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures of $ 66 million at December 31, 2022, and $ 49 million at December 31, 2021, of which $ 15 million is classified as a current liability at the end of both 2022 and 2021. At December 31, 2022, the liability represents our estimates of the probable cleanup, investigation, and remediation costs based on available information at 85 known locations and projects compared with 88 locations and projects at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, twenty-two sites accounted for $ 55 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. We anticipate that most of this liability will be paid out over five years ; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. \n\n&#160; \n\nAt eight locations, one or more of our subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. We calculate our estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability. \n\n&#160; \n\nWith respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by us or by the Environmental Protection Agency or comparable state authorities), estimates of our ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites can change over time because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant&#8217;s share of any estimated loss (and that participant&#8217;s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present, and future, is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities we transport, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose special risks that we work diligently to reduce. In addition, several of our subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that we will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. \n\n&#160; \n\nBased on our assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, we believe we have recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which we are aware. Further, we believe that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. \n\nK74 \n\nLabor Agreements \n\nApproximately 80 % of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Pursuant to the RLA, these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the RLA are completed. Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements. We largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers&#8217; Conference Committee. \n\nAfter management and the unions served their formal proposals in November 2019 for changes to the collective bargaining agreements, negotiations began in 2020 following the expiration of the last moratorium. On June 17, 2022, the National Mediation Board notified the parties that all practical methods of ending the dispute had been exhausted without effecting a settlement and that its mediation services had been terminated. Shortly thereafter, President Biden created PEB No. 250, effective July 18, 2022, to investigate the facts of the dispute and make recommendations. The PEB issued its recommendations on August 16, 2022, and the parties engaged in further negotiations. By December 2022, agreements based on the PEB&#8217;s recommendations had either been ratified or enacted through legislative action for all twelve unions. For 2022, &#8220;Compensation and benefits&#8221; includes $ 54 million and &#8220;Purchased services and rents&#8221; includes $ 2 million of additional expenses pertaining to wages earned prior to January 1, 2022. \n\nWhile the parties are engaged in additional discussions to conclude the implementation of the recently finalized agreements, neither party can compel mandatory bargaining around any new proposals until November 1, 2024. That said, we understand the imperative to continue improving quality of life for our craft employees and are actively engaged in voluntary discussions (which carry no risk of a work stoppage) with all of our unions on this important issue. \n\nInsurance \n\n&#160; \n\nWe purchase insurance covering legal liabilities for bodily injury and property damage to third parties. This insurance provides coverage above $ 75 million and below $ 800 million ($ 1.1 billion for specific perils) per occurrence and/or policy year. In addition, we purchase insurance covering damage to property owned by us or in our care, custody, or control. This insurance covers approximately 82 % of potential losses above $ 75 million and below $ 275 million per occurrence and/or policy year. \n\nPurchase Commitments \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had outstanding purchase commitments totaling $ 1.7 billion through 2030 for locomotive modernizations, long-term technology support and development contracts, track material, and intermodal equipment. \n\nAsset Purchase and Sale Agreement \n\nIn November 2022, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Cincinnati Southern Railway to purchase approximately 337 miles of railway line that extends from Cincinnati, Ohio to Chattanooga, Tennessee which we currently operate under a lease agreement. The total purchase price for the line and other associated real and personal property included in the transaction is approximately $ 1.6 billion. The agreement is conditioned upon (i) certain changes to Ohio state law applicable to the use of the related sale proceeds, (ii) approval by the voters of the City of Cincinnati, and (iii) the receipt of regulatory approval from the STB. The agreement includes various termination provisions including termination at any time prior to closing by the mutual written consent of the parties, termination at any time after December 31, 2024 by the mutual written consent of the parties, termination by us if the STB takes action that we deem unsatisfactory, and termination by either party if Cincinnati voter approval is not obtained on or before the later of June 30, 2025 and the calendar date on which the polls are open for the 2025 Cincinnati primary election. \n\nK75 \n\nChange-In-Control Arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have compensation agreements with certain officers and key employees that become operative only upon a change in control of Norfolk Southern, as defined in those agreements. The agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the time of a covered individual&#8217;s involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other benefits. \n\nIndemnifications \n\nIn a number of instances, we have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their loans. Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such lenders. The nature and timing of changes in laws or regulations applicable to our financings are inherently unpredictable, and therefore our exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot be quantified. No liability has been recorded related to these indemnifications. \n\nK76 \n\n"

Controls and Procedures \n\n&#160; \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of management, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) at December 31, 2022. Based on such evaluation, our officers have concluded that, at December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record, process, summarize, and report reliable financial data. We recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is comprised of outside directors who are independent of management. The independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have issued a report of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. These reports appear in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we have not identified any changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n&#160; \n\n"

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters \n\n&#160; \n\nIn accordance with General Instruction G(3), information on security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management called for by Part III, Item 12, is incorporated herein by reference from the information appearing under the caption &#8220;Beneficial Ownership of Stock&#8221; in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which definitive Proxy Statement will be filed electronically with the SEC pursuant to Regulation 14A. \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity Compensation Plan Information (at December 31, 2022) \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START Plan Category Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights Weighted- average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights Number of securities \n\nremaining available \n\nfor future issuance \n\nunder equity \n\ncompensation plans (1) \n\n&#160; (a) (b) (c) Equity compensation plans &#160; &#160; &#160; approved by securities holders (2) \n\n1,476,081 \n\n(3) \n\n$ 143.28 \n\n(5) \n\n8,238,993 Equity compensation plans not approved by securities holders 150,015 \n\n(4) \n\n92.72 436,402 \n\n(6) \n\nTotal 1,626,096 &#160; 8,675,395 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n(1) Excludes securities reflected in column (a). \n\n(2) LTIP. \n\n(3) Includes options, RSUs and PSUs granted under LTIP that will be settled in shares of Common Stock. \n\n(4) TSOP. \n\n(5) Calculated without regard to 746,094 outstanding RSUs and PSUs at December 31, 2022. \n\n(6) Reflects shares remaining available for grant under TSOP. \n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan \n\n&#160; \n\nEstablished on June 28, 1983, and approved by our stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984, LTIP was adopted to promote the success of our company by providing an opportunity for non-employee Directors, officers, and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in Norfolk Southern Corporation (the Corporation). The Board of Directors amended LTIP on January 23, 2015, which amendment was approved by shareholders on May 14, 2015, to include the reservation for issuance of an additional 8,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe amended LTIP adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that, for awards granted after May 13, 2010, the number of shares remaining for issuance under the amended LTIP will be reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as an option or stock-settled SAR, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than an option or stock-settled SAR. Any shares of Common Stock subject to options, PSUs, restricted shares, or RSUs which are not issued as Common Stock will again be available for award under LTIP after the expiration or forfeiture of an award. \n\n&#160; \n\nK79 \n\nNon-employee Directors, officers, and other key employees residing in the U.S. or Canada are eligible for selection to receive LTIP awards. Under LTIP, the Committee, or the Corporation&#8217;s chief executive officer to the extent the Committee delegates award-making authority pursuant to LTIP, may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSUs, restricted shares, PSUs and performance shares. In addition, dividend equivalent payments may be awarded for options, RSUs and PSUs. Awards under LTIP may be made subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and the Committee may establish such other terms and conditions for the awards as provided in LTIP. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe option price is at least the higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of grant, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the grant. All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years. LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except that adjustments may be made in the event of changes in our capital structure or Common Stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nPSUs entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a three-year cycle based on our performance during that period. For the 2022 PSU awards, corporate performance will be based directly on return on average capital invested, with total return to stockholders serving as a modifier, and will be settled in shares of Common Stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nRSUs are payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock at the end of a restriction period. During the restriction period, the holder of the RSUs has no beneficial ownership interest in the Common Stock represented by the RSUs and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent payment rights that may be awarded with respect to the RSUs). The Committee at its discretion may waive the restriction period, but settlement of any RSUs will occur on the same settlement date as would have applied absent a waiver of restrictions, if no performance goals were imposed. RSUs will be settled in shares of Common Stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Board of Directors adopted TSOP on January 26, 1999, to promote the success of our company by providing an opportunity for management employees to acquire a proprietary interest in our company and thereby to provide an additional incentive to management employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity of our company and our stockholders. Under TSOP there were 6,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for issuance. TSOP has not been and is not required to have been approved by our stockholders. \n\n&#160; \n\nActive full-time management employees residing in the U.S. or Canada are eligible for selection to receive TSOP awards. Under TSOP, the Committee, or the Corporation&#8217;s chief executive officer to the extent the Committee delegates award-making authority pursuant to TSOP, may grant nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and conditions as provided in TSOP. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe option price may not be less than the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of the grant. All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years. TSOP specifically prohibits repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments. \n\n&#160; \n\nK80 \n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation Directors&#8217; Restricted Stock Plan \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Plan was adopted on January 1, 1994, and was designed to increase ownership of Common Stock by our non-employee Directors so as to further align their ownership interest in our company with that of our stockholders. The Plan has not been and is not required to have been approved by our stockholders. \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective January 23, 2015, the Board amended the Plan to provide that no additional awards will be made under the Plan. Prior to that amendment, only non-employee Directors who are not and never have been employees of our company were eligible to participate in the Plan. Upon becoming a Director, each eligible Director received a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Common Stock. No additional shares may be granted under the Plan. No individual member of the Board exercised discretion concerning the eligibility of any Director or the number of shares granted. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient&#8217;s death or the day after the recipient ceases to be a Director by reason of disability or retirement. During the restriction period, shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise encumbered. Directors forfeit the restricted shares if they cease to serve as a Director of our company for reasons other than their disability, retirement, or death. \n\n&#160; \n\n"
