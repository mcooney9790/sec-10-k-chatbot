BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES \n\nOverview \n\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. This basin, which is one of the major producing basins in the United States, is characterized by an extensive production history, a favorable operating environment, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons, enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators. We report operations in one reportable segment, the upstream segment. Prior to the Rattler Merger (as defined below), both the upstream operations segment and the midstream operations segment were considered separate reportable segments. Following the Rattler Merger, the Company determined only the upstream operations segment met the quantitative requirements of a reportable segment. \n\nOur activities are primarily focused on horizontal development of the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formations of the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations of the Delaware Basin, both of which are part of the larger Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico. These formations are characterized by a high concentration of oil and liquids rich natural gas, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons, extensive production history, long-lived reserves and high drilling success rates. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, our total acreage position in the Permian Basin was approximately 615,348 gross (508,767 net) acres, which consisted primarily of 371,915 gross (325,540 net) acres in the Midland Basin and 201,624 gross (150,719 net) acres in the Delaware Basin. \n\nIn addition, our publicly traded subsidiary Viper Energy Partners LP, which we refer to as Viper, owns mineral interests in the Permian Basin. We own Viper&#8217;s General Partner, and we own approximately 56% of the limited partner interests in Viper. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 2,032,971 MBOE (which includes estimated reserves of 148,900 MBOE attributable to the mineral interests owned by Viper). Of these reserves, approximately 69% are classified as proved developed producing. Proved undeveloped, or PUD, reserves included in this estimate are from 703 gross (650 net) horizontal well locations in which we have a working interest, and 15 horizontal wells in which we own only a mineral interest through Viper. As of December 31, 2022, our estimated proved reserves were approximately 53% oil, 23% natural gas and 24% natural gas liquids. \n\nSignificant Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures \n\nPending Non-Core Asset Divestiture \n\nIn February 2023, we entered into definitive sales agreements with unrelated third-party buyers to divest non-core assets consisting of approximately 19,000 net acres in Glasscock County and approximately 4,900 net acres in Ward and Winkler counties for combined total consideration of $439 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. Both of these transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to completion of diligence and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions \n\nLario Acquisition \n\nOn January 31, 2023, we closed on our acquisition of all leasehold interests and related assets of Lario Permian, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lario Oil and Gas Company, and certain associated sellers (collectively &#8220;Lario&#8221;). The acquisition included approximately 25,000 gross (15,000 net) acres in the Midland Basin and certain related oil and gas assets (the &#8220;Lario Acquisition&#8221;), in exchange for 4.33 million shares of our common stock and $814 million in cash, including certain customary closing adjustments. The Lario Acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination in the first quarter of 2023, with the fair value of consideration allocated to the acquisition date fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nFireBird Acquisition \n\nOn November 30, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of all leasehold interests and related assets of FireBird Energy LLC (the &#8220;FireBird Acquisition&#8221;), which included approximately 75,000 gross (68,000 net) acres in the Midland Basin and certain related oil and gas assets, in exchange for 5.92 million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock and $787 million of cash including customary closing adjustments. \n\nRattler Merger \n\nOn August 24, 2022 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;), we completed the merger with Rattler pursuant to which we acquired all of the approximately 38.51 million publicly held outstanding common units of Rattler in exchange for approximately 4.35 million shares of our common stock (the &#8220;Rattler Merger&#8221;). Rattler continued as the surviving entity, and is now our wholly-owned subsidiary. Following the Rattler Merger, we owned all of Rattler&#8217;s outstanding common units and Class B units, and Rattler GP remained the general partner of Rattler. Following the closing of the Rattler Merger, Rattler&#8217;s common units were delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and Rattler filed a certification on Form 15 with the SEC requesting the deregistration of its common units and suspension of Rattler&#8217;s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. \n\nSee Note 4&#8212; Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 16&#8212; Subsequent Events included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures during 2022. \n\nCommodity Prices \n\nPrices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future, extreme weather conditions and other substantially variable factors, influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. The war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising interest rates, global supply chain disruptions, concerns about a potential economic downturn or recession and recent measures to combat persistent inflation have continued to contribute to economic and pricing volatility during 2022. Although the impact of inflation on our business has been insignificant in prior periods, inflation in the U.S. has been rising at its fastest rate in over 40 years, creating inflationary pressure on the cost of services, equipment and other goods in the energy industry and other sectors, which is contributing to labor and materials shortages across the supply-chain. Additionally, OPEC and its non-OPEC allies, known collectively as OPEC+, continues to meet regularly to evaluate the state of global oil supply, demand and inventory levels. As such, pricing may remain volatile during 2023. \n\nDespite continuing favorable commodity prices and rising demand, we kept our production relatively flat during 2022, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program. \n\nOur Business Strategy \n\nOur business strategy includes the following: \n\n&#8226; Exercise Capital Discipline. During 2022, we continued building on our execution track record, generating free cash flow while keeping capital costs under control. Our efficiency gains, particularly in the Midland Basin drilling and completion programs, enabled us to mitigate certain inflationary pressures on variable well costs, which led to a total capital expenditure amount of $1.9 billion, consistent with our guidance presented in November of 2022. We expect to continue to exercise capital discipline and plan to spend between $2.50 billion and $2.70 billion in 2023, with the goal of maintaining flat oil production throughout the year. This capital range accounts for the inflationary pressures we expect to see in 2023. \n\n&#8226; Focus on low cost development strategy and continuous improvement in operational, capital allocation and cost efficiencies. Our acreage position is generally in contiguous blocks which allows us to develop this acreage efficiently with a &#8220;manufacturing&#8221; strategy that takes advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities. We are the operator of approximately 98% of our acreage, which allows us to efficiently manage our operating costs, pace of development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production. Our average 83% working interest in our acreage allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these activities and cost efficiencies. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; Continue to deliver on our enhanced capital return program. We expect to be in a position to continue to deliver on our enhanced capital return program, through which we intend to distribute 75% of our quarterly free cash flow to our stockholders. Our capital return program is currently focused on our sustainable and growing base dividend and a combination of stock repurchases and variable dividends. \n\n&#8226; Leverage our experience operating in the Permian Basin. Our executive team, which has significant experience in the Permian Basin, intends to continue to seek ways to maximize hydrocarbon recovery by optimizing and enhancing our drilling and completion techniques. Our focus on efficient drilling and completion techniques is an important part of the continuous drilling program we have planned for our significant inventory of identified potential drilling locations. We believe that the experience of our executive team in deviated and horizontal drilling and completions has helped reduce the execution risk normally associated with these complex well paths. In addition, our completion techniques are continually evolving as we evaluate and implement hydraulic fracturing practices that have and are expected to continue to increase recovery and reduce completion costs. Our executive team regularly evaluates our operating results against those of other top operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance and adopt best practices compared to our peers. \n\n&#8226; Pursue strategic acquisitions with substantial resource potential. We have a proven history of acquiring leasehold positions in the Permian Basin that have substantial oil-weighted resource potential. We believe our executive team, with its extensive experience in the Permian Basin, has a competitive advantage in identifying acquisition targets and a proven ability to evaluate resource potential. We regularly review acquisition opportunities and intend to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets. \n\n&#8226; Maintain financial flexibility. We seek to maintain a conservative financial position. As of December 31, 2022, Diamondback had $139 million of standalone cash and cash equivalents and our borrowing base was set at $1.6 billion which was fully available for future borrowings. As of December 31, 2022, Viper LLC had $18 million of cash and cash equivalents, $152 million in outstanding borrowings and $348 million available for future borrowings under its revolving credit facility. \n\n&#8226; Deliver on our commitment to environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) performance . We are committed to the safe and responsible development of our resources in the Permian Basin. Our approach to ESG is evidenced through our commitment to people, safety, environmental responsibility, community and sound governance practices. In September 2022, we announced our medium-term goal to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) intensity by at least 50%, from 2020 levels by 2030 and a short-term goal to implement continuous emission monitoring systems on our facilities to cover at least 90% of operated oil production by the end of 2023. \n\nOur Strengths \n\nWe believe the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals: \n\n&#8226; Oil rich resource base in one of North America&#8217;s leading resource plays. Substantially all of our leasehold acreage is located in one of the most prolific oil plays in North America, the Permian Basin in West Texas. The majority of our current properties are well positioned in the core of the Permian Basin. Our production for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 58% oil, 21% natural gas liquids and 21% natural gas. As of December 31, 2022, our estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately 53% oil, 23% natural gas and 24% natural gas liquids. \n\n&#8226; Multi-year drilling inventory in one of North America&#8217;s leading oil resource plays. We have identified a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations for our oil-weighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and return opportunities. At an assumed economic price of approximately $50.00 per Bbl WTI, we currently have approximately 8,276 gross (6,055 net) identified potential horizontal drilling locations on our acreage, based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data. These gross identified economic potential horizontal locations have an average lateral length of approximately 9,234 feet, with the actual length depending on lease geometry and other considerations. These locations exist across most of our acreage blocks and in multiple horizons. The ultimate inter-well spacing at these locations may vary due to different factors, which would result in a higher or lower location count. In addition, we have approximately 5,383 square miles of proprietary 3-D seismic data covering our acreage. This data facilitates the evaluation of our existing drilling inventory and provides insight into future development activity, including additional horizontal drilling opportunities and strategic leasehold acquisitions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; Experienced, incentivized and proven management team. Our executive team has a proven track record of executing on multi-rig development drilling programs and extensive experience in the Permian Basin. Our executive team has significant experience with both drilling and completing horizontal wells in addition to horizontal well reservoir and geologic expertise, which is of strategic importance as we expand our horizontal drilling activity. \n\n&#8226; Favorable operating environment. We have focused our drilling and development operations in the Permian Basin, one of the longest operating hydrocarbon basins in the United States, with a long and well-established production history and developed infrastructure. We believe that the geological and regulatory environment of the Permian Basin is more stable and predictable, and that we are faced with less operational risks in the Permian Basin, as compared to emerging hydrocarbon basins. \n\n&#8226; High degree of operational control. We are the operator of approximately 98% of our Permian Basin acreage. This operating control allows us to better execute on our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques, completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes. We retain the ability to increase or decrease our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks. This operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of horizontal prospects. \n\nOur Properties \n\nLocation and Land \n\nThe Permian Basin area covers a significant portion of western Texas and eastern New Mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, our total acreage position in the Permian Basin was approximately 615,348 gross (508,767 net) acres, which consisted primarily of 371,915 gross (325,540 net) acres in the Midland Basin and 201,624 gross (150,719 net) acres in the Delaware Basin. In addition, our publicly traded subsidiary Viper owns mineral interests underlying approximately 775,180 gross acres (26,315 net) royalty acres in the Permian Basin. Approximately 57% of these net royalty acres are operated by us. \n\nWe have been developing multiple pay intervals in the Permian Basin through horizontal drilling and believe that there are opportunities to target additional intervals throughout the stratigraphic column. We believe our significant experience drilling, completing and operating horizontal wells will allow us to efficiently develop our remaining inventory and ultimately target other horizons that have limited development to date. The following table presents horizontal producing wells in which we have a working interest as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Basin Number of Horizontal Wells Midland 2,310 Delaware 891 Other 53 Total (1) \n\n3,254 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Of these 3,254 total horizontal producing wells, we are the operator of 2,771 wells and have a non-operated working interest in 483 additional wells. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table presents the average number of days in which we were able to drill our horizontal wells to total depth specified below during the year ended December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Average Days to Total Depth Midland Basin 7,500 foot lateral 7 10,000 foot lateral 12 13,000 foot lateral 15 15,000 foot lateral 16 Delaware Basin 7,500 foot lateral 28 10,000 foot lateral 17 13,000 foot lateral 20 15,000 foot lateral 14 ##TABLE_END\n\nFurther advances in drilling and completion technology may result in economic development of zones that are not currently viable. \n\nMidstream Assets \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we own and operate 770 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines and a fully integrated water system on acreage that overlays our nine core Midland and Delaware Basin development areas. Our crude oil infrastructure assets, which consist of gathering pipelines and metering facilities gather crude oil from horizontal and vertical wells in our ReWard, Spanish Trail, Pecos and Fivestones areas within the Permian Basin. Our water sourcing and distribution assets consist of water wells, frac pits, pipelines and water treatment and recycling facilities, which collectively gather and distribute water from Permian Basin aquifers to our drilling and completion sites through buried pipelines and temporary surface pipelines. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we also owned interests in the following midstream investments: \n\n&#8226; a 10% equity interest in EPIC Crude Holdings LP, which owns and operates a long-haul crude oil pipeline from the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale to Corpus Christi, Texas that is capable of transporting approximately 600,000 Bbl/d. \n\n&#8226; a 10% equity interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC, which owns and operates a long-haul crude oil pipeline that is capable of transporting 900,000 Bbl/d from the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale to points along the Texas Gulf Coast, including a marine terminal connection in Corpus Christi, Texas. The Company subsequently divested its investment in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC in January 2023. \n\n&#8226; a 4% equity interest in Wink to Webster Pipeline LLC, which owns and operates a crude oil pipeline that is capable of transporting approximately 1,000,000 Bbl/d from origin points at Wink and Midland in the Permian Basin for delivery to multiple Houston area locations. \n\n&#8226; a 43% equity interest in OMOG JV LLC, which operates approximately 400 miles of crude oil gathering and regional transportation pipelines and approximately 350,000 barrels of crude oil storage in Midland, Martin, Andrews and Ector Counties, Texas. \n\n&#8226; a 25% equity interest in Remuda Midstream Holdings LLC, which we refer to as the WTG joint venture, which owns and operates an interconnected gas gathering system and seven major gas processing plants servicing the Midland Basin with 1,100 MMcf/d of total processing capacity with additional gas gathering and processing expansions planned. \n\n&#8226; a 10% equity interest in BANGL LLC, which we refer to as the BANGL joint venture. The BANGL pipeline, which began full commercial service in the fourth quarter of 2021, provides NGL takeaway capacity from the MPLX and WTG gas processing plants in the Permian Basin to the NGL fractionation hub in Sweeny, Texas and has expansion capacity of up to 300,000 Bbl/d. \n\nFor additional information regarding our equity method investments as of December 31, 2022, see Note 7&#8212; Equity Method Investments and Note 16&#8212; Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nArea History \n\nOur proved reserves are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, in particular in the Clearfork, Spraberry, Bone Spring, Wolfcamp, Strawn, Atoka and Barnett/Meramec formations. The Spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present, as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central Midland Basin. Development in the Spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells, with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs. \n\nThe Wolfcamp formation is a long-established reservoir in West Texas, first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties. Exploration using 2-D seismic data located additional fields, but it was not until the use of 3-D seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the Wolfcamp formation was revealed. The additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently. \n\nBy mid-2010, approximately half of the rigs active in the Permian Basin were drilling wells in the Permian Spraberry, Dean and Wolfcamp formations, which we collectively refer to as the Wolfberry play. Since then, we and most other operators are almost exclusively drilling horizontal wells in the development of unconventional reservoirs in the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2022, we held working interests in 6,489 gross (5,574 net) producing wells and only royalty interests in 5,455 additional wells. \n\nGeology \n\nThe Greater Permian Basin formed as an area of rapid Pennsylvanian-Permian subsidence in response to dynamic structural influence of the Marathon Uplift and Ancestral Rockies. It is one of the most productive sedimentary basins in the U.S., with established oil and natural gas production from several stacked reservoirs of varying age ranges, most notably Permian aged sediments. In particular, the Permian aged Wolfcamp, Spraberry and Bone Spring Formations have been heavily targeted for several decades. First, through vertical commingling of these zones and, more recently, through horizontal exploitation of each individual horizon. Prior to deposition of the Wolfcamp, Spraberry and Bone Spring Formations, the area of the present-day Permian Basin was a continuous sedimentary feature called the Tabosa Basin. During this time, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian and Mississippian sediments were laid down in a primarily open marine, shelf setting. However, some time frames saw more restrictive settings that lead to deposits of organically rich mudstone such as the Devonian Woodford and Mississippian Barnett/Meramec. These formations are important sources and, more recently, reservoirs within the present-day Greater Permian Basin. \n\nThe Spraberry and Bone Spring Formations were deposited as siliciclastic and carbonate turbidites and debris flows along with pelagic mudstones in a deep-water, basinal environment, while the Wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debris-flow, grain-flow and fine-grained pelagic sediments, which were also deposited in a basinal setting. The best carbonate reservoirs within the Wolfcamp, Spraberry and Bone Spring are generally found in close proximity to the Central Basin Platform, while mudstone reservoirs thicken basin-ward, away from the Central Basin Platform. The mudstone within these reservoirs is organically rich, which when buried to sufficient depth for thermal maturation, became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the mudstones themselves and in the interbedded conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs. Due to this complexity, the Wolfcamp, Spraberry and Bone Spring intervals are a hybrid reservoir system that contains characteristics of both unconventional and conventional reservoirs. \n\nWe have successfully developed several hybrid reservoir intervals within the Clearfork, Spraberry/Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and Barnett/Meramec formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012. The mudstones and some clastics exhibit low permeabilities which necessitate the need for hydraulic fracture stimulation to unlock the vast storage of hydrocarbons in these targets. \n\nWe possess, or are in the process of acquiring, 3-D seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas. Our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 5,383 square miles of 3-D data. This data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling program and identification of additional resources to be exploited. \n\n&#160; \n\nRecent and Future Activity \n\nDuring 2023, we expect to drill an estimated 325 to 345 gross (293 to 311 net) operated horizontal wells and complete an estimated 330 to 350 gross (297 to 315 net) operated horizontal wells on our acreage. We currently estimate that our capital expenditures in 2023 will be between $2.50 billion and $2.70 billion, consisting of $2.25 billion to $2.41 billion for horizontal drilling and completions including non-operated activity and capital workovers, $170 million to $190 million \n\nTable of Contents \n\nfor infrastructure and environmental and $80 million to $100 million for midstream investments, excluding joint venture investments and the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we drilled 240 gross (223 net) and completed 255 gross (236 net) operated horizontal wells. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our capital expenditures for drilling, completing and equipping wells and infrastructure additions to oil and natural gas properties were $1.9 billion. In addition, we spent $84 million for oil and natural gas midstream assets. \n\nWe were operating 19 drilling rigs and four completion crews at December 31, 2022 and currently intend to operate between 13 and 19 rigs and four and seven completion crews on average in 2023. We will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions. \n\nOil and Natural Gas Data \n\nProved Reserves \n\nEvaluation and Review of Reserves \n\nThe estimated reserves as of December 31, 2022 are based on reserve estimates prepared by our internal reservoir engineers and audited by Ryder Scott, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Our historical reserve estimates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were prepared by Ryder Scott. The internal and external technical persons responsible for preparing or auditing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Ryder Scott is a third-party engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis. The purpose of Ryder Scott&#8217;s audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates for 2022. The proved reserve audit performed by Ryder Scott for 2022 covered 100% of our total proved reserves. \n\nUnder SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a &#8220;high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.&#8221; All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 were estimated using a deterministic method. \n\nThe estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. In general, our proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data. In certain cases where there was inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the estimates was considered to be inappropriate, the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy, or a combination of performance and analogy methods. The analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate. All proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method. \n\nTo estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, we considered many factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used included production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe process of estimating oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves is complex and requires significant judgment, as discussed in &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8221; of this report. As a result, we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals that have an internal control process to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves. Our internal technical staff met with our independent reserve auditor periodically during their audit of the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in our proved reserve estimation process. As part of the audit process, we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest, oil and natural gas production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and development costs. \n\nThe Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all our reserve estimates and overseeing communications with our independent reserve auditor. The Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 19 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 14 years of industry experience per person. Our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest, oil and natural gas production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and development costs. Ryder Scott performed an independent analysis during its audit of our estimated reserves for 2022 and any differences were reviewed with our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering. For 2022, our reserve auditor&#8217;s estimates of our proved reserves did not materially differ from our estimates by more than the established audit tolerance guidelines of ten percent. \n\nThe internal control procedures utilized in the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, and include the following: \n\n&#8226; review and verification of historical production data, which is based on actual production as reported by us; \n\n&#8226; preparation of reserve estimates by the primary reserve engineers or under their direct supervision; \n\n&#8226; review by the primary reserve engineers of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions; \n\n&#8226; review of historical realized commodity prices and differentials from index prices compared to the differentials used in the reserves database; \n\n&#8226; direct reporting responsibilities by our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering to our Executive Vice President&#8212;Operations; \n\n&#8226; prior to finalizing the reserve report, a review of our preliminary proved reserve estimates by our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering and our primary reserves engineers takes place on an annual basis; \n\n&#8226; review of our proved reserve estimates by our Audit Committee with our executive team and Ryder Scott on an annual basis; \n\n&#8226; verification of property ownership by our land department; and \n\n&#8226; no employee&#8217;s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves booked. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (including those attributable to Viper), which were prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. All of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental United States. As of December 31, 2022, none of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed non-producing. \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Estimated Proved Developed Reserves: Oil (MBbls) 699,513 620,474 443,464 Natural gas (MMcf) 2,122,782 1,770,688 1,085,035 Natural gas liquids (MBbls) 350,243 285,513 192,495 Total (MBOE) 1,403,553 1,201,102 816,798 Estimated Proved Undeveloped Reserves: Oil (MBbls) 369,995 307,815 315,937 Natural gas (MMcf) 746,079 815,119 522,029 Natural gas liquids (MBbls) 135,076 144,221 96,701 Total (MBOE) 629,418 587,889 499,643 Estimated Net Proved Reserves: Oil (MBbls) 1,069,508 928,289 759,401 Natural gas (MMcf) 2,868,861 2,585,807 1,607,064 Natural gas liquids (MBbls) 485,319 429,734 289,196 \n\nTotal (MBOE) (1) \n\n2,032,971 1,788,991 1,316,441 Percent proved developed 69% 67% 62% ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in accordance with SEC guidelines. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties, all of which are located within the continental United States. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates. See &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8221; for a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with our estimates of proved reserves and related factors, and see Note 18&#8212; Supplemental Information on Oil and Natural Gas Operations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our reserve estimates and pricing. \n\nProved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs) \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 369,995 MBbls of oil, 746,079 MMcf of natural gas and 135,076 MBbls of natural gas liquids, for a total of 629,418 MBOE. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production. \n\nThe following table includes the changes in PUD reserves for 2022 (MBOE): \n\n##TABLE_START Beginning proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021 587,889 Undeveloped reserves transferred to developed (155,457) Revisions (82,619) Purchases 8,734 Divestitures (93) Extensions and discoveries 270,964 Ending proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2022 629,418 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of 256,007 MBOE from 311 gross (287 net) wells in which we have a working interest and 14,957 MBOE from 199 gross wells in which Viper owns royalty interests. Of the 311 gross working interest wells, 261 were in the Midland Basin and 50 were in the Delaware Basin. Transfers of 155,457 MBOE from undeveloped to developed reserves were the result of drilling or participating in 168 gross (155 net) horizontal wells in which we have a working interest and 115 gross wells in which we also have a royalty interest or mineral interest through Viper. Downward revisions of 82,619 MBOE were primarily the result of negative revisions of 94,880 MBOE due to downgrades related to changes in the corporate development plan, and positive revisions of 12,261 \n\nTable of Contents \n\nMBOE attributable to higher commodity prices. Purchases of 8,734 MBOE consisted of 8,367 MBOE primarily from the FireBird Acquisition, and 367 MBOE of Viper&#8217;s royalty interest purchases. \n\nCosts incurred relating to the development of PUDs were approximately $566 million during 2022. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs are projected to be approximately $1.4 billion in 2023, $1.4 billion in 2024, $882 million in 2025 and $659 million in 2026. Since our formation in 2011, our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced, and we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert PUDs into proved developed reserves in upcoming years. \n\nWe have identified a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations for our oil-weighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and return opportunities. At an assumed price of approximately $50.00 per Bbl WTI, we currently have approximately 8,276 gross (6,055 net) identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations on our acreage based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data. With our current development plan, we expect to continue our strong PUD conversion ratio in 2023 by converting an estimated 33% of our PUDs to a proved developed category and developing approximately 80% of the consolidated 2022 year-end PUD reserves by the end of 2025. As of December 31, 2022, all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded. \n\nThe following table presents the number of gross identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations by basin: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Identified Economic Potential Horizontal Drilling Locations Midland Basin Lower Spraberry (1) \n\n1,100 Middle Spraberry (1) \n\n924 Wolfcamp A (2) \n\n665 Wolfcamp B (2) \n\n793 Other 1,772 Total Midland Basin 5,254 Delaware Basin 2nd Bone Springs (3) \n\n652 3rd Bone Springs (3) \n\n963 Wolfcamp A (3) \n\n359 Wolfcamp B (3) \n\n585 Other 463 Total Delaware Basin 3,022 Total 8,276 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Our current location count is based on 660 foot to 880 foot spacing in Midland, Martin and northeast Andrews counties, depending on the prospect area and 880 foot spacing in all other counties. \n\n(2) Our current location count is based on 660 foot to 880 foot spacing in Midland and Howard counties, depending on the prospect area and 880 foot spacing in all other counties. \n\n(3) Our current location count is based on 880 foot to 1,320 foot spacing. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOil and Natural Gas Production Prices and Production Costs \n\nProduction and Price History \n\nThe following tables set forth information regarding our net production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids by basin for each of the periods indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START Midland Basin Delaware Basin Other (1) \n\nTotal Production Data: Year Ended December 31, 2022 Oil (MBbls) 58,803 22,681 132 81,616 Natural gas (MMcf) 116,579 59,338 459 176,376 Natural gas liquids (MBbls) 20,800 9,016 64 29,880 Total (MBOE) 99,033 41,587 273 140,892 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Oil (MBbls) 52,112 25,672 3,738 81,522 Natural gas (MMcf) 96,083 66,034 7,289 169,406 Natural gas liquids (MBbls) 17,010 8,749 1,487 27,246 Total (MBOE) 85,136 45,427 6,440 137,002 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Oil (MBbls) 38,313 27,703 166 66,182 Natural gas (MMcf) 68,529 61,606 414 130,549 Natural gas liquids (MBbls) 12,597 9,295 89 21,981 Total (MBOE) 62,332 47,266 324 109,921 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Production data includes (i) Rockies, (ii) High Plains beginning January 1, 2021, (iii) Eagle Ford Shale through October 1, 2022, the effective date on which the properties were divested and (iv) Central Basin Platform through December 31, 2020. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table sets forth certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Average Prices: Oil ($ per Bbl) $ 93.85 $ 66.19 $ 36.41 Natural gas ($ per Mcf) $ 4.86 $ 3.36 $ 0.82 Natural gas liquids ($ per Bbl) $ 35.07 $ 28.70 $ 10.87 Combined ($ per BOE) $ 67.90 $ 49.25 $ 25.07 Oil, hedged ($ per Bbl) (1) \n\n$ 86.76 $ 52.56 $ 40.34 Natural gas, hedged ($ per Mcf) (1) \n\n$ 4.12 $ 2.39 $ 0.67 Natural gas liquids, hedged ($ per Bbl) (1) \n\n$ 35.07 $ 28.33 $ 10.83 Average price, hedged ($ per BOE) (1) \n\n$ 62.85 $ 39.87 $ 27.26 Average Costs per BOE: Lease operating expenses $ 4.63 $ 4.12 $ 3.87 Production and ad valorem taxes 4.34 3.10 1.77 Gathering and transportation expense 1.83 1.55 1.27 General and administrative - cash component 0.63 0.69 0.46 Total operating expense - cash $ 11.43 $ 9.46 $ 7.37 General and administrative - non-cash component $ 0.39 $ 0.37 $ 0.34 Depletion 8.87 8.77 11.30 Interest expense, net 1.13 1.45 1.79 Merger and integration expense 0.10 0.57 &#8212; Total expenses $ 10.49 $ 11.16 $ 13.43 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices and include gains and losses on cash settlements for matured commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.

Through our subsidiary Viper, we own an average 3.8% net revenue interest in 8,260 of the total 11,944 gross productive wells. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells. \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding productive wells by basin as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Gross Wells Net Wells Oil Natural Gas Total Oil Natural Gas Total Midland Basin 9,170 32 9,202 4,850 11 4,861 Delaware Basin 2,358 272 2,630 683 27 710 Other 57 55 112 3 &#8212; 3 Total productive wells 11,585 359 11,944 5,536 38 5,574 ##TABLE_END\n\nDrilling Results \n\nThe following tables set forth information with respect to the number of wells drilled during the periods indicated by basin.

To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects impacting the development or operation of a producing property, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects. We have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards \n\nTable of Contents \n\ngenerally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion, an updated title review, or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties. \n\nMarketing and Customers \n\nWe typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. For the year ended December 31, 2022, two purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, four purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. We do not require collateral and do not believe the loss of any single purchaser would materially impact our operating results, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers. For additional information regarding our customer concentrations, see Note 3&#8212; Revenue from Contracts with Customers included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nDelivery Commitments \n\nCertain of our firm sales agreements include delivery commitments that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity of oil. We believe our current production and reserves are sufficient to fulfill these delivery commitments and we expect our reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments. However, these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment. For additional information regarding commitments, see Note 15&#8212; Commitments and Contingencies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and in our upstream segment, we compete with other companies that may have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Further, oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. \n\nOil and Natural Gas Leases \n\nThe typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 15% to 35%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 65% to 85%. \n\nSeasonal Nature of Business \n\nGenerally, demand for oil increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter months while natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Certain natural gas buyers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. In our exploration and production business, seasonal weather conditions, and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRegulation \n\nOil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements. Legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas, and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is often strict (i.e., no showing of &#8220;fault&#8221; is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future. \n\nWaste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or the RCRA, as amended, and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the RCRA, such wastes may constitute &#8220;solid wastes&#8221; that are subject to the less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the U.S. Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as &#8220;hazardous wastes.&#8221; Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and natural gas waste. However, in April 2019, the EPA concluded that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of oil and natural gas waste are not necessary at this time. Any changes in such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. \n\nAdministrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes. \n\nRemediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA or the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and analogous state laws, generally impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or \n\nTable of Contents \n\noperators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; have been released. \n\nWater Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the &#8220;Clean Water Act,&#8221; or the CWA, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, or the OPA, and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. \n\nThe scope of waters regulated under the CWA has fluctuated in recent years. On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or the Corps, jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the CWA. However, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 rules, and then, on April 21, 2020, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule replacing the 2015 rule, and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the CWA. On August 30, 2021, a federal court struck down the replacement rule and, on December 30, 2022, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule that would restore water protections that were in place prior to 2015. Meanwhile, in October 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case addressing the proper test for determining whether wetlands are &#8220;waters of the United States.&#8221; As a result of such recent developments, substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the CWA. To the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the CWA&#8217;s jurisdiction, we or third-party operators could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. \n\nThe EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption &#8220;&#8211;Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.&#8221; Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. \n\nThe OPA is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. \n\nNon-compliance with the CWA or the OPA may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations. We believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws. \n\nAir Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, or the CAA, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal CAA that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which are discussed in more detail below in &#8220;&#8212;Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.&#8221; Also, on May 12, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThese laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal CAA and associated state laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations. Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. \n\nClimate Change. In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, which includes billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration. These incentives could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell and adversely impact our business. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of greenhouse gases through a methane emissions charge. The IRA amends the CAA to impose a fee on the emission of methane that exceeds an applicable waste emissions threshold from sources required to report their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA, including those sources in the offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting source categories. The methane emissions charge would start in calendar year 2024 at $900 per ton of methane, increase to $1,200 in 2025 and be set at $1,500 for 2026 and each year after. Calculation of the fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA. The methane emissions charge could increase our operating costs, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nThe EPA has also finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and almost one-half of the states have taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. In addition, states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of gas during oil and natural gas operations. For example, on November 4, 2020, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new guidance on when flaring is permissible, requiring operators to submit more specific information to justify the need to flare or vent gas. \n\nAt the international level, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake &#8220;ambitious efforts&#8221; to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2021 to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which went into effect on February 19, 2021. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. In November 2021, in connection with the 26th Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, Scotland, the United States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international climate commitments. \n\nRestrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for, price of, and value of our products and reserves. As our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly, current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. \n\nIn addition, there have been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds, by promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding and insurance underwriters to limit coverages to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. \n\nMoreover, climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to \n\nTable of Contents \n\nexperience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions, such as the severe winter storms in the Permian Basin in February 2021, can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. \n\nRegulation of Hydraulic Fracturing \n\nHydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of the U.S. Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of &#8220;underground injection,&#8221; to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as &#8220;Class II&#8221; Underground Injection Control wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act. \n\nOn June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. \n\nOn August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal CAA that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA&#8217;s rule package includes New Source Performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or &#8220;green completions&#8221; on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, on August 13, 2020, in response to an executive order by former President Trump to review and revise unduly burdensome regulations, the EPA amended the 2012 and 2016 New Source Performance standards to ease regulatory burdens, including rescinding standards applicable to transmission or storage segments and eliminating methane requirements altogether. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint resolution of the U.S. Congress disapproving the 2020 amendments (with the exception of some technical changes) thereby reinstating the 2012 and 2016 New Source Performance standards. The EPA expects owners and operators of regulated sources to take &#8220;immediate steps&#8221; to comply with these standards. Additionally, on November 15, 2021, the EPA published a proposed rule that would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry by requiring increased monitoring of fugitive emissions, imposing new requirements for pneumatic controllers and tank batteries, and prohibiting venting of natural gas in certain situations. On December 6, 2022, the EPA published a supplemental proposal to strengthen the emission reduction requirements, which would, among other things, expand leak detection requirements and tighten flaring restrictions. These new standards, to the extent implemented, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty. \n\nFurthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further \n\nTable of Contents \n\nregulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. \n\nSeveral states, including Texas, and local jurisdictions, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. The Texas Legislature adopted legislation, effective September 1, 2011, requiring oil and natural gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the Texas Railroad Commission issues an initial drilling permit after February 1, 2012. The law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of OSHA for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. Also, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the Texas Railroad Commission&#8217;s authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Texas Railroad Commission has used this authority to deny permits and temporarily suspend operations for waste disposal wells. For example, in September 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission curtailed the amount of water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near Midland and Odessa in the Permian Basin, and has subsequently suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. In addition, the Texas Railroad Commission has imposed daily monitoring and reporting requirements for any new disposal well permitted in the Permian Basin. These restrictions on use of produced water, a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells, and additional monitoring and reporting requirements could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or pump it through the pipeline network or other means, all of which could be costly. We or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, or require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells. These factors may make drilling and completion activity in the affected parts of the Permian Basin less economical and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThere has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing. \n\nEndangered Species \n\nThe federal Endangered Species Act, or ESA, and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species, such as the recently listed lesser prairie chicken, are located in areas where we operate, our operations or any work performed related to them could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unprotected species, such as dunes sagebrush lizard, in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOther Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry \n\nThe oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production. \n\nThe availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC&#8217;s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas. \n\nAlthough oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, the U.S. Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by the U.S. Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. \n\nDrilling and Production. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following; the location of wells; the method of drilling and casing wells; the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures; the rates of production or &#8220;allowables&#8221;; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties. \n\nState laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill. \n\nFederal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the plugging and abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. Although the Corps does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements. \n\nNatural Gas Sales. Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in &#8220;first sales,&#8221; which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOil Sales and Transportation. Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, the U.S. Congress could reenact price controls in the future. \n\nOur crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act, and we have a tariff on file with FERC to perform oil gathering service in interstate commerce. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors. \n\nFurther, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines, including us, must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors. \n\nSafety and Maintenance Regulation. In our midstream operations, we are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, under the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, or HLPSA, and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. HLPSA covers petroleum and petroleum products, including natural gas liquids and condensate, and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the United States Secretary of Transportation. These regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these HLPSA regulations. \n\nWe are also subject to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act establishes mandatory inspections for all United States crude oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering pipelines in high-consequence areas within ten years. DOT, through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, has developed regulations implementing the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act that requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other safety protections in areas where the consequences of potential pipeline accidents pose the greatest risk to people and their property. \n\nThe Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act, enacted in 2011, and the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016, also known as the PIPES Act, enacted in 2016, amended the HLPSA and increased safety regulation. The Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act doubles the maximum administrative fines for safety violations from $100,000 to $200,000 for a single violation and from $1.0 million to $2.0 million for a related series of violations (now increased for inflation to $239,142 and $2,391,412, respectively), and provides that these maximum penalty caps do not apply to civil enforcement actions, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines, including the expansion of integrity management, use of automatic and remote-controlled shut-off valves, leak detection systems, sufficiency of existing regulation of gathering pipelines, use of excess flow valves, verification of maximum allowable operating pressure, incident notification, and other pipeline-safety related requirements. The PIPES Act ensures that the PHMSA completes the Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act requirements; reforms PHMSA to be a more dynamic, data-driven regulator; and closes gaps in federal standards. \n\nPHMSA has undertaken rulemakings to address many areas of this legislation. For example, on October 1, 2019, PHMSA published final rules to expand its integrity management requirements and impose new pressure testing requirements on regulated pipelines, including certain segments outside High Consequence Areas. The rules, once effective, also extend reporting requirements to certain previously unregulated gathering lines. Also, on November 15, 2021, PHMSA published a final rule extending reporting requirements to all onshore gas gathering operators and establishing a set of minimum safety requirements for certain gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures. Further, on August 24, 2022, PHMSA published a final rule strengthening integrity management requirements for onshore gas transmission lines, bolstering corrosion control standards and repair criteria, and imposing new requirements for inspections after extreme weather events. These requirements and related rule making proceedings, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. In addition, any material penalties or fines issued to us under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flow. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nStates are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards, and many states have undertaken responsibility to enforce the federal standards. For example, on December 17, 2019, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules requiring that operators of gathering lines take 'appropriate' actions to fix safety hazards. We do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with applicable federal and state laws and regulations in Texas. Our gathering pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements. \n\nIn addition, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. Moreover, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Rattler LLC and the entities in which it owns an interest are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. These regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds, or any process which involves flammable liquid or gas, pressurized tanks, caverns and wells in excess of 10,000 pounds at various locations. Flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt from these standards. Also, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies such as the EPA continue to develop regulations concerning the security of industrial facilities, including crude oil and natural gas facilities. We are subject to a number of requirements and must prepare Federal Response Plans to comply. We must also prepare Risk Management Plans under the regulations promulgated by the EPA to implement the requirements under the CAA to prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with safeguard and security requirements. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety and security. \n\nState Regulation. Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill. \n\nThe petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us. \n\nOperational Hazards and Insurance \n\nThe oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow outs, pipe failures and, in some cases, abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. \n\nIn accordance with what we believe to be industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We currently have insurance policies for onshore property (oil lease property/production equipment) for selected locations, control of well protection for all wells, comprehensive general liability, commercial automobile, workers compensation, pollution liability (claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date), excess umbrella liability and other coverage. \n\nOur insurance is subject to certain exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses. Any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211;Risks Related to the \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business&#8211;Operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits.&#8221; \n\nWe reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy terms and limits annually. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nGenerally, we also require our third-party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for property damage and injuries and deaths of the service provider&#8217;s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nWe have developed a culture grounded upon the solid foundation of our core values&#8212;leadership, integrity, excellence, people and teamwork&#8212;that are adhered to throughout our company. We set a high bar for all of our employees in terms of how they operate and interact, both within the office and out in the field. We challenge them to identify new ways to foster a better future for themselves and for us. Our board of directors, through its Safety, Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee, which we refer to as the SS&#38;CR Committee, provides an important oversight of our human capital management strategy, including diversity, equity and inclusion. In January 2022, the SS&#38;CR Committee&#8217;s charter was amended accordingly to include oversight of management of human capital as part of its ongoing responsibilities. The SS&#38;CR Committee receives regular updates from our executive leadership, senior management and third-party consultants on human capital trends and other key human capital matters impacting our business. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 972 full time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We also utilize independent contractors and consultants involved in land, technical, regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full-time employees. \n\nDiversity, Inclusion, Recruiting and Retention \n\nEqual employment opportunity is one of our core tenets and, as such, our employment decisions are based on merit, qualifications, competencies and contributions. We actively seek to attract and retain an increasingly diverse workforce and continue to cultivate our respectful work environment. We value the perspectives, experiences and ideas contributed by our employees from a diverse range of ethnic, cultural and ideological backgrounds. Over 28% of our employees are women and over 33% of our employees self-identify as ethnic minorities as of December 31, 2022. We disclosed for the first time our 2021 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) data as of December 31, 2021 in our 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report in an effort to provide additional transparency into the Company&#8217;s workforce demographics. \n\nIn 2022, we took various actions to increase the diversity of job applicants and expand our recruitment efforts, particularly in our college recruitment and internship programs. We collaborated with several student organizations to reinforce this inclusive initiative, which will continue in the future. In addition, we have focused on recruiting experienced hires to target and retain top industry talent. We have historically had a low annual attrition rate, representing approximately 13% in 2022, despite the challenging labor market and increased competition for talent impacted by the potential economic downturn and the high inflationary environment. We believe that our low attrition rate is in part a result of our corporate culture focused on diversity and inclusion, teamwork and commitment to employee development and career advancement discussed in more detail below. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nProtecting employees, the public and the environment is a top priority in our operations and in the way we manage our assets. We are focused on minimizing the risk of workplace incidents and preparing for emergencies as an ingrained element of our corporate responsibility. We also strive to comply with all applicable health, safety and environmental standards, laws and regulations. \n\nWe have committed to reduce injuries and fatalities in our business and are focused on safety culture improvements, safety leadership actions and human performance principles. We are requiring our operational employees and independent contractors and their employees to go through orientation and training aligned with the International Association of Oil and \n\nTable of Contents \n\nGas Producers Life Saving Rules, a program that also meets the operational safety requirements adopted by the American Petroleum Institute. We also involve employees from all operational levels in our safety program to provide input and suggested improvements to the overall safety program, recommend preventative measures based on reviewing vehicle and personnel incidents, safety and environmental audits at operational locations and participate in the audit and oversight of the Diamondback Hazard Communication Program. \n\nFrom 2018 through 2022, we had no employee work-related fatalities. Our employee OSHA recordable cases, comprising work-related injuries and illnesses that require medical treatment beyond first aid, totaled six in 2022, up from two in 2021. Our employee total recordable incident rate (TRIR) was 0.68 in 2022 up from 0.25 in 2021 and lost-time incident rate (LTIR) was 0.23 in 2022 up from 0.12 in 2021. At December 31, 2022, we have a short term goal of maintaining an employee TRIR of 0.25 or less. \n\nTraining and Development \n\nWe support employees in pursuing training opportunities to expand their professional skills. Our internal course offerings in 2022 included a wide array of topics in addition to extensive safety and other compliance training sessions. Additionally, our people undergo training and education each year on regulatory compliance, industry standards and innovative opportunities to effectively manage the challenges of developing our resources. We have also implemented development programs that are designed to build leadership capabilities at all levels. \n\nOur Facilities \n\nOur corporate headquarters is located at the Fasken Center in Midland, Texas. We also lease additional office space in Midland, Texas, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Denver, Colorado. \n\nAvailability of Company Reports \n\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.diamondbackenergy.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Information contained on, or connected to, our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Reports filed or furnished with the SEC are also made available on its website at www.sec.gov. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nThe nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities. Other risks are described in Item 1. &#8220;Business and Properties,&#8221; Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Item 7A. &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221; These risks are not the only risks we face. We could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline. \n\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results: \n\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business \n\n&#8226; Market conditions and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas may continue to adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production and the present value of our estimated reserves. \n\n&#8226; Our business and operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 pandemic and volatility in the oil and natural gas markets. \n\n&#8226; Our commodity price derivatives could result in financial losses, may fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices, prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty credit risk. \n\n&#8226; The IRA and other risks relating to climate change could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and could impose new costs on our operations that may have a material and adverse effect on us. \n\n&#8226; Climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives may have other adverse effects, such as a greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all to fund our acquisitions or development activities, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves and future production. \n\n&#8226; Our failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings, and title defects in the properties in which we invest may lead to losses. \n\n&#8226; Our identified potential drilling locations are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. \n\n&#8226; If production from our Permian Basin acreage decreases, we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract, which may adversely affect our operations. \n\n&#8226; The inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations, or loss of one or more of our significant purchasers, may adversely affect our financial results. \n\n&#8226; Our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value. \n\n&#8226; Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. \n\n&#8226; We are vulnerable to risks associated with our primary operations concentrated in a single geographic area. \n\n&#8226; If transportation or other facilities, certain of which we do not control, or rigs, equipment, raw materials, oil services or personnel are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced. \n\n&#8226; Our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive and may impose restrictions on our operations. \n\n&#8226; U.S. tax legislation, including recently adopted IRA, may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. \n\n&#8226; Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business and could adversely affect our business. \n\n&#8226; A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. \n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness \n\n&#8226; Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness, and we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. \n\n&#8226; Implementing our capital programs may require, under some circumstances, an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances, and any significant reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility or inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures. \n\n&#8226; Restrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities. \n\n&#8226; We depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments. \n\n&#8226; If we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit. \n\n&#8226; Borrowings under our and Viper LLC&#8217;s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk. \n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock \n\n&#8226; The corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us. \n\n&#8226; If the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, an investment in us could lose value. \n\n&#8226; The declaration of dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors, and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchases of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders. \n\n&#8226; A change of control could limit our use of net operating losses. \n\n&#8226; If our operating results do not meet expectations of securities or industry analysts, our stock price could decline. \n\n&#8226; We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock. \n\n&#8226; Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business \n\nMarket conditions for oil and natural gas, and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production and the present value of our estimated reserves. \n\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia; the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the global energy markets; the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East; the ability of members of the OPEC+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; the level of consumer product demand; extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters; risks associated with operating drilling rigs; technological advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including the Biden Administration&#8217;s energy and environmental policies; global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-19 and its variants; the proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and overall domestic and global economic conditions. Our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by any future government rule, regulation or order that may impose production limits, as well as pipeline capacity and storage constraints, in the Permian Basin where we operate. \n\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, NYMEX WTI prices ranged from $(37.63) to $123.70 per Bbl and the NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas ranged from $1.48 to $9.68 per MMBtu. If the prices of oil and natural gas decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe cannot predict the impact of the ongoing military war between Russia and Ukraine and the related humanitarian crisis on the global economy, energy markets, geopolitical stability and our business. \n\nOur leasehold acreage is located primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas. However, the broader consequences of the war in Ukraine, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, supply chain disruptions, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, may have adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions, increase volatility in the price and demand for oil and natural gas, increase exposure to cyberattacks, cause disruptions in global supply chains, increase foreign currency fluctuations, cause constraints or disruption in the capital markets and limit sources of liquidity. We cannot predict the extent of the war&#8217;s effect on our business and results of operations as well as on the global economy and energy markets. \n\nIn prior periods, our business and operations were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and volatility in the oil and natural gas markets, compounded by the global effects of the war in Ukraine, and we may experience such adverse effects in future periods. If commodity prices decrease, our production, estimates of proved reserves and liquidity may be adversely affected. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the global effects of the war in Ukraine, contributed to economic and pricing volatility that adversely impacted in prior periods, and may in the future adversely impact, our business and our industry. Despite the recovery and overall strength in demand and pricing for oil in 2022, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and/or returning capital to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling prog ram. We intend to continue exercising capital discipline and expect to maintain flat oil production in 2023 at the fourth quarter 2022 level, excluding production from recent acquisitions. We cannot reasonably predict whether production levels will remain at current levels or the full extent of the events above and any subsequent recovery may have on our industry and our business. \n\nDue to the improvement in commodity pricing environment and industry conditions, we did not record any impairments in 2022. However, if commodity prices fall below current levels, we may be required to record impairments in future periods and such impairments could be material. Further, if commodity prices decrease, our production, proved reserves and cash flows will be adversely impacted. Reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which could limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to present operational, health, labor, logistics and other challenges, and it is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nThere continue to be many variables and uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence, contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus and their severity; the effectiveness of current treatments and vaccines against the virus or its new strains; any travel restrictions, business closures and other measures that are or may be imposed in affected areas or countries by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain; competitive labor market; logistics costs; remote working arrangements, social distancing guidelines and other COVID-19-related challenges. Further, there remain increased risks of cyberattacks on information technology systems used in a remote working environment; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; absence of workforce due to illness; the impact of the pandemic on any of our contractual counterparties; and other factors that are currently unknown or considered immaterial. It is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nOur commodity price derivatives could result in financial losses, may fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices, prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty credit risk. \n\nWe use commodity price derivatives, including swaps, basis swaps, swaptions, roll hedges, costless collars, puts and basis puts, to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas sales. Currently, we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2023 and 2024 production. To the extent that the prices of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further, we may not be able to economically hedge additional future production at the same level as our current commodity price derivatives, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted. While these commodity price derivatives are intended to mitigate risk from commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in the prices of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas above the price levels of the commodity price derivatives used to manage price risk. \n\nAt settlement, market prices for commodities may exceed the contract prices in our commodity price derivatives agreements, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties. Further, by using commodity derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to credit risk if we are in a positive position at contract settlement and the counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We do not require collateral from our counterparties. \n\nFor additional information regarding our outstanding derivative contracts as of December 31, 2022, see Note 12&#8212; Derivatives to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212;Commodity Price Risk . \n\nThe IRA and other risks relating to climate change could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and could impose new costs on our operations that may have a material and adverse effect on us. \n\nGovernmental and regulatory bodies, investors, consumers, industry and other stakeholders have been increasingly focused on climate change matters in recent years. This focus, together with changes in consumer and industrial/commercial behavior, preferences and attitudes with respect to the generation and consumption of energy, the use of hydrocarbons, and the use of products manufactured with, or powered by, hydrocarbons, may result in: \n\n&#8226; the enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives by governments, investors, and other companies, including alternative energy or &#8220;zero carbon&#8221; requirements and fuel or energy conservation measures; \n\n&#8226; technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy (including advances in wind, solar and hydrogen power, as well as battery technology); \n\n&#8226; increased availability of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, energy sources other than oil and natural gas (including wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal sources as well as electric vehicles); and \n\n&#8226; development of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, lower-emission products and services (including electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial power supplies) as well as more efficient products and services. \n\nAny of these developments may reduce the demand for products manufactured with (or powered by) hydrocarbons and the demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell, which would likely have a material adverse impact on us. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIf any of these developments reduce the desirability of participating in the oilfield services, midstream or downstream portions of the oil and gas industry, then these developments may also reduce the availability to us of necessary third-party services and facilities that we rely on, which could increase our operational costs and adversely affect our ability to explore for, produce, transport and process oil and natural gas and successfully carry out our business and financial strategy. The enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives may also result in increases in our compliance costs and other operating costs and have other adverse effects, such as a greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which includes billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration. These incentives could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell and adversely impact our business. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of greenhouse gases through a methane emissions charge, which could increase our operating costs and thereby adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nIn addition to potentially reducing demand for our oil and natural gas and potentially reducing the availability of oilfield services and midstream and downstream customers, any of these developments may also create reputational risks associated with the exploration for, and production of, hydrocarbons, which may adversely affect the availability and cost to us of capital. For example, a number of prominent investors have publicly announced their intention to no longer invest in the oil and gas sector in response to concerns related to climate change, and other financial institutions and investors may decide to do likewise in the future. If financial institutions and other investors refuse to invest in or provide capital to the oil and gas sector in the future because of these reputational risks, that could result in capital being unavailable to us, or only at significantly increased cost. \n\nFor further discussion regarding the risks to us of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives, please see the section entitled &#8220; Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties &#8212;Regulation&#8212;Climate Change.&#8221; \n\nContinuing political and social concerns relating to climate change may result in significant litigation and related expenses. \n\nIncreasing attention to global climate change has resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect us. For example, shareholder activism has recently been increasing in our industry, and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance to deal with climate change-related issues, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise, which may result in significant management distraction and potentially significant expense. \n\nAdditionally, cities, counties, and other governmental entities in several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against energy companies seeking damages allegedly associated with climate change. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. If any such lawsuits were to be filed against us, we could incur substantial legal defense costs and, if any such litigation were adversely determined, we could incur substantial damages. \n\nAny of these climate change-related litigation risks could result in unexpected costs, negative sentiments about our company, disruptions in our operations, and increases to our operating expenses, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur targets related to sustainability and emissions reduction initiatives, including our public statements and disclosures regarding them, may expose us to numerous risks. \n\nWe have developed, and will continue to develop, targets related to our ESG initiatives, including our emissions reduction targets and strategy. Statements in this and other reports we file with the SEC and other public statements related to these initiatives reflect our current plans and expectations and are not a guarantee the targets will be achieved or achieved on the currently anticipated timeline. Our ability to achieve our ESG targets, including emissions reductions, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control, and failure to achieve our announced targets or comply with ethical, environmental or other standards, including reporting standards, may expose us to government enforcement actions or private litigation and adversely impact our business. Further, our continuing efforts to research, establish, accomplish and accurately report on these targets may create additional operational risks and expenses and expose us to reputational, legal and other risks. \n\nInvestor and regulatory focus on ESG matters continues to increase. If our ESG initiatives do not meet our investors&#8217; or other stakeholders&#8217; evolving expectations and standards, investment in our stock may be viewed as less attractive and our reputation, contractual, employment and other business relationships may be adversely impacted. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. \n\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nA significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income. \n\nA significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. In addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and to maintain the production in paying quantities, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells and maintaining such production, we could lose our rights under such leases. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage. \n\nOur development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves. \n\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. In 2022, our total capital expenditures, including expenditures for drilling, completion, infrastructure and additions to midstream assets, were approximately $1.9 billion. Our 2023 capital budget for drilling, completion and infrastructure, including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects, is currently estimated to be approximately $2.50 billion to $2.70 billion, representing an increase of 37% from our 2022 capital expenditures. Since completing our initial public offering in October 2012, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and our senior notes. \n\nWe intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, while future acquisitions may also be funded from operations as well as proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including our proved reserves; the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells; the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold; our ability to acquire, locate and produce economically new reserves; and our ability to borrow under our credit facility. \n\nWe cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, our actual capital expenditures in 2023 could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include traditional reserve base borrowings, debt financing, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. \n\nIf we are unable to fund our capital requirements or our costs of capital increase, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. In addition, a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOur success depends on finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves. \n\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. To increase reserves and production, we undertake development, exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities. If we are unable to replace our current production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Furthermore, although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly, our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase. \n\nOur failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth. \n\nThere is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials, operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities. \n\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain, and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, including title or environmental issues, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. \n\nCompetition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. If these acquisitions include geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, we could be subject to unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. In addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. Further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. \n\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our financial position and results of operations may also fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods. \n\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest. \n\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nPrior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title \n\nTable of Contents \n\ndefects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss. \n\nOur identified potential drilling locations, which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans, are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. \n\nDrilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have approximately 8,276 gross (6,055 net) identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately $50.00 per Bbl WTI. As of December 31, 2022, only 703 of our gross identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves. These drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of infrastructure, unusual or unexpected geological formations, title problems, facility or equipment malfunctions, unexpected operational events, inclement weather, environmental and other regulatory requirements and approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs, drilling results and the availability of water. Further, our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we have identified approximately 2,148 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells, which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours. We cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. Through December 31, 2022, we are the operator of, have participated in, or have acquired working interest in a total of 3,254 horizontal producing wells completed on our acreage. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the Permian Basin may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. In a highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities. \n\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any reduction in our current drilling program, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations. Any non-renewal or other loss of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis, cash flows and results of operations. \n\nIf production from our Permian Basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contracts, which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations. \n\nWe are a party to long-term crude oil agreements under which, subject to certain terms and conditions, we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to our counterparties. Our maximum delivery obligation under these agreements varies for different periods and depends in some cases upon certain conditions beyond our control. If production from our Permian Basin acreage decreases due to reduced developmental activities, as a result of the low commodity price environment, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may be unable to meet our obligations under our oil purchase agreements, which may result in deficiency payments to certain counterparties or a default under such agreements and may have an adverse effect on our company. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results. \n\nIn addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate (approximately $93 million at December 31, 2022) and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $618 million at December 31, 2022). Joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. We are generally unable to control which co-owners participate in our wells. \n\nWe are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. See &#8220; Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties &#8212;Oil and Natural Gas Production Prices and Production Costs&#8212;Marketing and Customers&#8221; for additional information regarding these customers. This concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by any adverse changes in economic and other conditions. We do not require our customers to post collateral. Under certain circumstances, the revenue due to them can be offset by any unpaid receivables. The inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results. \n\nOur method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value. \n\nWe account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. We also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment. \n\nThe net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. We use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues. \n\nNo impairments were recorded on our proved oil and natural gas properties for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. An impairment of $6.0 billion was recorded for our proved oil and natural gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2020. See &#8220; Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212;Method of Accounting for Oil and Natural Gas Properties.&#8221; If the prices of oil and natural gas decline, we may be required to further write-down the value of our oil and natural gas properties in the future, which could negatively affect our results of operations. \n\nOur estimated reserves and EURs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. \n\nOil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves, projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. The EURs for our horizontal wells are based on management&#8217;s internal estimates. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. Also, certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices, production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows. A substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves. \n\nThe standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves. \n\nThe present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves, or standardized measure may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12-month average oil index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. \n\nActual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board Codification 932, &#8220;Extractive Activities&#8212;Oil and Gas,&#8221; may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. \n\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. \n\nApproximately 31% of our total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2022, were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling and completion operations. The reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves. \n\nOur producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks (including weather-related risks) associated with operating in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area. \n\nOur producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids, and extreme weather conditions and their adverse impact on production volumes, availability of electrical power, road accessibility and transportation facilities. \n\nExtreme regional weather events may occur that can affect our suppliers or customers, which could adversely affect us. For example, a significant hurricane or similar weather event could damage refining and other oil and natural gas-related facilities on the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, which (if significant enough) could limit the availability of gathering and transportation facilities across Texas and could then cause production in the Permian Basin (including potentially our production) to be curtailed or shut in or (in the case of natural gas) flared. Further, any increase in flaring of our natural gas production due to weather-related events or otherwise could make it difficult for us to achieve our publicly-announced sustainability and emissions reduction targets, which could expose us to reputational risks and adversely impact our contractual and other business relationships. Any of the above-referenced events could have a material adverse effect on us. Likewise, a weather event could reduce the availability of electrical power, road accessibility, and transportation facilities, which could have an adverse impact on our production volumes (and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations). \n\nIn addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of \n\nTable of Contents \n\nproperties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, as of December 31, 2022, most of our proved reserves are concentrated in the Wolfberry play in the Midland Basin. This concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field. \n\nWe depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. The loss of one or more of these purchasers could, among other factors, limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce. \n\nThe availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce. We cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production. In addition, we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. See &#8220; Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties &#8212;Oil and Natural Gas Production Prices and Production Costs&#8212;Marketing and Customers&#8221; for additional information regarding these customers. The loss of one or more of these customers, and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. \n\nThe unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations. \n\nThe oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. In accordance with customary industry practice, we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells. If we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire. In addition, we do not have long-term contracts securing the use of our existing rigs, and the operators of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. Over the past several years, Texas has experienced extreme drought conditions. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water, we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nRecent regulatory restrictions on the disposal of produced water and additional monitoring and reporting requirements related to existing and additional monitoring new produced water disposal wells in the Permian Basin to stem rising seismic activity and earthquakes could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nIn September 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission curtailed the amount of produced water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near Midland and Odessa in the Permian Basin, and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. These actions were taken in an effort to control induced seismic activity and recent increases in earthquakes in the Permian Basin, which have been linked by the U.S. and local seismologists to wastewater disposal in oil fields. The Texas Railroad Commission has since adopted rules governing the permitting or re- \n\nTable of Contents \n\npermitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. These restrictions on the disposal of produced water and additional monitoring and reporting requirements related to existing and new disposal of produced water and additional monitoring and reporting requirements related to existing and new produced water disposal wells could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or dispose of it by other means, all of which could be costly. We or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, or require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells. These factors may make drilling activity in the affected parts of the Permian Basin less economical and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nIn response to recent seismic activity in the Midland Basin over the past couple of years, the Texas Railroad Commission has pursued a series of actions commencing in the latter half of 2021, including suspending deep disposal activity and curtailing certain shallow disposal activities in the areas of heightened seismic activity. Such restrictions have not had a material impact on our operations to date, but further restrictions across the basin as a result of more stringent regulations or legal directives, potential litigation or other developments could increase our operating costs and materially impact our ability to dispose of produced water, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future. \n\nOur development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future. \n\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques; therefore, the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. \n\nOur operations involve developing and utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; spacing of wells to maximize economic return; \n\n&#8226; landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone; \n\n&#8226; staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; \n\n&#8226; running our casing the entire length of the well bore; and \n\n&#8226; being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. \n\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to: \n\n&#8226; fracture stimulate the planned number of stages; \n\n&#8226; run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations; \n\n&#8226; successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; and \n\n&#8226; prevent unintentional communication with other wells. \n\nFurthermore, certain of the new techniques we are adopting, such as infill drilling and multi-well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of infill drilling, offset wells being shut in and, in the case of multi-well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. The results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas. \n\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, and/or declines in natural gas and oil prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we \n\nTable of Contents \n\nanticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future. \n\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. If these facilities are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced. \n\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties. Our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering line, which interconnects with third party pipelines. Our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with a purchaser or into a third-party gathering system. We do not control third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied. Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. For example, on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the Permian Basin. If, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. In addition, the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control, such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance, excessive pressure, ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we are provided with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive. \n\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation, remediation, emission and disposal of oil and natural gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. Further, these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us. In addition, federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. Even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease, the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the long-term, and at the state and local levels. See &#8220; Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties &#8212;Regulation&#8221; for a detailed description of certain laws and regulations that affect us. \n\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate. \n\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered, such as the recent designation of lesser prairie chickens in southwestern Texas as endangered, could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDerivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the SEC, and certain federal regulators of financial institutions (Prudential Regulators), to adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act established margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities. Although some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued a number of rules, including rules requiring clearing of certain swaps through registered clearing facilities (Mandatory Clearing Rule), requiring the posting of collateral for uncleared swaps (Margin Rule) and imposing position limits (Position Limit Rule). There are exceptions, subject to meeting certain filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, the Margin Rule and the Position Limit Rule. \n\nWe qualify for the &#8220;end user&#8221; exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule and the &#8220;non-financial end user&#8221; exception to the Margin Rule and we believe that the majority, if not all, of our hedging activities qualify for the &#8220;bona fide hedging transaction or position&#8221; exception to the Position Limit Rule. We intend to satisfy the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements to use these exceptions, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. However, most if not all of our swap counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing and collateral requirements in connection with their hedging activities with other counterparties that do not qualify for exceptions to these rules, which could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts or reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business. \n\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (collectively, Foreign Regulations), which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations (Foreign Counterparties). The Foreign Regulations, the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated and other regulations could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Foreign Regulations or other regulations, our results of operations and cash flows may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations. \n\nU.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. \n\nFrom time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and natural gas industry, including (i) eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. These proposed changes in the U.S. tax law, if adopted, or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration, development or similar activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which, among other changes, imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (&#8220;CAMT&#8221;) on the &#8220;adjusted financial statement income&#8221; of certain large corporations (generally, corporations reporting at least $1 billion average adjusted pre-tax net income on their consolidated financial statements) as well as an excise tax of 1% on the fair market value of certain public company stock repurchases for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. If we are or become subject to CAMT, our cash obligations for U.S. federal income taxes could be significantly accelerated. To the extent the 1% excise tax applies to repurchases of shares under our common stock repurchase program, the number of shares we repurchase and our cash flow may be affected. \n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies are expected to issue guidance on how the CAMT, stock buyback excise tax and other provisions of the IRA will be applied or otherwise \n\nTable of Contents \n\nadministered that may differ from our interpretations. We continue to evaluate the IRA and its effect on our financial results and operating cash flow. \n\nWe operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets. \n\nOur operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas, an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly. As a result, demand for qualified personnel in this area, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. Moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. \n\nAny delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes. Any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business. \n\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Travis D. Stice, could disrupt our operations. We do not have employment agreements with our executives and may not be able to assure their retention. Further, we do not maintain &#8220;key person&#8221; life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees. \n\nOperating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits. \n\nOur operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. In addition, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations. \n\nWe endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods, which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing, drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface, intermediate and production casing. Under our agreements with our vendors, to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties, (i) our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors&#8217; equipment while in their control and (ii) we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations, including pre-existing pollution and pollution which may result from fire, blowout, cratering, seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil, gas or other substances, as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids. In addition, we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendor-owned property that occurs in the well hole (except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage, rather than day work, basis) or as a result of the use of equipment, certain corrosive fluids, additives, chemicals or proppants. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice, we historically have maintained insurance against some, but not all, of our business risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer. Also, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, we may \n\nTable of Contents \n\nnot be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. We may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance. \n\nSince hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, we maintain insurance to protect against claims made for bodily injury and property damage, and that insurance includes coverage for clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the &#8220;occurrence&#8221; to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. We have limited coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. In addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations. \n\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical. \n\nWe own interests in certain pipeline projects and other joint ventures, and we may in the future enter into additional joint ventures, and our control of such entities is limited by provisions of the governing documents of such entities and by our percentage ownership in such entities. \n\nWe have ownership interests in several joint ventures, including the EPIC, Wink to Webster, BANGL, WTG and OMOG joint ventures, and we may enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. While we own equity interests and have certain voting rights with respect to our joint ventures, we do not act as operator of or control our joint ventures (including our 43% interest in the OMOG joint venture), each of which is operated by another joint venture partner. We have limited ability to influence the business decisions of these entities, and it may therefore be difficult or impossible for us to cause the joint venture to take actions that we believe would be in our or the relevant joint venture&#8217;s best interests. Moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing us to fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which we may not control. In addition, our joint venture partners may not satisfy their financial obligations to the joint venture and may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, or those of the joint venture. \n\nWe are also unable to control the amount of cash we receive from the operation of these entities. Further, certain of these joint ventures have incurred substantial debt and servicing such debt or complying with debt covenants may limit the ability of the joint ventures to make distributions to us and the other joint venture partners. These joint ventures also have internal control environments independent of our oversight and review. If our joint venture partners have control deficiencies in their accounting or financial reporting environments, it may result in inaccuracies in the reporting for our percentage of the financial results for the joint venture. \n\nWe may not own in fee the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to our midstream services. \n\nThe majority of the land on which our midstream systems have been constructed is owned by third parties or held by surface use agreements, rights-of-way, surface leases or other easement rights, which may limit or restrict our rights or access to or use of the surface estates. Accommodating these competing rights of the surface owners may adversely affect our midstream operations. In addition, we are subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rights-of-way, surface leases or other easement rights or if such usage rights lapse or terminate. We may obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew rights-of-way, surface leases or other easement rights or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry. \n\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business. \n\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers&#8217; operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. \n\nOur operations depend heavily on electrical power, internet and telecommunication infrastructure and information and computer systems. If any of these systems are compromised or unavailable, our business could be adversely affected. \n\nWe are heavily dependent on electrical power, internet and telecommunications infrastructure and our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such infrastructure, systems or programs were to fail or become unavailable or compromised, or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, our ability to safely and effectively operate our business will be limited and any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. \n\nAs an exploration and production company, we rely extensively on information technology systems, including internally developed software, data hosting platforms, real-time data acquisition systems, third-party software, cloud services and other internally or externally hosted hardware and software platforms, to (i) estimate our oil and natural gas reserves, (ii) process and record financial and operating data, (iii) process and analyze all stages of our business operations, including exploration, drilling, completions, production, transportation, pipelines and other related activities and (iv) communicate with our employees and vendors, suppliers and other third parties. Further, our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of personal devices, remote communications and work-from-home or hybrid work practices that evolved in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nOur systems and networks, and those of our vendors, service providers and other third party providers, may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks; malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. If any of these security breaches were to occur, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, including our exploration, completion, production and corporate functions, which could materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; unauthorized access to, and release of, our business data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information, which could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources, or reduce our competitive advantage over other companies; \n\n&#8226; data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions during our drilling activities, which could result in our failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident; \n\n&#8226; data corruption or operational disruptions of our production-related infrastructure, which could result in loss of production or accidental discharges; \n\n&#8226; unauthorized access to, and release of, personal information of our employees, vendors, service providers or other third parties, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect such information; \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; a cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider, which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt our operations; \n\n&#8226; a cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining or other facilities, which could result in reduced demand for our production or delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, in either case resulting in a loss of revenues; \n\n&#8226; a cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues; \n\n&#8226; a deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory enforcement actions, fines or penalties; \n\n&#8226; a cybersecurity attack on a communications network or power grid, which could cause operational disruptions resulting in a loss of revenues; and \n\n&#8226; a cybersecurity attack on our automated and surveillance systems, which could cause a loss of production and potential environmental hazards. \n\nWe have implemented and invested in, and will continue to implement and invest in, controls, procedures and protections (including internal and external personnel) that are designed to protect our systems, identify and remediate on a regular basis vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threat. Such measures, however, cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats and the controls, procedures and protections we have implemented and invested in may prove to be ineffective. We maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets, however, we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness \n\nReferences in this section to &#8220;us, &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; shall mean Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Diamondback E&#38;P LLC, collectively, unless otherwise specified. \n\nImplementing our capital programs may require, under some circumstances, an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances, and any significant reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility or inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures. \n\nWe have historically relied on availability under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. We expect that we will continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures with borrowings under the revolving credit facility, cash flow from operations and the proceeds from debt and equity offerings. In the past, we have created availability under the revolving credit facility by repaying outstanding borrowings with the proceeds from debt or equity offerings. We cannot assure you that we will choose to or be able to access the capital markets to repay any such future borrowings. Instead, we may be required or choose to finance our capital expenditures through additional debt issuances, which would increase our total amount of debt outstanding. If the availability under the revolving credit facility were reduced, and we were otherwise unable to secure other sources of financing, we may be required to curtail our capital expenditures, which could limit our ability to fund our drilling activities and acquisitions or otherwise finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves. \n\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities. \n\nCertain of our debt instruments contain, and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; make certain investments; create liens; sell or transfer assets; issue preferred stock; merge or consolidate with another entity; pay dividends or make other distributions; create unrestricted subsidiaries; and engage in transactions with affiliates. A breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under the applicable debt instrument. \n\nUnder our revolving credit facility we are allowed, among other things, to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as &#8220;unrestricted subsidiaries&#8221; that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility. Under our revolving credit facility, we designated Viper, Viper&#8217;s General Partner, Viper&#8217;s subsidiary, Rattler, Rattler&#8217;s GP and Rattler&#8217;s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, and upon such designation, they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the revolving credit facility, including the related guaranty. Further Viper, Viper&#8217;s General Partner, Viper&#8217;s \n\nTable of Contents \n\nsubsidiaries, Rattler, Rattler&#8217;s GP and Rattler&#8217;s subsidiaries are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding Guaranteed Senior Notes. \n\nWe and our subsidiaries may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants and financial covenants contained in our and our subsidiaries&#8217; debt instruments. As an example, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a total net debt to capitalization ratio. The requirement that we and our subsidiaries comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business. \n\nIf a default occurs under our revolving credit facility, the lenders thereunder may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes. The lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness. \n\nOur indebtedness is structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, and our obligations are not obligations of any of our subsidiaries. \n\nOur senior indebtedness obligations are obligations exclusively of Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Diamondback E&#38;P LLC, and not of any of our other subsidiaries. None of our other subsidiaries is a guarantor of our senior indebtedness. Any assets of those subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes. Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, our senior indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries (other than Diamondback E&#38;P LLC) and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish. For additional information regarding our subsidiaries&#8217; outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022, see Note 8&#8212; Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness. \n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including our senior notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. However, we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations. In the absence of such cash flows, we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition. \n\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments. \n\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends or distributions by certain of our subsidiaries to us. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend or distribution payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face. \n\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our and our subsidiaries&#8217; revolving credit facilities and the indentures restrict, but in each case do not completely prohibit, us from doing so. Further, the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries&#8217; notes allow us to issue additional notes, incur certain other additional debt and to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the senior notes. In addition, the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. If we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes (or with the guarantees thereof), including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables, the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us or a guarantor. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. \n\nIf we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit. \n\nOur ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs. \n\nBorrowings under our and Viper LLC&#8217;s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk. \n\nOur earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our and Viper LLC&#8217;s revolving credit facilities. The terms of our and Viper LLC&#8217;s revolving credit facilities provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternate base rate tied to the secured overnight financing rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;). SOFR tends to fluctuate based on multiple factors, including general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which may increase further in 2023, and other central banks and general economic conditions. From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposure with respect to our fixed and/or floating rate debt. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 3.91% during the year ended December 31, 2022. Viper LLC&#8217;s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 4.22% during the year ended December 31, 2022. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock \n\nThe corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us. \n\nSubject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things: permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested; permits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have (i) acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests. \n\nThese provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIf the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, your investment could lose value. \n\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock. If an active public market for our common stock does not continue, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or &#8220;float&#8221; for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including our quarterly or annual operating results; changes in our earnings estimates; investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry; additions or departures of key personnel; changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors; our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts&#8217; projections; changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and announcements of legislative or regulatory changes. \n\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price. \n\nThe declaration of base and variable dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations, and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders. \n\nOn February 13, 2018, we initiated payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock payable beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The decision to pay any future base and variable dividends, however, is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. Our board of directors&#8217; determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. Based on its evaluation of these factors, the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend, whether base or variable, or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated, either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders. \n\nIn September 2021, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock, and on July 28, 2022, approved an increase in the repurchase program to $4.0 billion. We may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock by various governmental laws, rules and regulations which prevent us from purchasing our common stock during periods when we are in possession of material non-public information. Through December 31, 2022, approximately $1.5 billion has been repurchased through the repurchase program. Even though this program is in place, we may not repurchase any shares through the program and any such repurchases are completely within the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, the stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued by the board of directors at any time. Any elimination of, or reduction in, the Company&#8217;s base or variable dividend or common stock repurchase program could adversely affect the total return of an investment in and have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. \n\nIn June 2022, our board of directors approved an increase to our return of capital commitment to at least 75% of free cash flow to be distributed quarterly to our stockholders in the primary form of a base dividend with additional return of capital expected to be in the form of a variable dividend and through our stock repurchase program. The amount of cash available to return to our stockholders, if any, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter for a number of reasons, including, commodity prices, liquidity, debt levels, capital resources and other factors. The price of our common stock may deteriorate if we are unable to meet investor expectations with respect to the timing and amount of our return of capital commitment to our stockholders, and such deterioration may be material. \n\nA change of control could limit our use of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes. \n\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that experiences an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; (as defined in the Code) may be subject to limitations on its ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses (&#8220;NOLs&#8221;) or tax credits generated prior to the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase in the ownership of a corporation&#8217;s stock totaling more than 50 percentage points by one or more &#8220;5% shareholders&#8221; (as defined in the Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period. An ownership change would establish \n\nTable of Contents \n\nan annual limitation on the amount of a corporation&#8217;s pre-change NOLs or tax credits that could be utilized to offset taxable income in any future taxable year. The amount of the limitation is generally equal to the value of the corporation&#8217;s stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by an interest rate, referred to as the long-term tax-exempt rate, periodically promulgated by the IRS. This limitation, however, may be significantly increased if there is &#8220;net unrealized built-in gain&#8221; in the assets of the corporation undergoing the ownership change. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had an NOL carryforward of approximately $1.3 billion and tax credits of $4 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result of ownership changes for Diamondback Energy, Inc., QEP and Rattler, which occurred in connection with the acquisition of QEP and the Rattler Merger, our NOLs and other carryforwards, including those acquired from QEP and Rattler, are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code. However, we have determined that our fair market value and our net unrealized built-in gain position resulted in a significant increase in our Section 382 limits. Accordingly, we believe that the application of Section 382 as a result of these ownership changes will not have an adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOLs and credits. \n\nFuture changes in our stock ownership, however, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Any such ownership change may limit our ability to offset taxable income arising after such an ownership change with NOLs or other tax attributes generated prior to such an ownership change, possibly substantially. \n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline. \n\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline. \n\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock. \n\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. \n\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. \n\nThe existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders; limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent; the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws; the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors; the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation; and the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders. \n\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. &#8221; \n\nOverview \n\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. As of December 31, 2022, we have one reportable segment, the upstream segment. See Note 1&#8212; Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation and Note 17&#8212; Segment Information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion. \n\n2022 Financial and Operating Highlights \n\n&#8226; We recorded net income of $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; Increased our annual base dividend by 50% to $3.00 per share and paid dividends to stockholders of $1.6 billion during 2022 and in February 2023 declared a combined base and variable cash dividend of $2.95 per share of common stock, payable in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally on February 16, 2023, our board of directors approved an increase to the Company&#8217;s annual base dividend to $3.20 per share. \n\n&#8226; Repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock, leaving approximately $2.5 billion available for future purchases under our common stock repurchase program at December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued $2.5 billion in principal amount of senior notes and retired an aggregate of $2.4 billion in principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes. \n\n&#8226; Our average production was 386,005 MBOE/d during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; During the year ended December 31, 2022, we drilled 240 gross horizontal wells (including 197 in the Midland Basin and 43 in the Delaware Basin). \n\n&#8226; We turned 255 gross operated horizontal wells (including 213 in the Midland Basin and 42 in the Delaware Basin) to production and had capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 508,767 net acres, which primarily consisted of 325,540 net acres in the Midland Basin and 150,719 net acres in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2022, we had an estimated 8,276 gross horizontal locations that we believe to be economic at $50.00 per Bbl WTI. In addition, our publicly traded subsidiary Viper owns mineral interests underlying approximately 775,180 gross acres and 26,315 net royalty acres in the Permian Basin. We operate approximately 57% of these net royalty acres. \n\n2022 Transactions and Recent Developments \n\nPending Divestiture Transactions \n\nIn February 2023, we entered into definitive agreements with unrelated third-party buyers to divest non-core assets consisting of approximately 19,000 net acres in Glasscock County and approximately 4,900 net acres in Ward and Winkler counties for combined total consideration of $439 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. The assets being sold in these pending transactions include approximately 2 MBO/d (7 MBOE/d) of 2023 production. Both of these transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to completion of diligence and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nLario Acquisition \n\nOn January 31, 2023, we closed on the Lario Acquisition, which included approximately 25,000 gross (15,000 net) acres in the Midland Basin and certain related oil and gas assets in exchange for 4.33 million shares of our common stock and $814 million, including certain customary closing adjustments. \n\nGray Oak Divestiture \n\nOn January 9, 2023, we divested our 10% non-operating equity investment in Gray Oak for $172 million in cash proceeds and recorded a gain on the sale of equity method investments of approximately $53 million in the first quarter of 2023. \n\n2022 Acquisition Activity \n\nOn January 18, 2022, we acquired, from an unrelated third-party seller, approximately 6,200 net acres in the Delaware Basin for $232 million in cash, including customary closing adjustments. \n\nOn August 24, 2022, we completed the merger with Rattler pursuant to which we acquired all of the approximately 38.51 million publicly held outstanding common units of Rattler in exchange for approximately 4.35 million shares of our common stock. \n\nOn November 30, 2022, we acquired all leasehold interests and related assets of FireBird Energy LLC, which included approximately 75,000 gross (68,000 net) acres in the Midland Basin and certain related oil and gas assets, in exchange for 5.92 million shares of our common stock and $787 million of cash, including certain customary closing adjustments. \n\nAdditionally during the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired, from unrelated third-party sellers, approximately 4,000 net acres in the Permian Basin for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $220 million in cash, including customary closing adjustments. \n\n2022 Divestiture Activity \n\nIn October 2022, we completed the divestiture of non-core Delaware Basin acreage consisting of approximately 3,272 net acres, with net production of approximately 550 BO/d (800 BOE/d) for $155 million of net proceeds. We used the net proceeds from this transaction towards debt reduction. \n\nSee Note 4&#8212; Acquisitions and Divestiture s and Note 16&#8212; Subsequent Events of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of these transactions. \n\nCommodity Prices and Certain Other Market Considerations \n\nPrices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future, extreme weather conditions and other substantially variable factors, influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. During 2022, 2021 and 2020 the NYMEX WTI price for crude oil ranged from $(37.63) to $123.70 per Bbl, and the NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas ranged from $1.48 to $9.68 per MMBtu, with seven-year highs reached in 2022. The war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising interest rates, global supply chain disruptions, concerns about a potential economic downturn or recession and recent measures to combat persistent inflation contributed to economic and pricing volatility during 2022 and may continue to impact prices in 2023. Although the impact of inflation on our business has been insignificant in prior periods, inflation in the U.S. has been rising at its fastest rate in over 40 years, creating inflationary pressure on the cost of services, equipment and other goods in the energy industry and other sectors, which is contributing to labor and materials shortages across the supply-chain. Additionally, OPEC and its non-OPEC allies, known collectively as OPEC+, continues to meet regularly to evaluate the state of global oil supply, demand and inventory levels. However, pricing may remain volatile during of 2023. \n\nOutlook \n\nAfter giving effect for the recently completed the FireBird and Lario acquisitions, we expect to hold our pro forma oil production levels essentially flat in 2023. During 2022, we had total capital expenditures of $1.9 billion, which was consistent with our guidance presented in November of 2022. During the second quarter of 2022, we announced an increase to our quarterly return of capital commitment to at least 75% of our free cash flow beginning in the third quarter of 2022. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAccordingly, we are utilizing our free cash flow to meet our quarterly return of capital commitment and for debt repayment rather than expanding our drilling program. During 2022, we continued to pay down debt and believe we have a strong balance sheet that can withstand another down cycle. We are focused on maintaining high cash margins and a low-cost structure to drive an increasing return on capital and operational excellence, and to mitigate inflationary pressures through improvements and efficiencies in our drilling and completion programs. Going forward, we intend to continue to remain flexible and use a combination of our growing and sustainable base dividend, variable dividend and opportunistic share repurchase program to generate the highest value proposition for our stockholders. \n\nIn the Midland Basin, we continued to have positive results across our core development areas located within Midland, Martin, Howard, Glasscock and Andrews counties, where development has primarily focused on drilling long-lateral, multi-well pads targeting the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formations. \n\nIn the Delaware Basin, we continued to target the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations across our primary development areas located in Pecos, Reeves and Ward counties. Collectively, the Delaware Basin accounted for approximately 15% of our total development in 2022, and we expect a similar portion of our total development to be focused in these areas in 2023. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were operating 19 drilling rigs and four completion crews and currently intend to operate between 13 and 19 drilling rigs and between four and seven completion crews in 2023 on average across our current acreage position in the Midland and Delaware Basins. \n\nAdditionally, in the first quarter of 2023, we announced a target to sell at least $1.0 billion of non-core assets by year-end 2023, up from the previously announced target of $500 million. \n\nEnvironmental Responsibility Initiatives and Highlights \n\nIn September 2022, we announced our medium-term goal to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG intensity reduction by at least 50% from our 2020 level by 2030 and a short-term goal to implement continuous emission monitoring systems (&#8220;CEMS&#8221;) on our facilities to cover at least 90% of operated oil production by the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had installed CEMS that cover approximately 85% of our operated oil production. \n\nIn September 2021, we announced our near-term goal to end routine flaring (as defined by the World Bank) by 2025 and a near-term target to source over 65% of our water used for drilling and completion operations from recycled sources by 2025. For the full year ended 2022, we flared approximately 2.3% of our gross natural gas production and sourced approximately 41% of our water used for drilling and completion operations from recycled sources. \n\nIn February 2021, we announced significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental, social responsibility and governance, or ESG, performance and disclosure, including Scope 1 and methane emission intensity reduction targets. Our goals include the reduction of our Scope 1 greenhouse gas intensity by at least 50% and methane intensity by at least 70%, in each case by 2024 from the 2019 levels. To further underscore our commitment to carbon neutrality, we have also implemented our &#8220;Net Zero Now&#8221; initiative under which, effective January 1, 2021, we strive to produce every hydrocarbon molecule with zero net Scope 1 emissions. To the extent our greenhouse gas and methane intensity targets do not eliminate our carbon footprint, we have purchased carbon credits to offset the remaining emissions. We have also increased the weighting of ESG metrics from 20% to 25% in our annual short-term incentive compensation plan to motivate our executives and our employees to advance our environmental responsibility goals. \n\n2023 Capital Budget \n\nWe have currently budgeted 2023 total capital spend of $2.50 billion to $2.70 billion. Should commodity prices weaken, we intend to act responsibly and, consistent with our prior practices, reduce capital spending. If commodity prices strengthen, we intend to maintain flat oil production, pay down indebtedness and return cash to our stockholders. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nResults of Operations \n\nThe following discussion focuses primarily on a comparison of the results of operations between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, please refer to &#8220;Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022), which is incorporated in this report by reference from such prior report on Form 10-K. \n\nThe following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Revenues (in millions): Oil sales $ 7,660 $ 5,396 Natural gas sales 858 569 Natural gas liquid sales 1,048 782 Total oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid revenues $ 9,566 $ 6,747 Production Data: Oil (MBbls) 81,616 81,522 Natural gas (MMcf) 176,376 169,406 Natural gas liquids (MBbls) 29,880 27,246 Combined volumes (MBOE) (1) \n\n140,892 137,002 Daily oil volumes (BO/d) 223,605 223,348 Daily combined volumes (BOE/d) (1) \n\n386,005 375,349 Average Prices: Oil ($ per Bbl) $ 93.85 $ 66.19 Natural gas ($ per Mcf) $ 4.86 $ 3.36 Natural gas liquids ($ per Bbl) $ 35.07 $ 28.70 Combined ($ per BOE) $ 67.90 $ 49.25 Oil, hedged ($ per Bbl) (2) \n\n$ 86.76 $ 52.56 Natural gas, hedged ($ per Mcf) (2) \n\n$ 4.12 $ 2.39 Natural gas liquids, hedged ($ per Bbl) (2) \n\n$ 35.07 $ 28.33 Average price, hedged ($ per BOE) (2) \n\n$ 62.85 $ 39.87 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Bbl equivalents are calculated using a conversion rate of six Mcf per Bbl. \n\n(2) Hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices and include gains and losses on cash settlements for matured commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting. Hedged prices exclude gains or losses resulting from the early settlement of commodity derivative contracts. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nProduction Data \n\nSubstantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. The following table provides information on the mix of our production for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Oil (MBbls) 58 % 60 % Natural gas (MMcf) 21 % 20 % Natural gas liquids (MBbls) 21 % 20 % 100 % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nSee &#8220;Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties &#8212; Oil and Natural Gas Production Prices and Production Costs&#8221; for further discussion of production by basin. \n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\nOil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Revenues. Our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. \n\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues increased by approximately $2.8 billion, or 42%, to $9.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $6.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Higher average oil prices, and to a lesser extent natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, contributed $2.7 billion of the total increase. The remainder of the overall change is due to a 3% increase in combined volumes sold. \n\nHigher commodity prices during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily reflect the increase in demand for oil due to economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic factors such as the war in Ukraine as discussed in &#8220; &#8212; Commodity Prices and Certain Other Market Considerations &#8221; above. The increase in production for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 resulted primarily from recognizing a full year of production in the current period associated with production from the Guidon Acquisition and the QEP Merger, which occurred late in the first quarter 2021, and new well additions between periods. \n\nLease Operating Expenses. The following table shows lease operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions, except per BOE amounts) Amount Per BOE Amount Per BOE Lease operating expenses $ 652 $ 4.63 $ 565 $ 4.12 ##TABLE_END\n\nLease operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $87 million, or $0.51 per BOE, primarily due to an overall increase in utility and service costs driven by continued inflation. As a result of inflationary pressures, we expect our total lease operating expenses in 2023 to range from approximately $785 million to $883 million. \n\nProduction and Ad Valorem Tax Expense. The following table shows production and ad valorem tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions, except per BOE amounts) Amount Per BOE Amount Per BOE Production taxes $ 483 $ 3.43 $ 349 $ 2.55 Ad valorem taxes 128 0.91 76 0.55 Total production and ad valorem expense $ 611 $ 4.34 $ 425 $ 3.10 Production taxes as a % of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenue 5.0 % 5.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn general, production taxes are directly related to production revenues and are based upon current year commodity prices. Production taxes as a percentage of production revenues remained consistent for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. \n\nAd valorem taxes are based, among other factors, on property values driven by prior year commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $52 million primarily due to higher overall valuations resulting from an increase in commodity prices between valuation periods. \n\nWe expect production and ad valorem taxes to be approximately 7% to 8% of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenue during 2023. \n\nGathering and Transportation Expense. The following table shows gathering and transportation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions, except per BOE amounts) Amount Per BOE Amount Per BOE Gathering and transportation $ 258 $ 1.83 $ 212 $ 1.55 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in gathering and transportation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 is primarily due to the increase in production between periods as well as an overall increase in the cost per BOE. The increase in cost is largely attributable to higher third-party gas gathering expenses of approximately $30 million related to gathering fees incurred after we divested certain gas gathering assets during the fourth quarter of 2021, and minimum volume commitment fees of approximately $8 million. The remaining increase primarily related to rate escalations on our gathering and transportation contracts. \n\nWe expect gathering and transportation expenses to range from approximately $283 million to $321 million in 2023. \n\nDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. The following table provides the components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (In millions, except BOE amounts) 2022 2021 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 1,250 $ 1,202 Depreciation of other property and equipment 77 48 Other amortization 3 16 Asset retirement obligation accretion 14 9 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense $ 1,344 $ 1,275 Oil and natural gas properties depletion rate per BOE $ 8.87 $ 8.77 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted largely from higher production volumes and a slight increase in the average depletion rate. \n\nImpairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties. No impairment expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. In connection with the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition, we recorded the oil and natural gas properties acquired at fair value. Pursuant to SEC guidance, we determined the fair value of the properties acquired in the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition clearly exceeded the related full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, we requested and received a waiver from the SEC to exclude the acquired properties from the first quarter 2021 ceiling test calculation. As a result, no impairment expense related to the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Had we not received the waiver from the SEC, an impairment charge of approximately $1.1 billion would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2021. The properties acquired in the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition had total unamortized costs at March 31, 2021 of $3.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. \n\nImpairment charges affect our results of operations but do not reduce our cash flow. See Note 5&#8212; Property and Equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and &#8220; &#8212; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; for further details regarding factors that impact the impairment of oil and natural gas properties. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. The following table shows general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions, except per BOE amounts) Amount Per BOE Amount Per BOE General and administrative expenses $ 89 $ 0.63 $ 95 $ 0.69 Non-cash stock-based compensation 55 0.39 51 0.37 Total general and administrative expenses $ 144 $ 1.02 $ 146 $ 1.06 ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were consistent with the same period in 2021 and there were no significant individual contributing factors to the change between periods. \n\nWe expect cash general and administrative expenses to range from approximately $102 million to $128 million in 2023, and non-cash stock-based compensation to range from approximately $63 million to $80 million in 2023. \n\nMerger and Integration Expense. The following table shows merger and integration expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions) Amount Per BOE Amount Per BOE Merger and integration expenses $ 14 $ 0.10 $ 78 $ 0.57 ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal merger and integration expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates to banking, legal and advisory fees of $11 million for the Rattler Merger, $2 million for the FireBird Acquisition, and $1 million for the Lario Acquisition. \n\nMerger and integration expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes $69 million in costs incurred for the QEP Merger and $9 million in costs incurred for the Guidon Acquisition. The QEP Merger related expenses primarily consist of $39 million in severance costs and $30 million in banking, legal and advisory fees, and the Guidon Acquisition related expenses consist primarily of advisory and legal fees. See Note 4&#8212; Acquisitions and Divestitures of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further details regarding the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition. \n\nDerivative Instruments. The following table shows the net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and the net cash received (paid) on settlements of derivative instruments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 \n\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments, net (1) \n\n$ (586) $ (848) \n\nNet cash received (paid) on settlements (2)(3) \n\n$ (850) $ (1,225) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The year ended December 31, 2022 includes $57 million in losses related to interest rate swaps. \n\n(2) The year ended December 31, 2022 includes cash paid on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $138 million. \n\n(3) The year ended December 31, 2021 includes cash paid on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $16 million and cash received on interest rate swap contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $80 million. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we have a short-term derivative asset of $132 million, a long-term derivative asset of $23 million, a short-term derivative liability due in 2023 of $47 million and a long-term derivative liability due in 2024 of $148 million. \n\nSee Note 12&#8212; Derivatives of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for further details regarding our derivative instruments and interest rate swaps. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOther Income (Expense). The following table shows other income and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Interest expense, net $ (159) $ (199) Other income (expense), net $ (5) $ (10) Gain (loss) on sale of equity method investments $ &#8212; $ 23 Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt $ (99) $ (75) Income (loss) from equity investments $ 77 $ 15 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflects a $36 million increase in capitalized interest costs, which reduce interest expense, and a $26 million decrease in interest expense on our senior notes due largely to redemptions and repurchases of principal between the periods. These reductions were partially offset by an $18 million increase in interest expense on our revolving credit facility. We expect interest expense to range from approximately $204 million to $225 million in 2023. \n\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt reflects the difference between the carrying value and reacquisition price for the repurchases and redemptions of various senior notes during the 2022 and 2021 periods. \n\nSee Note 8&#8212; Debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for further details outstanding borrowings, interest expense and gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt. \n\nThe increase in income from our equity investments primarily reflects higher capacity utilization and price realizations for our midstream investees in 2022 compared to 2021, as well as increase of $38 million in income from our investment in an interconnected gas gathering system in the Midland Basin, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. \n\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. The following table shows the provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 1,174 $ 631 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe change in our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income which resulted largely from the changes in revenues from oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. See Note 11&#8212; Income Taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our income tax expense. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nOverview of Sources and Uses of Cash \n\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and sales of non-core assets. Our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties, payments to retire debt and interest expense on debt, dividends and share repurchases, and income taxes, At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity consisting of $157.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion available under our credit facility. As discussed below, our capital budget for 2023 is $2.50 billion to $2.70 billion. \n\nFuture cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production, volatility of commodity prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. Prices for our commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions, regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors &#8221; above. In order to mitigate this volatility, we enter into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions, all of which are participants in our credit facility, to economically hedge a portion of our \n\nTable of Contents \n\nestimated future crude oil and natural gas production through the end of 2023 as discussed further in Note 12&#8212; Derivatives of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212; Commodity Price Risk . The level of our hedging activity and duration of the financial instruments employed depend on our desired cash flow protection, available hedge prices, the magnitude of our capital program and our operating strategy. \n\nCash Flow \n\nOur cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 6,325 $ 3,944 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (3,330) (1,539) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (3,503) (1,841) Net change in cash $ (508) $ 564 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nThe increase in operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily resulted from (i) an increase of $2.8 billion in our total revenue, (ii) a decrease of $397 million in net cash paid on settlements of derivative contracts, and (iii) fluctuations in other working capital balances due primarily to the timing of when collections are made on accounts receivable and payments are made on accounts payable and accrued liabilities. These net cash inflows were partially offset by (i) a change of $856 million in cash paid for taxes due to making payments of $718 million in 2022 compared to receiving net refunds of $138 million in federal taxes under the 2020 CARES act in 2021, and (ii) an increase in our cash operating expenses of approximately $266 million. See &#8220; &#8212;Results of Operations &#8221; for discussion of significant changes in our revenues and expenses. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.3 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of our net cash used for investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was for the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, including the FireBird Acquisition. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of certain non-core Delaware Basin assets and other assets discussed in Note 4&#8212; Acquisitions and Divestitures . \n\nThe majority of our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was for the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, including the acquisition of certain leasehold interests as part of the Guidon Acquisition. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of our Williston Basin assets, leasehold acreage and other gathering assets discussed in Note 4&#8212; Acquisitions and Divestitures . Our capital expenditures for each period are discussed further below. \n\nCapital Expenditure Activities \n\nOur capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and equity method investments (on a cash basis) were as follows for the specified period: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions) Drilling, completions and non-operated additions to oil and natural gas properties $ 1,685 $ 1,334 Infrastructure additions to oil and natural gas properties 169 123 Additions to midstream assets 84 30 Total $ 1,938 $ 1,487 ##TABLE_END\n\nFor further discussion regarding our development program, please see the section entitled &#8220; Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties &#8212; Wells Drilled and Completed in 2022 .&#8221; \n\nTable of Contents \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3.5 billion compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $1.8 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the amount used in financing activities was primarily attributable to (i) $2.4 billion paid for the retirement of outstanding principal on certain senior notes, as well as $63 million of additional premiums paid in connection with the repurchases, (ii) $1.3 billion of repurchases as part of the share and unit repurchase programs, (iii) $1.6 billion of dividends paid to stockholders, and (iv) $217 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. The cash outflows were partially offset by (i) $2.5 billion in proceeds from our senior notes issued in 2022, and (ii) $347 million of borrowings under our and our subsidiaries&#8217; credit facilities, net of repayments. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) $3.2 billion paid for the retirement of outstanding principal on certain senior notes, as well as $178 million of additional premiums paid in connection with the repurchases, (ii) $525 million of repurchases as part of the share and unit repurchase programs, (iii) $312 million of dividends paid to stockholders, and (iv) $112 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. The cash outflows were partially offset by (i) $2.2 billion in proceeds our senior notes issued in 2021, (ii) $313 million of borrowings under our and our subsidiaries&#8217; credit facilities, net of repayments and (iii) $22 million in net cash receipts from the early settlement of interest rate swaps and commodity derivative contracts that contained an other-than-insignificant financing element. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nOur working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term capital requirements. \n\nAs we pursue our business and financial strategy, we regularly consider which capital resources, including cash flow and equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. Our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. Continued prolonged volatility in the capital, financial and/or credit markets due to the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic and/or adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our access to, or increase our cost of, capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. \n\nRevolving Credit Facilities and Senior Notes \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the maximum credit amount available under our credit agreement was $1.6 billion, which may be increased in an amount up to $1.0 billion (for a total maximum commitment amount of $2.6 billion), with no outstanding borrowings and an aggregate of $3 million in outstanding letters of credit which reduce available borrowings on a dollar for dollar basis. During the second quarter of 2022, we extended the maturity date on our credit agreement by one year to June 2, 2027, and may further extend it by two one-year extensions pursuant to the terms set forth in the credit agreement. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued $2.5 billion in principal amount of senior notes with extended maturity dates ranging from 2033 through 2053. \n\nSee Note 8&#8212; Debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our revolving credit facility and senior notes. \n\nViper&#8217;s Revolving Credit Facility \n\nViper&#8217;s credit agreement, as amended to date, matures on June 2, 2025 and provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $2.0 billion, with a borrowing base of $580 million as of December 31, 2022, although Viper had an elected commitment amount of $500 million, based on Viper LLC&#8217;s oil and natural gas reserves and other factors. At December 31, 2022, there were $152 million of outstanding borrowings and $348 million available for future borrowings under Viper&#8217;s credit agreement. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCapital Requirements \n\nIn addition to future operating expenses and working capital commitments discussed in &#8220; &#8212;Results of Operations &#8221;, our primary short and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) payments of principal and interest on our revolving credit agreements and senior notes, (ii) payments of other contractual obligations, (iii) cash commitments for dividends and share repurchases, and (iv) income taxes. \n\n2023 Capital Spending Plan \n\nOur board of directors approved a 2023 capital budget for drilling, midstream and infrastructure of $2.50 billion to $2.70 billion. We estimate that, of these expenditures, approximately: \n\n&#8226; $2.25 billion to $2.41 billion will be spent primarily on drilling 325 to 345 gross (293 to 311 net) horizontal wells and completing 330 to 350 gross (297 to 315 net) horizontal wells across our operated and non-operated leasehold acreage in the Northern Midland and Southern Delaware Basins, with an average lateral length of approximately 10,500 feet; \n\n&#8226; $80 million to $100 million will be spent on midstream infrastructure, excluding joint venture investments; and \n\n&#8226; $170 million to $190 million will be spent on infrastructure and environmental expenditures, excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions. \n\nWe do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. \n\nThe amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. We will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence and our capital expenditure budget up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions. \n\nPayments of Principal and Interest on Senior Notes \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 we retired $2.4 billion in principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes with a portion of the net proceeds from our senior notes offerings completed in March and October of 2022, cash on hand and borrowings under Viper&#8217;s revolving credit facilities, as applicable, as discussed further in Note 8&#8212; Debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we have total principal payments due on our outstanding senior notes, including those of Viper, of $10 million in 2023, $1.2 billion cumulatively in the years 2026 and 2027, and $5.0 billion thereafter. Additionally, we expect to incur future cash interest costs on these senior notes of approximately $265 million in 2023, $530 million cumulatively in the years from 2024 through 2025, $504 million cumulatively in the years from 2026 and 2027, and $2.9 billion cumulatively between 2028 and 2053. \n\nOther Contractual Obligations and Commitments \n\nAt December 31, 2022, our other significant contractual obligations consist primarily of (i) minimum transportation commitments totaling $856 million, (ii) asset retirement obligations totaling $347 million, (iii) electronic fracturing fleet and related power generation services commitments totaling $140 million and (iv) minimum purchase commitments for quantities of sand used in our drilling operations totaling $91 million. We expect to make aggregate payments of approximately $166 million for these commitments during 2023. See Note 6&#8212; Asset Retirement Obligations and Note 15&#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these and other contractual obligations and commitments. \n\nDividends and Share Repurchases \n\nIn addition to our base dividend program, in the first quarter of 2022 we initiated a variable dividend strategy whereby we may pay a quarterly variable dividend based on the prior quarter&#8217;s free cash flow remaining after the payment of the base dividend. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, our board of directors approved an increase to this return of capital commitment to at least 75% of free cash flow. On February 16, 2023, our board of directors approved an increase to the \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCompany&#8217;s annual base dividend to $3.20 per share. We have declared a base plus variable cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $2.95 per share of common stock. \n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. As used by us, free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital in excess of cash capital expenditures. We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors as it provides a measure to compare both cash flow from operating activities and additions to oil and natural gas properties across periods on a consistent basis. \n\nFuture base and variable dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors, and the board of directors may change the dividend amount from time to time based on our outlook for commodity prices, liquidity, debt levels, capital resources, free cash flow and other factors. We can provide no assurance that dividends will be authorized or declared in the future or as to the amount and type of any future dividends. Any future variable dividends, whether base or variable, if declared and paid, will by their nature fluctuate based on our free cash flow, which will depend on a number of factors beyond the our control, including commodity prices. \n\nAs of February 17, 2023, we have repurchased 13.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $1.6 billion since the inception of the repurchase program. We intend to continue to opportunistically purchase shares under this repurchase program with available funds primarily from cash flow from operations and liquidity events such as the sale of assets while maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund our capital expenditure programs. See Note 9&#8212; Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the repurchase program. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe expect our cash tax rate to be 10% to 15% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 11&#8212; Income Taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for further discussion of our income taxes. \n\nDebt Ratings \n\nWe receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and production growth opportunities. Our credit ratings from the three main credit rating agencies are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Standard and Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings Services (BBB-); \n\n&#8226; Fitch Investor Services (BBB); and \n\n&#8226; Moody&#8217;s Investor Services (Baa2). \n\nAny rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements. \n\nGuarantor Financial Information \n\nDiamondback E&#38;P is the sole guarantor under the indentures governing the outstanding Guaranteed Senior Notes. \n\nGuarantees are &#8220;full and unconditional,&#8221; as that term is used in Regulation S-X, Rule 3-10(b)(3), except that such guarantees will be released or terminated in certain circumstances set forth in the indentures governing the Guaranteed Senior Notes, such as, with certain exceptions, (i) in the event Diamondback E&#38;P (or all or substantially all of its assets) is sold or disposed of, (ii) in the event Diamondback E&#38;P ceases to be a guarantor of or otherwise be an obligor under certain other indebtedness, and (iii) in connection with any covenant defeasance, legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the relevant indenture. \n\nDiamondback E&#38;P&#8217;s guarantees of the Guaranteed Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of its future subordinated indebtedness, equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, including its obligations under its revolving credit facility, and effectively subordinated to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe rights of holders of the Guaranteed Senior Notes against Diamondback E&#38;P may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit Diamondback E&#38;P&#8217;s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of Diamondback E&#38;P. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. \n\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for Diamondback Energy, Inc., as the parent, and Diamondback E&#38;P, as the guarantor subsidiary, on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between the parent and the guarantor subsidiary and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor. The information is presented in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13-01 under the SEC&#8217;s Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the guarantor subsidiary operated as an independent entity. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 Summarized Balance Sheets: (In millions) Assets: Current assets $ 1,191 Property and equipment, net $ 18,252 Other noncurrent assets $ 164 Liabilities: Current liabilities $ 1,547 Intercompany accounts payable, non-guarantor subsidiary $ 2,253 Long-term debt $ 5,647 Other noncurrent liabilities $ 2,509 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 Summarized Statement of Operations: (In millions) Revenues $ 7,630 Income (loss) from operations $ 5,023 Net income (loss) $ 3,095 ##TABLE_END\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. \n\nCertain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. \n\nWe consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOil and Natural Gas Accounting and Reserves \n\nWe account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting, which is dependent on the estimation of proved reserves to determine the rate at which we record depletion on our oil and natural gas properties and whether the value of our evaluated oil and natural gas properties is permanently impaired based on the quarterly full cost ceiling impairment test. Further, we utilize estimated proved reserves to assign fair value to acquired proved oil and natural gas properties including mineral and royalty interests. As such, we consider the estimation of proved reserves to be a critical accounting estimate. \n\nOil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Proved oil and natural gas reserve estimates and their associated future net cash flows were prepared by our internal reservoir engineers and audited by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., independent petroleum engineers, as of December 31, 2022 and prepared by Ryder Scott as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. Significant inputs included in the calculation of future net cash flows include our estimate of operating and development costs, anticipated production of proved reserves and other relevant data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time, and reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. If such changes are material, they could significantly affect future depletion of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material. Revisions of previous reserve estimates accounted for approximately $102 million, or 1% of the change in the standardized measure of our total reserves from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. No impairments were recorded for our proved oil and gas properties during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021; however, a material impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 as discussed further in Note 5&#8212; Property and Equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Due to an increase in the historical 12-month average trailing SEC prices for oil and natural throughout 2021 and into 2022, we are not currently projecting a full cost ceiling impairment in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nAdditionally, costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. We assess all items classified as unevaluated property (on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant) at least annually for possible impairment. This assessment is subjective and includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent of the operator to drill, remaining lease term with the current operator; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. At December 31, 2022, our unevaluated properties totaled $8.4 billion, which consisted of 236,253 net undeveloped leasehold acres with approximately 465 net acres set to expire in 2023. We did not record any impairment on our unevaluated properties during the year ended December 31, 2022, but any such future impairment could potentially be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nCommodity Derivatives \n\nFrom time to time, we use commodity derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas. We exercise significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, the level of production volumes to include in our commodity derivative contracts, the prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts and the counterparties&#8217; creditworthiness. We do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes. \n\nWe have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash change in fair value on derivative instruments for each period in the consolidated statements of operations. We are also required to recognize our derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value with such amounts classified as current or long-term based on their anticipated settlement dates. The accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation, and is generally determined using various inputs and assumptions including established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other things, futures prices, time to maturity, implied volatilities and counterparty credit risk. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThese fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions, including any deferred premiums, that are with the same counterparty and are subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement. Changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur. \n\nSee Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212; Commodity Price Risk for additional sensitivity analysis of our open derivative positions at December 31, 2022. \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. \n\nWe make various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Fair value estimates are determined based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition, utilizing expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant. When market-observable prices are not available to value assets and liabilities, the Company may use the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management&#8217;s assumptions. \n\nThe most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to our proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. The assumptions made in performing these valuations include future production volumes, future commodity prices and costs, future operating and development activities, projections of oil and gas reserves and a weighted average cost of capital rate. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. In addition, when appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of natural gas and oil properties within the same regions, and use that data as a proxy for fair market value; for example, the amount a willing buyer and seller would enter into in exchange for such properties. Changes in key assumptions may cause the acquisition accounting to be revised, including the recognition of additional goodwill or discount on acquisition. There is no assurance the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation will occur as initially expected. See Note 4&#8212; Acquisitions and Divestitures of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the QEP Merger, Guidon Acquisition and FireBird Acquisition, including any significant changes in these estimates from the date of acquisition. \n\nEstimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. In addition, differences between the future commodity prices when acquiring assets and the historical 12-month average trailing price to calculate ceiling test impairments of upstream assets may impact net earnings. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, and provincial tax jurisdictions. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized after considering all positive and negative evidence available concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Positive evidence may include forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and any applicable tax planning strategies available to the Company. Negative evidence may include losses in recent years, if any, or the projection of losses in future periods. Estimating future taxable income requires numerous judgments and assumptions, including projections of future operating conditions which may be impacted by volatile future prices for our oil, natural gas and natural gas production, the expected timing and quantity of future production volumes, and the impact of our commodity derivative instruments on our income. \n\nIn 2022, management&#8217;s assessment of all available evidence, both positive and negative, supporting realizability of Viper&#8217;s deferred tax assets as required by applicable accounting standards, resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit of $50 million for the portion of Viper&#8217;s deferred tax assets considered more likely than not to be realized. The positive evidence assessed included recent cumulative income due in part to higher commodity prices and an expectation of future taxable income based upon recent actual and forecasted production volumes and prices. Viper retained a partial valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets due in part to potential future volatility in commodity prices impacting the likelihood of future realizability. As of December 31, 2022, Viper had a deferred tax asset of $148 million offset by an allowance of $98 \n\nTable of Contents \n\nmillion. The valuation allowance remains in place based on the uncertainty of future events, including Viper&#8217;s ability to generate future taxable income in excess of special allocations to be made to Diamondback, and management considered this and other factors in evaluating the realizability of Viper&#8217;s deferred tax assets. Any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if Viper&#8217;s deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future income, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the determination to record a valuation allowance on certain tax attributes acquired from QEP and certain state NOL carryforwards which the Company does not believe are realizable prior to expiration was based on an evaluation of available positive and negative evidence, including the annual limitation imposed by IRC Section 382 subsequent to an ownership change and the anticipated timing of reversal of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax liabilities in the applicable jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, our balance of taxable temporary differences anticipated to reverse within the carryforward period provides significant positive evidence for the determination that our remaining deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Any change in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if our deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future taxable income primarily related to the excess of book carrying value over tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on uncertain tax positions and assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. At December 31, 2022, our uncertain tax positions were insignificant, however, material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 2&#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, if any. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nSee Note 15&#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of our significant commitments and contingencies, some of which are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets under GAAP. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nOur major market risk exposure in our exploration and production business is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production. Pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years. Although demand and market prices for oil and natural gas have recently increased, we cannot predict events, including the outcome of the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, global supply chain disruptions, a potential economic downturn or recession, the COVID-19 pandemic, that may lead to future price volatility and the near term energy outlook remains subject to heightened levels of uncertainty. Further, the prices we receive for production depend on many other factors outside of our control. \n\nWe use derivatives, including swaps, basis swaps, swaptions, roll hedges, costless collars, puts and basis puts, to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had a net asset commodity derivative position of $153 million related to our commodity price derivatives. Utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our commodity price derivatives as of December 31, 2022, a 10% increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset position by $11 million to $164 million, while a 10% decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have reduced the net asset derivative position by $8 million to $145 million. However, any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase, respectively, in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument. \n\nFor additional information on our open commodity derivative instruments at December 31, 2022, see Note 12&#8212; Derivatives of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCounterparty and Customer Credit Risk \n\nOur principal exposures to credit risk are due to the concentration of receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $618 million at December 31, 2022), and to a lesser extent, receivables resulting from joint interest receivables (approximately $93 million at December 31, 2022). \n\nWe do not require our customers to post collateral, and the failure or inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us due to their liquidity issues, bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. \n\nJoint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill. We have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities and changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by Diamondback E&#38;P. At December 31, 2022, the applicable margin ranges from 0.125% to 1.000% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate, and from 1.125% to 2.000% per annum in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case based on the pricing level. The pricing level depends on certain rating agencies&#8217; ratings of our long-term senior unsecure debt. We believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material near-term impact on our future earnings or cash flows. For additional information on our variable interest rate debt at December 31, 2022, see Note 8&#8212; Debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\nHistorically, we have at times used interest rates swaps to manage our exposure to (i) interest rate changes on our floating-rate date and (ii) fair value changes on our fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2022, we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $1.2 billion to manage the impact of changes to the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes due to changes in market interest rates through December 2029. We pay an average variable rate of interest for these swaps based on three month LIBOR plus 2.1865% and receive a fixed interest rate of 3.50% from our counterparties. At December 31, 2022, our receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps were in a net liability position of $193 million, and the weighted average variable rate was 5.97%. For additional information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 12&#8212; Derivatives of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\n"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures \n\nUnder the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have established disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework, management did not identify any material weaknesses in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting and determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nGrant Thornton LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, is included in this Item under the heading &#8220;Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.&#8221; \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders \n\nDiamondback Energy, Inc. \n\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by COSO. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \n\nBasis for opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP \n\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\n"
