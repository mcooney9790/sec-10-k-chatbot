Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. \n\nThe bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny over cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. \n\nINFORMATION RELATED TO BUSINESS SEGMENTS \n\nOur chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;). The CEO is responsible for performance assessment and resource allocation. The CEO regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable segment and uses this information to assess performance and allocate resources. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, &#8220;Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; of this Annual Report. \n\nHEALTHCARE SEGMENT \n\nDescription of Busi ness.

We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and internationally. The principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, and plastic components. These raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities. However, in fiscal 2022 and 2023 we experienced delays in receiving materials and significant cost increases. We do not currently expect any significant disruption to our operations due to sourcing problems in fiscal 2024. We have long-term supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers, or those that are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as ethylene oxide (\"EO\") and cobalt-60, which are necessary to our AST operations. In addition, we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with accelerator-based technologies, which may reduce the potential supply risk. \n\nIn response to the active conflict between Russian and Ukraine, we stopped purchasing cobalt-60 from our Russian supplier. A long-term disruption in cobalt-60 sourced from Russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our AST operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our AST segment and its results of operations. For additional information about the risks we face concerning the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, see Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report titled, \"Risk Factors.\" \n\nInflation. Historically, our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation. However during fiscal 2022 and 2023, we experienced a rise in supply chain and labor costs and anticipate continued inflationary pressure in fiscal 2024 . We monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation. \n\nIntellectual Property. We protect our technology and products by, among other means, obtaining United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service, or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our co mpetitive position. \n\nAs of March 31, 2023, we held 581 United States patents and 2,356 patents in other jurisdictions and had 159 United States patent applications and 372 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained. The actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in each country. \n\nOur products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks. We consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products. As of March 31, 2023, we had a total of approximately 2,482 trademark registrations worldwide. \n\nQuality Assurance. We manufacture, assemble, and package products in several countries. Each of our production facilities are dedicated to particular processes and products. Our success depends upon Customer confidence in the quality of our production process and the integrity of the data that supports our product safety and effectiveness. We have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes. \n\nGovernment Regulation. Our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (&#8220;NRC&#8221;), and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and services. Our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation, including country-specific rules and regulations and U.S. regulations applicable to our international operations. Government regulations require detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and development, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, sampling, distribution, record-keeping, storage, and disposal practices. \n\nCompliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us. Past, current or future regulations, their interpretation, or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Also, additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent, delay, revoke, or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products. We cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations. \n\nIf we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, penalties could be imposed on us. For more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements, see Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report titled, \"Risk Factors.\" We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value. \n\nIn the past, we have received warning letters, paid civil penalties, conducted product recalls and field corrections, and been subject to other regulatory penalties. We believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance, results, or financial condition. \n\nEnvironmental Matters. We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in Ireland, the United States and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements in all material respects. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition. Please refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for further information. \n\nIn the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition. \n\nCompetition. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated. Competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors. Brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support are important competitive factors to us. We expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. We believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents. \n\nWe believe that our long-term competitive position depends on our success in discovering, developing, and marketing innovative, cost-effective products and services. We devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe STERIS is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations. In addition to research and development, we invest in quality control, Customer training programs, distribution systems, technical services, and other information services. \n\nThere can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services, or that the new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors. In addition, some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us. Therefore, a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do. Competition, as it relates to our business segments and product categories, is discussed in more detail in the section above titled, &#8220;Information Related to Business Segments.&#8221; \n\nMethods of Distribution. Sales and service activities are supported by a staff of regionally based clinical specialists, system planners, corporate account managers, and in-house Customer service and field support departments. We also contract with distributors and dealers. \n\nCustomer training is important to our business. We provide a variety of courses at Customer locations, at our training and education centers, and over the internet. Our training programs help Customers understand the science, technology, and operation of our products and services. Many of our operator training programs are approved by professional certifying organizations and offer continuing education credits to eligible course participants. \n\nSeasonality. Our financial results have been, from time to time, subject to seasonal patterns. We cannot assure you that these patterns will not continue. \n\nBacklog. We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. At March 31, 2023, we had a backlog of $599.6 million. Of this amount, $494.7 million and $104.9 million related to our Healthcare and Life Sciences segments, respectively. At March 31, 2022, excluding Cantel, we had backlog orders of $528.3 million. Of this amount, $423.6 million and $104.7 million related to our Healthcare and Life Sciences segments, respectively. \n\nAvailability of Securities and Exchange Commission Filings. We make available free of charge on or through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). You may access these documents, as well as other SEC filings related to the Company, on the Investor Relations page of our website at http://www.steris-ir.com . You may also obtain copies of these documents by accessing the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov . The content on or accessible through any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K unless expressly noted. \n\nWe also make available free of charge on our website our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Director Code of Ethics, and our Code of Business Conduct, as well as the Charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Organization Development Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee, and the Compliance Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE \n\nIntroduction \n\nWE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare, life sciences and dental products and services. Inspired by our Customers&#8217; efforts to create a healthier and safer world, and guided by our legacy of leadership and innovation, we strive to be a Great Company. To STERIS, this means we will make a difference by providing world-class products and services for our Customers, safe and rewarding work for our People, and superior returns for our Shareholders. \n\nWe have an Enterprise Risk Management process (\"ERM\") to manage risk, which is led by our Chief Compliance Officer. Identifying and managing key risks to our business operations are essential to our future growth, profitability, and successful execution of strategic plans. We are committed to understanding and managing these risks through a consistent approach to risk assessment, monitoring, reporting, and mitigation. Key management sponsors are responsible for participating in the risk assessment process, including a periodic review with the Board of Directors. The objective of ERM is to identify key risks, the potential impacts of compliance failure, identify key mitigating activities, develop potential improvements for managing the risks, and to ensure execution of oversight activities on a monthly, annual or as needed basis. \n\nOur Environmental, Social, and Governance (\"ESG\") function is led by the Vice President of ESG. The ESG function, with support from our Chief Executive Officer, General Counsel and other senior executives, works to actively develop and refine our ESG strategies, programs, and policies. The ESG function works closely with our Global Sustainability Steering Committee to build ESG values and implement strategies, programs, and policies across the Company. The Global Sustainability Steering Committee is a cross-functional team of senior leadership, subcommittee chairs, and subject matter experts spanning our businesses and Legal, Investor Relations, Human Resources, Continuous Improvement, Compliance, Facilities, and Health, Safety and Environment functions. The ESG team regularly updates the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors regarding its activities, including evaluating carbon emissions, preparing for regulatory requirements, reporting ESG metrics, and reviewing ESG ratings. \n\nKey performance indicators and metrics have been established for those areas we believe to be relevant and potentially significant to our business. Certain of these disclosures relate to Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards for Medical Equipment &#38; Supplies that we have identified to be closely aligned with our business. Our reporting against the SASB Standards is a voluntary disclosure aligned with our focus on financial materiality. We seek to provide investors with useful, relevant and meaningful sustainability information and have selected metrics under the SASB Standards. We describe below how we continuously monitor and track our policies and activities in the areas of ethical business practices, energy and environmental conservation, employees and human capital management, and quality. \n\nETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES \n\nCode of Business Conduct. Our Code of Business Conduct sets the standard for legal and ethical behavior, addressing topics such as bribery and corruption, supply chain transparency, proper behavior in the workplace, and avoiding conflicts of interest. \n\nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption. We are committed to conducting our business fairly, honorably, with integrity and in compliance with the law in all jurisdictions where we operate. Our policy prohibits bribery and corruption in any form, and we explain our commitment in our Statement on Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures. As an ongoing due diligence measure, we have established a program to recognize those sales and marketing intermediaries who demonstrate an elevated commitment to compliance. Through this Commercial Compliance Program, we formally recognize organizations that have not only met STERIS's standard ethical requirements for inclusion in our network but have also taken additional steps, such as adopting their own code of conduct and training their employees on their own firm's ethical values, to ensure compliant behavior. In 2023, STERIS incurred no monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with bribery or corruption. \n\nSupplier Code of Conduct. Our expectations for ethical behavior extend beyond STERIS to our Suppliers as well. Our Supplier Code of Conduct defines the minimum requirements and expectations for all Suppliers and their subcontractors. We have mechanisms in place to identify when suppliers do not meet our Supplier Code of Conduct requirements. Suspicions of \n\nsupplier non-compliance are promptly investigated and addressed. We believe in conducting business with integrity and honesty and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. We expect our suppliers to comply with the laws of the countries in which they operate, including but not limited to the European Union Customs Code, the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the UK Modern Slavery Act, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, the US Dodd-Frank Conflict Minerals Rules, applicable data privacy laws, and all applicable local labor and employment laws. \n\nConflict Minerals Sourcing Policy . We file reports with the SEC disclosing our use of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (\"conflict minerals\" or \"3TG\") in products sold anywhere in the world. In accordance with these legal requirements and as a part of the overall commitment to responsible sourcing, we are working with our suppliers to ensure transparency to the smelter/refining source for 3TG materials used in our products. Furthermore, we seek to identify the countries of origin of the 3TG in our products and the smelter/refiners that process the 3TG in our products. We undertake this effort to promote responsible sourcing. Because of our general downstream position in the supply chain, we rely on our suppliers for information. We expect suppliers to respond to our requests for complete transparency about the sources whose 3TG materials are used in our products and to conduct due diligence measures to ensure the information provided is accurate, up-to-date and complete. This Policy applies to all suppliers of products and materials to the Company and to all our affiliates. We will consider taking various progressive actions with respect to suppliers who do not make reasonable efforts to cooperate with our requests for information or requests to take corrective actions to enable us to identify smelters and refiners in our supply chains. \n\nRisks and Prevention . We regularly assess the risks associated with our business, including the risk of potential corruption or bribery in the environments where we do business, and we have designed our management systems to respond accordingly. As part of our anti-corruption program, our employees and third-party intermediaries are subject to mandatory comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption training online and in-person. The training covers the various forms that corruption can take, red flags, and individuals&#8217; roles in our anti-bribery and anti-corruption efforts. \n\nIn accordance with our policy, we engage a third-party due diligence firm to perform background checks, including bribery and corruption, before entering into commercial relationships with sales and marketing intermediaries, and other service providers. \n\nWe communicate our bribery and corruption policies and expectations to our officers, Directors, employees, dealers, distributors and agents. It is the expectation of the Company that all of the aforementioned individuals comply with the requirements set forth in our policy and relevant rules and regulations. \n\nManaging Compliance and Ethics . We require all employees to be lawful and ethically responsible in all business practices. We expect all employees to comply with all Company policies, applicable laws, and the principles outlined in our Code of Business Conduct. \n\nSenior members of STERIS&#8217;s leadership team are involved in numerous industry associations that focus on setting the standards and driving change. We hold seats and actively participate on the Boards of AdvaMed and the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (\"MDMA\"). We are also an active member of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (\"AAMI\") and MedTech Europe. AdvaMed has roughly 400 member companies and promotes policies that foster the highest ethical standards, timely patient access to safe and effective products, and economic policies that reward value creation. The AdvaMed Code of Ethics on Interactions with Health Care Professionals (\"AdvaMed Code\") facilitates ethical interactions between MedTech companies and health care professionals to ensure that medical decisions are based on the best interests of the patient. STERIS has adopted and requires compliance with the AdvaMed Code. \n\nMDMA is the leading voice representing the interests of innovative and entrepreneurial medical technology companies. MDMA's goal is to provide patients and clinicians with timely access to safe and effective medical technologies that improve the quality of life. AAMI is a nonprofit organization founded in 1967. It is a diverse community of more than 10,000 healthcare technology professionals united by one important mission-supporting the healthcare community in the development, management, and use of safe and effective healthcare technology. MedTech Europe is the European trade association for the medical technology industry including diagnostics, medical devices and digital health. MedTech Europe&#8217;s purpose is to make innovative medical technology available to more people, while helping healthcare systems move towards a more sustainable path. The MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice regulates all aspects of the industry&#8217;s relationship with Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and Healthcare Organizations (HCOs), to ensure that all interactions are ethical and professional at all times and to maintain the trust of regulators, and patients. STERIS has adopted and requires compliance with the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice. \n\nUsing the STERIS Integrity Helpline or Webline, employees can anonymously report potential Code of Conduct concerns. A management Ethics Committee meets monthly to monitor and investigate reports of Code of Business Conduct violations and provides quarterly reporting to the Board of Director's Compliance and Technology Committee. With respect to financial matters, reports are provided to the Board of Director&#8217;s Audit Committee. \n\nThe STERIS Code of Business Conduct covers ethical marketing and off-label promotion. In fiscal 2023, STERIS incurred no monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with false marketing claims. \n\nENERGY, GHG EMISSIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION \n\nWe are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in Ireland, the United States and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. Our Continuous Improvement objectives include efforts to improve energy and water efficiency and reduce or eliminate certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, our operations thereby reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. \n\nSTERIS tracks greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and we complete the annual Carbon Disclosure Project (\"CDP\") questionnaire. CDP is an internationally recognized nonprofit organization that collects and reports environmental metrics. Currently, we report our direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) energy use and emissions from all legacy STERIS facilities. In fiscal 2023, we completed an energy assessment of our global operations to identify opportunities for reducing our global GHG emissions and evaluate potential target setting opportunities. We recognize that a significant portion of our carbon impact is as a result of our value chain, outside of electricity and energy consumption at our global sites. More recently, we initiated a comprehensive review to establish the baseline for our Scope 3 carbon emissions. \n\nWe have a broad and comprehensive portfolio of sterilization and disinfection products that support the procedural spaces within hospitals, endoscopy and surgery centers as well as pharmaceutical, medical device and dental Customers. When we think about new products or next generation products, part of our effort is to reduce the environmental impact of what we do. That can include anything from reformulating chemistries to eliminating metals-based ingredients or reducing the effluence produced as a result of the use of our products, to creating ultra-concentrate chemistries such as Prolystica&#174; Ultra Concentrate Cleaning Chemistries, which offer 10x the uses per container. That means 5 and 10-liter containers of concentrate replace 114-liter drums, creating benefits from safer lifting, elimination of packaging waste, and less frequent deliveries with smaller trucks. We also work to utilize containers that can be recycled and build products with materials that can be recycled at the end of their life. \n\nWe are actively evaluating our ability to report in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and in light of evolving regulatory disclosure requirements. \n\nRisks and Prevention. We actively monitor and take steps to manage the risks associated with environmental matters, none of which we consider material at this time. \n\nEMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \n\nStrategy and Overview. People are the key to our success, which is reflected in our two core values of people and teamwork. We are committed to the safety and success of our people. We expect the performance of every person to continually improve with personal initiative and proper support. We expect our people to treat each other with mutual respect. Our ideal business team is engaged, diverse, inclusive and talented, and we create programs and policies in support of these goals. \n\nWe believe unity of purpose and teamwork enables us to do far more than we could individually. We draw strength from each other and encourage communication with fairness, candor, respect and courage. Our collaboration turns interesting ideas into great products and services for our Customers. \n\nOur senior management team and Board receive regular updates on our people, including data and metrics on retention, engagement and safety which are used to determine our human resources priorities, programs and training. \n\nWe are committed to upholding human rights in all our operations globally and respect human rights as recognized by the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We strongly oppose all forms of slavery, servitude, forced labor, child labor and human trafficking. \n\nEmployees by Segment. As of March 31, 2023, we had over 17,000 employees throughout the world of which less than 12% are represented by work councils or labor unions. We believe we generally have good relations with our employees. \n\nThe average number of persons employed by STERIS plc and its subsidiaries during each of the following fiscal years was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Healthcare 10,629 10,546 Applied Sterilization Technologies 3,163 2,961 Life Sciences 965 1,111 Dental 1,451 1,020 Corporate 892 784 Total employees 17,100 16,422 ##TABLE_END \n\nDiversity, Equity &#38; Inclusion (DE&#38;I). We are dedicated to creating and sustaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. W e believe that the different ideas, experiences, perspectives and backgrounds of our global employees create a \n\nstronger organization that allows us to fulfill our ultimate goal of serving our Customers. To put it simply, we believe a diverse and inclusive workforce is essential to a thriving organization. \n\nWe strive to recruit the best available people who are aligned with and embody our core values. We are committed to equality and assessing candidates based on qualifications. We believe that our success is dependent on attracting and retaining people from a cross-section of our communities who understand their markets, and in doing so we continue to create a competitive advantage for STERIS. \n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and we do so without regard to race, color, social or economic status, religion, national origin, marital status, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any protected status. It is the policy of the Company to make all decisions regarding employment, including hiring, compensation, training, promotions, transfers, or lay-offs, based on the job requirements and skills of the individuals and utilizing the principle of equal employment opportunity without discrimination. We have biennial training on anti-harassment, except where required annually. \n\nTotal directors and employee&#8217;s distribution by gender is shown in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Male Female Male Female Non-Executive Directors 6 2 6 2 Senior Managers 739 297 663 236 Other employees of the Company 10,774 5,846 10,294 5,629 ##TABLE_END\n\nDirectors and United States employees by race is shown in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 White Minority (1) \n\nWhite Minority (1) \n\nNon-Executive Directors 75% 25% 75% 25% Senior Managers 86% 14% 88% 12% Other employees of the Company 61% 39% 63% 37% ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) A minority person is defined as a person who identifies as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Island, or two or more races. \n\nHealth, Safety &#38; Environment. We realize the importance of Health, Safety &#38; Environment (\"HSE\") to the well-being of our Customers, employees, community, the environment, and ultimately our shareholders. To that end, our HSE teams and management are committed to supporting HSE programs with ongoing involvement through our continuous improvement process. Our ultimate goal is to be an incident-free company. The cornerstone of this initiative is the belief that incidents result from unsafe acts or conditions, both of which are preventable. We apply the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordkeeping practices worldwide. Key metrics for purposes of benchmarking performance include Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR\") and Lost-time Incident Rate (\"LTIR\") injury and illness incident rates, both of which are presented in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START STERIS Industry Benchmarks (2) \n\nFiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Average Best in Class Total Recordable Incident Rate (1) \n\n1.05 0.85 2.50 1.43 Lost-time Incident Rate (1) \n\n0.36 0.24 1.25 0.32 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1 ) We apply the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") recordkeeping practices worldwide. All rates are based on 100 full-time employees (\"FTE\") working one year. 100 FTEs equals 200,000 work hours. TRIR includes work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first-aid. LTIR includes work-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to be away from work at least one full day after the date of the incident. \n\n(2) Our external benchmarks include the OSHA average and 1st Quartile injury/illness rates which are derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\nOur annual workplace injury prevention results are within the manufacturing sector's best-in-class performance as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\nThe ISO 14001 and 45001 sets out the criteria that a company can follow to establish an effective HSE management system. Designed for any type of organization, regardless of its activity or sector, it can provide assurance that environmental impact is being measured, controlled and improved in a holistic manner. To date, one facility and 14 reprocessing locations have undergone the formal process to receive ISO 14001. \n\nThe OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (\"VPP\") Star Award recognizes employers who have implemented effective safety and health management systems and maintain injury and illness rates below national Bureau of Labor Statistics averages for their industry. We currently have 12 locations that hold the OSHA VPP Star Award. \n\nWe utilize internal HSE management systems and compliance audits designed to identify percent compliance of our global operations against our standards. \n\nEmployee Engagement and Development. We believe that engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and satisfied in their work. Examples of how we engage our employees include quarterly management meetings, a robust intranet for communication with our global teams and various communications efforts within each department. In addition, our global human resources team has programs focused on career development and training for employees at all levels. \n\nOur employee turnover rate was 15% and 17% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and we are continuously working towards a goal of achieving a rate of 10% or less, excluding retirements and reductions in force. Although reductions in force are sometimes necessary, we work to avoid them and they must always be approved by executive management. Every year we encourage all employees to participate in our employee engagement survey which is administered by a third party on a confidential basis. This process has been valuable in helping us recognize what we do well and foster an open conversation about how we can make STERIS an even better place to work. We are pleased to report that 85% of our employees completed our 2023 survey. In our most recent survey, we measured fifteen principal factors and overall employee engagement was 74%, in-line with our results for the past five years. The results indicate that the majority of our people are committed to serving our Customers, are proud to work for STERIS, and have confidence in the stability of our business. \n\nWe are committed to supporting the development of our people. Employees benefit from hands-on continuous improvement (\"Lean\") training, a web-based learning management system and STERIS University. In addition, we provide biennial Code of Conduct training and other key required training at all levels of the Company. In our manufacturing and service organizations, we provide training for employees who do not have the necessary experience or background. This training is conducted through a combination of hands-on and module-based training. Our focus is on safety, quality and consistency in approach and outcome. As a Lean focused organization, we have created standard work instructions for many processes and refresher courses are offered regularly for existing employees. Where possible, we look to provide cross-training for employees looking to expand their knowledge or grow into new roles. We encourage all employees to create individual development plans and provide the support to assist in that effort. \n\nCompensation and Benefits. Our total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support our employees' financial, physical, and mental well-being, including providing competitive salaries, variable performance pay, healthcare benefits, tuition assistance, paid time off, annual merit increases, and incentive plans based on the national norms of employees' employment. Total employee compensation is presented in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Wages and salaries $ 1,172,234 $ 1,100,357 Commission and incentive plans 154,840 225,863 Social security costs 91,653 65,525 Share-based compensation expense 38,951 57,660 Pension and post-retirement benefits expense 37,936 32,423 Other, primarily employee benefits 139,133 130,217 Total employee costs $ 1,634,747 $ 1,612,045 ##TABLE_END\n\nQUALITY \n\nWe are subject to strict regulatory compliance and quality standards to ensure the safety and supply of our products and services. The quality and regulatory systems are broad in scope and designed to achieve quality from incoming materials through the design, development, manufacture, storage, handling and distribution of our products and delivery of services. To monitor compliance with these standards, internal and third-party assessments of our quality and regulatory systems are conducted. FDA conducts inspections of our manufacturing and contract sterilization facilities on a periodic basis to confirm compliance. In connection with an inspection, the FDA may initiate warning letters and/or consent decrees, which list conditions or practices that may indicate a violation of the FDA&#8217;s requirements. In fiscal 2023, STERIS did not receive any warning letters, seizures, or consent decrees. Additionally, STERIS had zero products listed in the FDA&#8217;s MedWatch Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products database. \n\nWe have in place processes to monitor and support compliance with product and service regulations worldwide, including design controls, product changes, labeling and advertising, marketing materials, good manufacturing practices, and adverse event reporting requirements. We take prompt action whenever we are alerted to regulatory or field-safety issues with a STERIS product. Following immediate assessment, we take corrective action, including voluntary product recalls, when \n\nneeded. We examine underlying issues and root cause and work to resolve these to avoid recurrence. STERIS had no Class I recalls in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. \n\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS \n\nThe following table presents certain information regarding our executive officers at March 31, 2023.

      "section": "1A",
      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nThis section describes certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should consider these risk factors when evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, because our actual results and financial condition might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements should these risks occur. We face other risks besides those highlighted below. These other risks include additional uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, but may ultimately have a significant impact. In addition, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing inflationary environment may also exacerbate any of these risks, which could have a material effect on us. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. Should any of these risks, described below or otherwise, actually occur, our business, financial condition, performance, prospects, value, or results of operations could be negatively affected. \n\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKS \n\nDoing Business Internationally \n\nCompliance with multiple, and potentially conflicting, international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws, and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome or expensive. \n\nWe are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot assure you that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. \n\nChanges in economic climate may adversely affect us. \n\nAdverse economic cycles or conditions, and Customer, regulatory or government response to those cycles or conditions, have affected and could further affect our results of operations. The onset of these cycles or conditions may not be foreseeable and there can be no assurance when they will begin to improve after they occur. There also can be no assurance as to the strength or length of any recovery from a business downturn or recession. Credit and liquidity problems may make it difficult for some businesses to access credit markets and obtain financing and may cause some businesses to curtail spending to conserve cash in anticipation of persistent business slowdowns and liquidity needs. If our Customers have difficulty financing their purchases due to tight credit markets or related factors or because of other operational or utilization problems they may be experiencing or otherwise decide to curtail their purchases, our business could be adversely affected. Our exposure to bad debt losses could also increase if Customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and delivered. \n\nSome of our Customers are governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding. If government funding for healthcare becomes limited or restricted in countries in which we operate, including as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Customers may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full and it may become necessary to increase reserves. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in collection difficulties. Prospectively, additional adverse effects resulting from these conditions may include decreased healthcare utilization, further pricing pressure on our products and services, and/or weaker overall demand for our products and services, particularly capital products. \n\nThe effects of geopolitical instability, including as a result of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, may adversely affect us and create significant risks and uncertainties for our business, with the ultimate impact dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. \n\nOngoing geopolitical instability, including as a result of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, has negatively impacted, and could in the future negatively impact, the global and U.S. economies, including by causing supply chain disruptions, rising energy costs, volatility in capital markets and foreign currency exchange rates, rising interest rates and heightened cybersecurity risks. The extent to which such geopolitical instability adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity and capital profile, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. If geopolitical instability adversely affects us, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks related to our business. \n\nIn response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia. The long-term impact on our business resulting from the disruption of trade in the region caused by the conflict and associated sanctions and boycotts is uncertain at this time due to the fluid nature of the ongoing military conflict and response. The potential impacts include supply chain and logistics disruptions, financial impacts including volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates, increased inflationary pressure on raw materials and energy, and other risks, including an elevated risk of \n\ncybersecurity threats and the potential for further sanctions. We have stopped commercial operations in Russia and Belarus, which includes shipments to Customers and purchases of cobalt-60 from our Russian supplier. A long-term disruption in cobalt-60 sourced from Russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our AST operations. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if further significant disruptions occur. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors, disrupted our operations. We have experienced temporary mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Furthermore, we have experienced less demand for certain of our products and services as a result of reduced volume of medical procedures, and other factors, which we believe was exacerbated by the impact of stay-at-home orders and government responses to COVID-19. Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused temporary disruptions and rising costs in our labor supply and supply chain and distribution network. \n\nLong-term facility closures or other restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff, supply or otherwise maintain our operations. Such restrictions also may have a substantial impact on our Customers and our sales cycles. The COVID-19 pandemic may put pressure on overall spending for our products and services, and may cause our Customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions. Moreover, because a large number of our employees have been and will continue to work from home routinely, we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. We have modified, and may further modify, our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful. \n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration, severity and disruption to our business, Customers and supply chain, and the related financial impact to us, cannot be accurately forecasted at this time. Should such additional significant disruptions occur and continue for an extended period, the adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be more severe. Additionally, weak economic conditions, the pace for economic recovery, and rising inflation, could result in extended weak demand for our products and services. Furthermore, future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above. \n\nHealthcare Laws and Reimbursement \n\nChanges in healthcare laws or government and other third-party payor reimbursement levels to healthcare providers, or failure to meet healthcare reimbursement or other requirements, might negatively impact our business. \n\nWe sell many of our products and services to hospitals and other healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Many of these Customers are subject to or supported by government programs or receive reimbursement for services from third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., private insurance plans, and managed care programs. Reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Government-managed healthcare systems control reimbursement for healthcare services in many countries. Public budgetary constraints may significantly impact the ability of hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other Customers supported by such systems to purchase our products. Government or other third-party payors may deny or change coverage, reduce their current levels of reimbursement for healthcare services, or otherwise implement measures to regulate pricing or contain costs. In addition, our costs may increase more rapidly than reimbursement levels or permissible pricing increases or we may not satisfy the standards or requirements for reimbursement. \n\nVarious additional health care reform proposals have emerged at the federal and state level, and we are unable to predict which, if any, of those proposals will be enacted. \n\nProduct and Service Related Regulations and Claims \n\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may negatively impact our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value. \n\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation in the countries where we do business. In the United States, our products and services are regulated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In many foreign countries, sales of our products and services are subject to extensive regulations that may or may not be comparable to those of the FDA. In Europe, our products are regulated primarily by country and community regulations of those countries within the European Economic Area and must conform to the requirements of those authorities. \n\nGovernment regulation applies to nearly all aspects of testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, reporting, promoting, distributing, and importing or exporting of medical devices, products, and services. In general, unless an exemption applies, a sterilization, decontamination or medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold. Modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals, approval supplements or clearances. If there are delays in and/or we are unable to obtain any required approvals, approval supplements or clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device, we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale, or recall or restrict the use of such modified device, pay fines, or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained. Any elongation or de-prioritization or delay in regulatory review could materially affect our ongoing device design, development, and commercialization plans. \n\nRegulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance, or review and disagree with our interpretation of approvals or clearances, or with our decision that regulatory approval is not required or has been maintained. Regulatory submissions may require the provision of additional data and may be time consuming and costly, and their outcome is uncertain. Regulatory agencies may also change policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of devices, or could impact our ability to market a previously cleared, approved, or unregulated device. Our failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or elsewhere might subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions. These sanctions include, among others, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, loss of tax benefits, injunctions, product seizure, recalls, suspensions or restrictions, re-labeling, detention, and/or debarment. \n\nOur products are subject to recalls and restrictions, even after receiving United States or foreign regulatory clearance or approval. \n\nOngoing medical device reporting regulations require that we report to appropriate governmental authorities in the United States and/or other countries when our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Governmental authorities can require product recalls or impose restrictions for product design, manufacturing, labeling, clearance, or other issues. For the same reasons, we may voluntarily elect to recall or restrict the use of a product. Any recall or restriction could divert managerial and financial resources and might harm our reputation among our Customers and other healthcare professionals who use or recommend our products and services. \n\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims or other legal actions or regulatory or compliance matters . \n\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions. A significant increase in the number, severity, amount, or scope of these claims and actions may, as described above with respect to recalls and restrictions, result in substantial costs and harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect product sales and our business. Product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions may also distract management from other business responsibilities. \n\nWe are also subject to a variety of other types of claims, proceedings, investigations, and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties and other potential risks and liabilities. These include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims regarding promotion of our products and services, or other similar or different matters. Any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business. \n\nAdministratively or judicially imposed or agreed sanctions might include warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, loss of tax benefits, injunctions, product seizure, recalls, suspensions or restrictions, re-labeling, detention, and/or debarment. We also might be required to take actions such as payment of substantial amounts, or revision of financial statements, or to take, or be subject to, the following types of actions with respect to our products, services, or business: redesign, re-label, restrict, or recall products; cease manufacturing and selling products; seizure of product inventory; comply with a court injunction restricting or prohibiting further marketing and sale of products or services; comply with a consent decree, which could result in further regulatory constraints; dedication of significant internal and external resources and costs to respond to and comply with legal and regulatory issues and constraints; respond to claims, litigation, and other proceedings brought by Customers, users, governmental agencies, and others; disruption of product improvements and product launches; discontinuation of certain product lines or services; or other restrictions or limitations on product sales, use or operation, or other activities or business practices. \n\nSome product replacements or substitutions may not be possible or may be prohibitively costly or time consuming. The impact of any legal, regulatory, or compliance claims, proceeding, investigation, or litigation, is difficult to predict. \n\nWe maintain product liability and other insurance with coverages believed to be adequate. However, product liability or other claims may exceed insurance coverage limits, fines, penalties and regulatory sanctions may not be covered by insurance, or insurance may not continue to be available or available on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, our insurers might deny claim coverage for valid or other reasons or may become insolvent. \n\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected by difficulties in acquiring or maintaining a proprietary intellectual ownership position. \n\nTo maintain our competitive position for our products, we need to obtain patent or other proprietary rights for new and improved products and to maintain and enforce our existing patents and other proprietary rights. We typically apply for patents in the United States and in strategic other countries. We may also acquire patents through acquisitions. We may encounter difficulties in obtaining or protecting patents. \n\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. These measures afford only limited protection, and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Litigation may also be brought against us claiming that we have violated the intellectual property rights of others. Litigation may be costly and may divert management&#8217;s attention from other matters. Additionally, in some foreign countries with weaker intellectual property rights, it may be difficult to maintain and enforce patents and other proprietary rights or defend against claims of infringement. \n\nTax Risks \n\nWe might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions. \n\nWe are subject to the tax laws at the federal, state or provincial, and local government levels in the many jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services. Tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate and cash flow. The tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us. Our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities, we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges, and we might be unsuccessful in those efforts. Developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations. \n\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. \n\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;TCJA&#8221;) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Guidance continues to be issued clarifying the application of this new legislation and new changes have been proposed, and in many instances finalized, with respect to a number of income tax provisions (including foreign tax credit regulations) in the U.S. that could increase our total tax expense. In addition, beginning January 1, 2022, the limitation on deductibility of interest expense, which generally limits a deduction for interest expense to 30% of taxable income (subject to certain adjustments), must be determined by reducing taxable income by depreciation and amortization deductions, which may limit our ability to deduct interest expense in the future. We cannot predict the overall impact that the additional guidance and recent changes may have on our business. Some jurisdictions have raised tax rates and it is reasonable to expect that other global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the TCJA, current economic conditions, and COVID-19 response costs. \n\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) into law. One of the provisions in the IRA added a corporate alternative minimum tax (&#8220;CAMT&#8221;) to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), beginning for fiscal years 2023. If income tax liability in the U.S. is lower than the income tax liability calculated under the CAMT provisions, we will be subject to additional income taxes in the United States. In addition, the IRS added excise tax on certain stock buybacks by publicly traded corporations. Even though the excise tax mostly impacts publicly traded companies organized in the U.S., under certain circumstances, the excise tax may be imposed on stock buybacks by a non-U.S. based publicly traded company like us. \n\nIn addition, further changes in the tax laws of other jurisdictions will likely arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (B EPS) project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. Following the issuance of such recommendation, in December 2022, the European Union issued a directive to adopt Global Base Erosion laws (a/k/a GloBE or Pillar Two) in the EU member countries, in most cases beginning in fiscal year 2024. Many other non-EU member countries agreed to adopt GloBE between fiscal years 2024 and 2025. The GloBE rules, once implemented in the EU and other jurisdictions, could subject us to additional income taxes in those jurisdictions if our effective corporate tax rate in those \n\njurisdictions (determined under the GloBE rules) is below 15%. Accordingly, the GloBE rules could increase tax uncertainty and adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, the GloBE rules have certain transition period provisions that apply to certain intercompany transactions occurring between December 1, 2021 and the effective date of the GloBE rules in a given jurisdiction. These transition period provisions may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, and subject us to additional income tax, in some of the jurisdictions who adopt the GloBE rules. \n\nOur tax rate is uncertain and may vary from expectations, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share. \n\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any particular worldwide effective corporate tax rate. We cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations, and such variance may be material. Additionally, tax laws or their implementation and applicable tax authority practices in any particular jurisdiction could change in the future, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could have a material adverse impact on us and our affiliates. In addition, the GloBE rules, which are expected to be implemented in most of the jurisdictions where we have operations, and the CAMT may adversely impact our effective corporate tax rate. \n\nChanges in tax treaties and trade agreements could negatively impact our costs, results of operations and earnings per share. \n\nLegislative and regulatory action may be taken in the U.S. which, if ultimately adopted, could override or otherwise adversely impact tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which STERIS plc would be considered a U.S. resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our tax obligations. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals. However, if proposals were adopted that had the effect of disregarding our organization in Ireland or limiting our ability as an Irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the U.S., we could be subject to increased taxation and/or potentially significant expense. \n\nOn June 7, 2017, several countries, including many countries that we operate and have subsidiaries in, adopted the OECD&#8217;s Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the \"MLI\"), which generally is meant to prevent treaty abuse, improve dispute resolution, prevent the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status and neutralize the effect of hybrid mismatch agreements. The MLI came into effect on July 1, 2018. The MLI may modify affected tax treaties making it more difficult for us to obtain advantageous tax-treaty benefits. The number of affected tax treaties could eventually be significant. To date, about 100 jurisdictions have joined the BEPS MLI, out of which about 79 jurisdictions have ratified, accepted, or approved the MLI, and it covers around 1850 bilateral tax treaties. Signatories include jurisdictions from all continents and all levels of development and other jurisdictions are also actively working towards signature. As a result, our income may be taxed in jurisdictions where it is not currently taxed and at higher rates than it is currently taxed, which may increase our effective tax rate. \n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws and regulations or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. \n\nProposed legislation relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business. \n\nVarious U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to redomiciled companies may adversely affect us if adopted into law. We are unable to predict the likelihood that any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments or increased regulatory scrutiny could have on our business. \n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) may not agree that we are a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. \n\nAlthough we are organized under the laws of Ireland and are a tax resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code (&#8220;Section 7874&#8221;). For U.S. federal tax purposes, a company generally is considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization. Because we are organized under the laws of Ireland, we would generally be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874, however, provides an exception to this general rule under which a non-U.S. organized entity may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. \n\nIf we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantial additional U.S. tax liability. Additionally, if we were treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, non-U.S. holders of our ordinary shares would be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we paid to such shareholders. For Irish tax purposes, we are expected, regardless of any application of Section 7874, to be treated as an Ireland tax resident. Consequently, if we are treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under Section 7874, we could be liable for both U.S. and Ireland taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS \n\nOur businesses are highly competitive, and if we fail to compete successfully, our revenues and results of operations may be hurt . \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive global environment. Our businesses compete with other broad-line manufacturers, as well as many smaller businesses specializing in particular products or services, primarily on the basis of brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support. We face increased competition from new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, surgical support, cleaning consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, contract sterilization, and other products and services entering the market. Competitors and potential competitors also are attempting to develop alternate technologies and sterilizing agents, as well as disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination. \n\nConsolidations among our healthcare and pharmaceutical Customers may result in a loss of Customers or more significant pricing pressures . \n\nA number of our Customers have consolidated. These consolidations are due in part to healthcare cost reduction measures initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. This may result in greater pricing pressures on us and in some cases loss of Customers. Additional consolidations could result in a loss of Customers or more significant pricing pressures. \n\nDecreased availability or increased costs of raw materials or energy supplies or other supplies might increase our production costs or limit our production capabilities or curtail our operations. \n\nWe purchase raw materials, fabricated and other components, and energy supplies from a variety of suppliers. Key raw materials include stainless steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, cobalt-60 and EO, and key components include plastic components, as well as various electronics including control boards and computer chips. The availability and prices of raw materials and energy supplies are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Also, certain of our key materials and components have a limited number of suppliers. Some are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as cobalt-60 and EO, which are necessary to our AST operations. Changes in regulatory requirements regarding the use of, the unavailability or short supply of these products might disrupt or cause shutdowns of portions of our AST operations or have other adverse consequences. Shortages in supply, increased regulatory or security requirements, or increases in the price of raw materials, components and energy supplies may adversely affe ct us. In response to the active conflict between Russian and Ukraine, we have stopped purchasing cobalt-60 from our Russian supplier. A long-term disruption in cobalt-60 sourced from Russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our AST operations. \n\nOur operations, and those of our suppliers, are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks, any of which could interrupt production or operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance, results, or value. \n\nBusiness continuity hazards and other risks include: explosions, fires, earthquakes, public health crises, inclement weather, and other disasters; utility or other mechanical failures; unscheduled downtime; labor difficulties; inability to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits; disruption of communications; data security, preservation and redundancy disruptions; inability to hire or retain key management or employees; disruption of supply or distribution; and regulation of the safety, security or other aspects of our operations. \n\nThe occurrence of these types of events has disrupted and may in the future disrupt or shut down operations, or otherwise adversely impact the production or profitability of a particular facility, or our operations as a whole. Certain casualties also might cause personal injury and loss of life, or severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and for casualties occurring at our facilities, result in liability claims against us. Although we maintain property and casualty insurance and liability and similar insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for our industries, our insurance coverages have limits and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. \n\nExpectations relating to ESG considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, Customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our ESG priorities and initiatives through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these ESG considerations and implementation of these initiatives involves risks and uncertainties requires investments and is impacted by factors that may be outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our priorities and initiatives and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders also may have very different views on where ESG focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international ESG laws and regulations or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nAs we continue to focus on developing our ESG practices, such practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes. Many of our Customers are also committing to long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their supply chains. If we are unable to support Customers in achieving these reductions, we may lose revenue if our Customers find other suppliers who are better able to support such reductions. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to expectations of all key stakeholders could cause harm to our business and reputation and have a negative impact on the market price of our ordinary shares. Further, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment or voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to negative investor sentiment toward us and/or our industry, which could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital. \n\nWe may be adversely affected by global climate change or by existing and future legal, regulatory or market responses to such change. \n\nThe long-term effects of climate change are difficult to assess and predict. The impacts may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) and other adverse effects. The effects could impair, for example, the availability and cost of certain products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. We may bear losses as a result of, for example, physical damage to or destruction of our facilities (such as distribution or fulfillment centers), loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position or results of operation. \n\nThere has also been an increased focus from regulators and stakeholders on greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks. Both the standard setting and regulatory landscapes are extremely complex and present significant compliance challenges. Many different organizations are promulgating reporting standards and rules that focus on addressing greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related topics. In March 2022, the SEC published its proposed rule, &#8220;The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,&#8221; which sets forth certain prescriptive rules that, if implemented as proposed, will significantly increase our reporting obligations and cost of compliance. On January 5, 2023, the European Commission&#8217;s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (&#8220;CSRD&#8221;) became effective. The CSRD expands the number of companies required to publicly report ESG-related information and defines the ESG-related information that companies are required to report in accordance with European Sustainability Reporting Standards (&#8220;ESRS&#8221;). While CSRD rules are prescriptive for the types of data to be reported, the standards to quantify and qualify such data are still developing and uncertain, and may impose increased costs on us related to complying with our reporting obligations and increase risks of non-compliance with ESRS and the CSRD. \n\nOur operations are subject to regulations and permitting, which may be changed or amended by the relevant authorities, and which may limit or eliminate our current operations or increase the complexity, burden, or expense of compliance and regulated materials or processes that we use in our operations may become the focus of litigation. \n\nOur AST segment is a technology-neutral contract sterilization service that offers our Customers a wide range of sterilization modalities through a worldwide network of over 50 contract sterilization and laboratory facilities. One of the modalities offered by our AST operations is ethylene oxide (EO) sterilization. In the United States, several regulators, including the EPA, FDA, and agencies at the state and local level, play a role in regulating the use of EO sterilization. In 2016, the EPA changed the cancer risk basis for EO and determined that EO is carcinogenic to humans. Recent announcements of the temporary or permanent closure of EO sterilization facilities operated by others have been associated with state and/or local regulatory or other legal action related to EO emissions at those facilities. Our AST operations have taken and will continue to take measures to comply with all applicable emissions regulations and to reduce emissions. However, no assurance can be given that current or future legislative or regulatory action, or current or future litigation to which we are or may become a \n\nparty, will not significantly increase the costs of conducting our EO contract sterilization operations or curtail or eliminate the use of EO in our contract sterilization operations. A significant reduction in our EO contract sterilization activities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we could be liable for damages and fines as a result of legislative or regulatory action or litigation, and any liability could exceed our insurance and indemnification coverage, if any, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, for many medical devices, EO sterilization may be the only current method of sterilization that effectively sterilizes and does not damage the device during the sterilization process. In the event of regulatory, legislative, or legal action that curtails or eliminates EO sterilization, there could be a shortage of medical devices and consequently a decline in surgical procedures. A decline in surgical procedures could result in a decline in demand for the products and services provided by our Healthcare business, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur EO sterilization operations subject us to claims of liability and associated adverse effects . \n\nSome current or past operators of EO sterilization facilities, including us, have been the target of litigation on behalf of private plaintiffs alleging personal and other injuries as a result of exposure to emissions from such facilities. Certain of those operators have experienced adverse judgments and entered into settlements. These developments may increase the likelihood that we will continue to be subject to these claims or that we will be subject to more claims on behalf of similar plaintiffs in the future. Although we believe we have valid defenses to such claims, there can be no assurance that we will prevail on the merits, as the outcome of trials before juries and other aspects of litigation can be highly unpredictable. \n\nThe financial impact of litigation, particularly mass tort action lawsuits, is also difficult to predict and a judgment entered or settlement reached in one case is not representative of the outcome of other comparable cases. Regardless of the merits of the claims at issue or the ultimate outcome of a case, any litigation related to our EO operations could be costly to defend, could result in an increase of our insurance premiums, and could exhaust available insurance coverage. Furthermore, defense of litigation may result in diversion of management attention from other priorities, which could have a material adverse effect. \n\nIf our continuing efforts to create a lean business and in-source production to reduce costs are not successful, our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected . \n\nWe have undertaken various activities to incorporate lean concepts and practices to more efficiently operate our business, including in-sourcing. We continue to look for opportunities to in-source production that is currently provided by third parties. These activities may not produce the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits that we expect or efficiencies and benefits might be delayed. Implementation costs also might exceed expectations. Increases in costs of doing business may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nA pandemic or similar public health crises, such as COVID-19, could have a material adverse impact on ability to staff our operations. \n\nAs supplier to Healthcare and Life Sciences Customers, we fell within a &#8220;critical infrastructure&#8221; sector, and were also considered an essential business and therefore were exempt under various stay at home/shelter in place orders associated with COVID-19. These exemptions, however, may not persist in another pandemic or similar health crisis and there can be no assurance that in such a crisis, we will be able to operate in the same. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees continued to work because of the importance of our operations to the health and well-being of citizens in the countries in which we operate, and we implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of employees. While based on our response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that we have developed appropriate measures to ensure the health and well-being of our employees for similar or future health crises, there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may not otherwise be exposed to an illness outside of our workplace. If a number of our essential employees become ill, incapacitated or are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue working during the current or any future health crises, our operations may be adversely impacted. \n\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel or other compliance matters adversely impact our personnel. \n\nOur continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to hire and retain highly qualified people and if we are unable to do so, our business and operations may be impaired or disrupted. Labor market conditions, particularly in the United States, are challenging. The undersupply of highly qualified people has led to increased competition, which has led to higher costs and other labor-related difficulties. There is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining replacements to fill vacant positions, successors to fill retirements or employees moving to new positions, or other highly qualified personnel. In addition, legal, regulatory or compliance matters create significant distraction or diversion of significant or unanticipated resources or attention that could have a material adverse effect on the responsibilities and retention of qualified employees. \n\nWe could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers. \n\nWe rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business, including but not limited to interact with Customers and suppliers, fulfilling orders, generating invoices, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing Customer support, and fulfilling contractual obligations. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, cloud and software-as-a-service solutions, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our busines s. While we have been the previous target of cyberattacks and security breaches, none of these attacks or breaches to date have had a material adverse effect on the Company. We cannot guarantee that future cyberattacks, if successful, will not have a material effect on our business or financial results. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats continue to pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Some of our products, services, and information technology systems contain or use open-source software, which poses additional risks, including potential security vulnerabilities, licensing compliance issues, and quality issues. A security breach, whether of our products, of our Customers&#8217; network security and systems or of third-party hosting services, could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein. While we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of exp erts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. When cybersecurity incidents occur, we expect to follow our incident response protocols and address them in accordance with applicable governmental regulations and other legal requirements. Our response to these incidents and our investments to protect our information technology infrastructure and data may not shield us from significant losses and potential liability or prevent any future interruption or breach of our systems. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the risk of such vulnerability and attacks, including unauthorized access or attacks exploiting the fact that a large number of employees are working remotely. Furthermore, there has also been an increase in cyber incidents that appears to be associated with the Ukraine-Russia military conflict. Enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) was effective as of May 2018. The GDPR is focused on the protection of personal data not merely the privacy of personal data. The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual revenues for the preceding financial year or &#8364;20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements). \n\nNet sales and profitability of our Dental segment are highly dependent on our relationships with a limited number of large distributors. \n\nThe distribution network in the U.S. dental industry is concentrated, with relatively few distributors of consumable products accounting for a significant share of the sales volume to dentists. Historically, the top three Customers of Cantel's Dental segment accounted for more than 40.0% of its revenues. The loss of a significant amount of business from any of these Customers would have a material adverse effect on our Dental segment. In addition, because our Dental segment products are primarily sold through third-party distributors and not directly to end users, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors devote to our products. There can be no assurance that there will not be a loss or reduction in business from one or more of our major Customers. In addition, we cannot assure that revenues from Customers that have accounted for significant revenues in the past, either individually or as a group, will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT \n\nWe engage in acquisitions and affiliations, divestitures, and other business arrangements. Our growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully identify, price, and integrate strategic business candidates or otherwise optimize our business portfolio. \n\nOur success depends, in part, on strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, which are intended to complement or expand our businesses, divestiture of non-strategic businesses and other assets, and other actions intended to optimize our portfolio of businesses. This strategy depends upon our ability to identify, appropriately price, and complete these types of business development transactions or arrangements and to obtain any necessary financing. In the last several fiscal years we have made a number of acquisitions and dispositions. There can be no assurance that any acquisition or disposition will ultimately prove to \n\nbe a strategic success. Also, we may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions and divestitures at acceptable prices and terms. We continually evaluate potential business developments opportunities in the ordinary course of business. \n\nOur success with respect to these recent and future acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the businesses acquired, retain key personnel, realize identified cost synergies, manage the expanded business footprint and otherwise execute our strategies. Our success will also depend on our ability to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in joint ventures or other affiliations, or to divest or realign businesses. Competition for strategic business candidates may result in increases in costs and price for acquisition candidates and market valuation issues may reduce the value available for divestiture of non-strategic businesses. These types of transactions are also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including: delays in realizing or failure to realize anticipated benefits of the transactions; diversion of management&#8217;s time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties in retaining key employees, Customers, or suppliers of the acquired or divested businesses; difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, or other integration or divestiture difficulties; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or Customers; other events contributing to difficulties in generating future cash flows; risks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets or retention of liabilities for divested businesses and difficulties in obtaining financing. \n\nOur acquisition activity and ability to grow organically may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to access the financial markets . \n\nOur recent acquisitions have been financed largely through cash on hand, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and through public note offerings. Future acquisitions or other capital requirements and investments will necessitate additional cash. To the extent our existing sources of cash are insufficient to fund these or other future activities, we have and may need to raise additional funds through new or expanded borrowing arrangements or equity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds beyond those available under existing bank credit facilities on terms favorable to us, or at all, or that such facilities can be replaced when they terminate. \n\nThe integration of acquired businesses into STERIS may not be as successful as anticipated. \n\nIn recent years we have made several large acquisitions of business, including the acquisitions of Cantel Medical and Key Surgical. The integration of acquired businesses into STERIS involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks; potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and uncertainties related to design, operation and integration of internal controls over financial reporting. Difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into STERIS may result in the business performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, in strategic changes or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. STERIS&#8217;s existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by the integration actions. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among other factors: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; the inability to successfully integrate the business of an acquired business into STERIS in a manner that permits STERIS to achieve the full revenue and cost savings anticipated from the acquisition; \n\n&#8226; complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, integrated business; \n\n&#8226; not realizing anticipated operating synergies or incurring unexpected costs to realize such synergies; \n\n&#8226; integrating personnel from acquired businesses into STERIS while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services; \n\n&#8226; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition; \n\n&#8226; loss of key employees; \n\n&#8226; integrating relationships with Customers, vendors and business partners; \n\n&#8226; performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management&#8217;s attention caused by integration activities; and \n\n&#8226; the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, an acquired business and STERIS&#8217; ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nPast and future business acquisitions may not be as accretive to STERIS&#8217;s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share, which may negatively affect the market price of STERIS Shares. \n\nPast and future acquisitions may not be as accretive to STERIS&#8217;s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share as expected. Future events and conditions could decrease or delay any expected accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including adverse changes in market conditions, production levels, operating results, competitive conditions, laws and regulations affecting STERIS, capital expenditure obligations, higher than expected integration costs, lower than expected synergies and general economic conditions. \n\nAny decrease or delay of any accretion to, STERIS&#8217;s earnings per share or cash flow from operations per share could cause the price of the STERIS's ordinary shares to decline. \n\nWe incurred a substantial amount of additional debt to complete the Cantel Medical acquisition. Our debt level may limit our financial and business flexibility. \n\nWe funded the cash portion of the Cantel Medical acquisition consideration, as well as the refinancing, prepayment, replacement, redemption, repurchase, settlement upon conversion, discharge or defeasance of certain existing indebtedness of Cantel and its subsidiaries, transaction expenses, general corporate expenses and working capital needs, through the incurrence of approximately $2.1 billion of new indebtedness, which includes $1.350 billion of senior notes issued April 1, 2021 and a new delayed draw term loan agreement in the amount of $750 million. We also refinanced or settled approximately $1.0 billion of Cantel's long-term indebtedness, including convertible debt, outstanding. \n\nAs of March 31, 2023, STERIS had approximately $3.1 billion of indebtedness outstanding. STERIS&#8217;s ability to repay all the forgoing obligations will depend on, among other things, STERIS&#8217;s financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. \n\nOur increased indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders, including increasing STERIS&#8217;s interest obligations, general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements, requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate matters, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and our industry and creating a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness. \n\nSTERIS has incurred and expects to incur significant transaction and related costs in connection with business acquisitions and dispositions, which may be in excess of those anticipated. \n\nSTERIS has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of past business acquisitions and dispositions, including Cantel Medical and Key Surgical, and expects to incur similar costs for any future business acquisitions or dispositions. \n\nSTERIS expects to incur non-recurring costs associated with the integrations of recent acquisitions into STERIS and working towards achieving the desired synergies of such acquisitions. These fees and costs have been, and may continue to be, substantial. The non-recurring expenses include, among others, employee retention costs, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, and severance and benefit costs. \n\nSTERIS also expects to incur and has incurred costs to consolidate facilities and systems. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of any acquired business. Although STERIS expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of acquired businesses, should allow STERIS to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. The costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results. \n\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of an acquired business, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. \n\nThe success of an acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of an acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Assumptions that we have made with respect to acquisitions, such as with respect to anticipated operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies, significant long-term cash flow generation, and the continuation of our investment grade credit profile, may not be realized. The post-acquisition integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, changes in strategy or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies. There could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with acquisitions that were not discovered while performing due diligence. Although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses, product or \n\nservice lines, assets or technologies we purchase, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding their actual operating and financial condition, as well as their strategic fit. We may not be able to ascertain actual value or understand potential liabilities until or after we actually assume operation control of these businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies. \n\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material non-cash changes to our results of operation in the future. \n\nOur total assets include goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of March 31, 2023, we had recorded goodwill of $4 billion and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $3 billion. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a business acquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist. If the impairment evaluations for goodwill indicate the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly consolidated financial statements, we identified and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $490.6 million related to goodwill that arose with respect to Dental segment acquired in the Cantel acquisition. \n\n"

Our ordinary shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;STE.&#8221; \n\nHolders. As of March 31, 2023, there were approxim ately 403 h olders of record of our ordinary shares. \n\nDividend Policy. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors decides the timing and amount of any dividends we may pay. The Board expects to be able to continue to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. \n\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers. &#160; \n\nOn May 7, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of approximately $79.0 million (net of taxes, fees and commissions). On July 30, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the May 7, 2019 authorization of an additional amount of $300.0 million (net of taxes, fees and commissions). This share repurchases program was suspended on April 9, 2020 and the suspension was lifted effective February 10, 2022, enabling the Company to resume stock repurchases pursuant to prior authorizations. As of March 31, 2023, there was approximately $13.9 million (net of taxes, fees and commissions) of remaining availability under the Board authorized share repurchase program. The foregoing authorization was terminated May 3, 2023 and replaced with a new $500.0 million (net of taxes, fees and commissions) share repurchase program, which has no specified expiration date. We have not made any repurchases under the new share repurchase program to date. \n\nUnder the authorization, the Company may repurchase its shares from time to time through open market purchases, including 10b5-1 plans.

      "text": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nIn Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for STERIS and its subsidiaries including: \n\n&#8226; what factors affect our business; \n\n&#8226; what our earnings and costs were; \n\n&#8226; why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; \n\n&#8226; where our earnings came from; \n\n&#8226; how this affects our overall financial condition; \n\n&#8226; what our expenditures for capital projects were; and \n\n&#8226; where cash is expected to come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs. \n\nThe MD&#38;A also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As you read the MD&#38;A, it may be helpful to refer to information in Item 1, \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. This information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in STERIS. \n\nFINANCIAL MEASURES \n\nIn the following sections of the MD&#38;A, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. We sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. We define these financial measures as follows: \n\n&#8226; Backlog &#8211; We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. We use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements. \n\n&#8226; Debt-to-total capital &#8211; We define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders&#8217; equity. We use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth. \n\n&#8226; Days sales outstanding (&#8220;DSO&#8221;) &#8211; We define DSO as the average collection period for accounts receivable. It is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters&#8217; revenues, multiplied by 365 days. We use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect. \n\nWe, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; under SEC rules. We have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. These financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. Additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure, is available in the subsection of MD&#38;A titled, \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" \n\nREVENUES&#8211; DEFINED \n\nAs required by Regulation S-X, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income for each period presented. When we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the Regulation S-X requirements. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenues: \n\n&#8226; Revenues &#8211; Our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances. \n\n&#8226; Product Revenues &#8211; We define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products. \n\n&#8226; Service Revenues &#8211; We define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. Service revenues also include outsourced reprocessing services and instrument and scope repairs, as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our Applied Sterilization Technologies segment. \n\n&#8226; Capital Equipment Revenues &#8211; We define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes: steam and gas sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, pure steam/water systems, surgical lights and tables, and integrated OR. \n\n&#8226; Consumable Revenues &#8211; We define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes dedicated consumables including V-PRO, SYSTEM 1 and 1E consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, barrier protection solutions, cleaning consumables, dental and surgical instruments. \n\n&#8226; Recurring Revenues &#8211; We define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues. \n\nGENERAL OVERVIEW AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nSTERIS is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention. WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare, life sciences and dental products and services. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, endoscopy accessories, barrier products, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, dental instruments and tools, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing services, outsourced reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, automated endoscope reprocessors, and connectivity solutions such as operating room (&#8220;OR&#8221;) integrati on. \n\nWe operate and report our financial information in four reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies, Life Sciences and Dental. Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. We describe our business segments in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Business Segment Information.\" \n\nThe bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. \n\nAcquisitions . During fiscal 2023, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions which expanded our product and service offerings in the Applied Sterilization Technologies and Healthcare segments. Total aggregate consideration was approximately $49.8 million, including potential contingent consideration of $7.3 million. \n\nOn June 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding equity interests in Cantel Medical LLC (\"Cantel\") through a U.S. subsidiary. Cantel, formerly headquartered in Little Falls, New Jersey, with approximately 3,700 employees, is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental Customers. The total consideration for Cantel Common Stock and stock equivalents was $3.6 billion . \n\nWe believe that the acquisition will strengthen STERIS&#8217;s leadership in infection prevention by bringing together two complementary businesse s able to offer a broader set of Customers a more diversified selection of infection prevention, endoscopy and sterilization products and services. Cantel&#8217;s Dental business extended our business into a new Customer segment where there is an increasing focus on infection prevention protocols and processes. This business is reported as the Dental segment. The rest of Cantel was integrated into our existing Healthcare and Life Sciences segments. Additionally, the acquisition is expected to result in cost savings from optimizing global back-office infrastructure, leveraging best-demonstrated practices across locations and eliminating redundant public company costs. \n\nThe results of Cantel are only reflected in the results of operations and cash flows from June 2, 2021 forward, which will affect results of comparability to the prior period operations and cash flows. \n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Cantel, we completed three other tuck-in acquisitions during fiscal 2022, which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the Healthcare segment. Total aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately $3.1 million, net of cash acquired and including deferred consideration of $0.1 million. \n\nDivestitures. In April 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell certain assets of our Animal Health business to Veterinary Orthopedic Implants, LLC. We recorded net proceeds of $5.2 million and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $4.9 million in the Selling, general, and administrative expenses line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The business generated annual revenues of approximately $12.0 million. \n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell our Renal Care business to Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. for cash consideration of approximately $196.0 million, subject to certain potential adjustments, including a customary working capital adjustment and contingent consideration of $12.3 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $4.9 million. The transaction closed on January 3, 2022. We acquired the Renal Care business as part of the Cantel transaction, which closed on June 2, 2021, and had been integrated into STERIS's Healthcare segment. The Renal Care business generated annual revenues of approximately $180.0 million. The proceeds from the sale received at closing were used to repay outstanding debt. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we received an additional $1.4 million in working capital settlements related to the sale of this business. \n\nFor more information regarding our recent acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \" Business Acquisitions and Divestitures .\" \n\nHighlights. Revenues increased $372.8 million, or 8.1%, to $4,957.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $4,585.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2022. These increases reflect growth in the Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies, Life Sciences, and Dental segments, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies and divestiture activities. \n\nOur gross profit percentage decreased to 43.6% for fiscal 2023 as compared to 44.0% for fiscal 2022. Unfavorable impacts from inflation and productivity were partially offset by favorable impacts from pricing, mix, divestiture activity and fluctuations in currency. \n\nFiscal 2023 operating income decreased 37.0% to $268.2 million, as compared to fiscal 2022 operating income of $425.6 million. This decline was primarily due to a one time goodwill impairment charge of $490.6 million offset by a decrease in acquisition and integration expenses, which were primarily related to our acquisition of Cantel, as well as an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets. \n\nCash flows from operations were $756.9 million and free cash flow was $409.6 million in fiscal 2023 compared to cash flows from operations of $684.8 million and free cash flow of $399.0 million in fiscal 2022 (see subsection of MD&#38;A titled, \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information and related reconciliation of cash flows from operations to free cash flow) . The fiscal 2023 increase in cash flows from operations was primarily from lower costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel, partially offset by higher working capital, particularly inventory and accounts receivable. The increase in free cash flow was limited by increased capital spending. \n\nOur debt-to-total capital ratio was 33.6% at March 31, 2023. During the year, we increased our quarterly dividend for the seventeenth consecutive year to $0.47 per share per quarter. \n\nOutlook. In fiscal 2024 and beyond, we expect to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services. We anticipate continued supply chain and inflation pressures in fiscal 2024. Please refer to \"Information With Respect to Our Business In General\" in Item 1.\"Business\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \n\nWe, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; under SEC rules. We, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. \n\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. It is important for the reader to note that the non-GAAP financial measures used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles (capital expenditures) plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares. \n\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022: ##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 756,947 &#160; $ 684,811 Purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, net (361,969) (287,563) Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment and intangibles 14,587 &#160; 1,741 Free cash flow $ 409,565 &#160; $ 398,989 ##TABLE_END\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nIn the following subsections, we discuss our performance and the factors affecting it. We begin with a general overview of our operating results and then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments. \n\nThe discussion of and factors affecting our performance for the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. \n\nFISCAL 2023 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022 \n\nRevenues. The following table compares our revenues, in total and by type and geography, for the year ended March 31, 2023 to the year ended March 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended March 31, &#160; Percent \n\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Change Total revenues $ 4,957,839 &#160; $ 4,585,064 $ 372,775 8.1 % Revenues by type: Service revenues 2,172,512 &#160; 2,028,783 143,729 7.1 % Consumable revenues 1,714,857 &#160; 1,607,101 107,756 6.7 % Capital equipment revenues 1,070,470 &#160; 949,180 121,290 12.8 % Revenues by geography: Ireland revenues 74,463 &#160; 82,011 (7,548) (9.2) % United States revenues 3,586,486 &#160; 3,228,864 357,622 11.1 % Other foreign revenues 1,296,890 &#160; 1,274,189 22,701 1.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues increased $372.8 million, or 8.1%, to $4,957.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $4,585.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2022. These increases reflect added volume in the Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies, and Life Sciences segments and the benefits of a full year of Cantel activity and price increases in all segments. These positives were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies and divestiture activities. \n\nService revenues for fiscal 2023 increased $143.7 million, or 7.1% over fiscal 2022, reflecting growth in the Healthcare, Life Sciences and Applied Sterilization Technologies business segments. Consumable revenues for fiscal 2023 increased $107.8 million, or 6.7%, over fiscal 2022, reflecting growth in the Healthcare and Life Sciences segments and the benefit of a full year of Cantel activity. Capital equipment revenues for fiscal 2023 increased by $121.3 million, or 12.8%, over fiscal 2022, driven by organic growth in the Healthcare and Life Sciences segments. \n\nIreland revenues for fiscal 2023 were $74.5 million, representing a decline of $7.5 million, or 9.2%, as compared to fiscal 2022 revenues of $82.0 million, reflecting declines in service and consumable revenues. \n\nUnited States revenues for fiscal 2023 were $3,586.5 million, representing an increase of $357.6 million, or 11.1%, over fiscal 2022 revenues of $3,228.9 million, reflecting growth in service and capital equipment revenues. \n\nRevenues from other foreign locations for fiscal 2023 were $1,296.9 million, representing an increase of $22.7 million, or 1.8% over the fiscal 2022 revenues of $1,274.2 million. The increase reflects growth within the EMEA, Canada, and Latin American regions, which was partially offset by declines in the Asia Pacific region. \n\nGross Profit. The following table compares our gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2023 to the year ended March 31, 2022: &#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended March 31, Change Percent Change (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Gross profit: Product $ 1,271,357 &#160; $ 1,136,356 $ 135,001 11.9 % Service 888,335 &#160; 880,006 8,329 0.9 % Total gross profit $ 2,159,692 &#160; $ 2,016,362 $ 143,330 7.1 % Gross profit percentage: Product 45.6 &#160; % 44.5 % Service 40.9 &#160; % 43.4 % Total gross profit percentage 43.6 &#160; % 44.0 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOur gross profit is affected by the volume, pricing and mix of sales of our products and services, as well as the costs associated with the products and services that are sold. Our gross profit percentage decreased to 43.6% for fiscal 2023 as compared to 44.0% for fiscal 2022 . Unfavorable impacts from inflation (330 basis points) and productivity (50 basis points) were partially offset by favorable impacts from pricing (150 basis points), mix and other adjustments (130 basis points), divestiture activity (40 basis points), and fluctuations in currency (20 basis points). \n\nOperating Expenses. The following table compares our operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2023 to the year ended March 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START Years Ended March 31, Change Percent Change (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Operating expenses: Selling, general, and administrative $ 1,298,876 &#160; $ 1,502,752 $ (203,876) (13.6) % Goodwill impairment loss 490,565 &#160; &#8212; 490,565 NM Research and development 101,581 &#160; 87,944 13,637 15.5 % Restructuring expenses 485 &#160; 48 437 910.4 % Total operating expenses $ 1,891,507 &#160; $ 1,590,744 $ 300,763 18.9 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNM - Not meaningful \n\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Significant components of total Selling, general, and administrative expenses (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. SG&#38;A decreased 13.6% in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The fiscal 2023 reduction reflects lower spending for acquisition and integration expenses, which were primarily related to our acquisition of Cantel, and a decline in incentive compensation plan expense. \n\nGoodwill Impairment Loss. A goodwill impairment loss of $490.6 million was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as the result of an assessment of the fair value of the Dental segment made in connection with the preparation of our quarterly consolidated financial statements. For more information regarding our goodwill impairment loss, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\" \n\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses increased $13.6 million in fiscal 2023 over fiscal 2022, primarily due to the addition of Cantel and other recent acquisitions. Research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations.

Interest on Base Rate Advances is payable quarterly in arrears and interest on Term Benchmark Advances is payable in arrears at the end of the relevant interest period therefor, but in no event less frequently than every three months. \n\n&#8226; On May 3, 2023, in connection with the upcoming replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with SOFR, the Borrower, Guarantors, Lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., each as defined in each of the agreements, amended the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement, and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. The amendments concern pricing, technical, administrative, and operational changes related to borrowings in U.S. dollars. The above descriptions reflect those amendments. \n\n&#8226; On April 1, 2021, STERIS Irish FinCo Unlimited Company (\"FinCo,\" \"STERIS Irish FinCo,\" the \"Issuer\") completed an offering of $1,350.0 million in aggregate principal amount, of its senior notes in two separate tranches: (i) $675.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuer&#8217;s 2.70% Senior Notes due 2031 (the &#8220;2031 Notes&#8221;) and (ii) $675.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuer&#8217;s 3.750% Senior Notes due 2051 (the &#8220;2051 Notes&#8221; and, together with the 2031 Notes, the &#8220;Senior Public Notes&#8221;). The Senior Public Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of April 1, 2021 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), among FinCo, STERIS plc, STERIS Corporation and STERIS Limited (the &#8220;Guarantors&#8221;) and U.S. Bank National Association as trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 1, 2021, among FinCo, the Guarantors and the Trustee (the &#8220;Supplemental Indenture&#8221; and, together with the Base Indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;). Each of the Guarantors guaranteed the Senior Public Notes jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis (the &#8220;Guarantees&#8221;). The 2031 Notes will mature on March 15, 2031 and the 2051 Notes will mature on March 15, 2051. The Senior Public Notes will bear interest at the rates set forth above. Interest on the Senior Public Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2021, until their respective maturities. \n\n&#8226; As of March 31, 2023, a total of $301.7 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, based on currency exchange rates as of March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2023, we had $938.4 million of unused funding available under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a sub-limit that reduces the maximum amount available to us by letters of credit outstanding. At March 31, 2023, there was $9.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2023, $72.5 million and $625.6 million were outstanding under the Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan, respectively. \n\nOur outstanding Private Placement Senior Notes at March 31, 2023 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in thousands) Applicable Note Purchase Agreement Maturity Date U.S. Dollar Value at March 31, 2023 $80,000 Senior notes at 3.35% 2012 Private Placement December 2024 80,000 &#160; $25,000 Senior notes at 3.55% 2012 Private Placement December 2027 25,000 &#160; $125,000 Senior notes at 3.45% 2015 Private Placement May 2025 125,000 &#160; $125,000 Senior notes at 3.55% 2015 Private Placement May 2027 125,000 &#160; $100,000 Senior notes at 3.70% 2015 Private Placement May 2030 100,000 &#160; $50,000 Senior notes at 3.93% 2017 Private Placement February 2027 50,000 &#160; &#8364;60,000 Senior notes at 1.86% 2017 Private Placement February 2027 65,254 &#160; $45,000 Senior notes at 4.03% 2017 Private Placement February 2029 45,000 &#160; &#8364;20,000 Senior notes at 2.04% 2017 Private Placement February 2029 21,752 &#160; &#163;45,000 Senior notes at 3.04% 2017 Private Placement February 2029 55,579 &#160; &#8364;19,000 Senior notes at 2.30% 2017 Private Placement February 2032 20,664 &#160; &#163;30,000 Senior notes at 3.17% 2017 Private Placement February 2032 37,053 &#160; Total Senior Notes $ 750,302 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Private Placement Senior Notes were issued as follows: \n\n&#8226; On February 27, 2017, Limited issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $95.0 million, &#8364;99.0 million, and &#163;75.0 million of senior notes in a private placement to certain institutional investors in an offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. These notes have maturities of between 10 years and 15 years from the issue date. The agreement governing these notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants. \n\n&#8226; On May 15, 2015, STERIS Corporation issued and sold $350.0 million of senior notes in a private placement to certain institutional investors in an offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. These notes have maturities of 10 years to 15 years from the issue date. The agreement governing these notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants. \n\n&#8226; In December 2012 and in February 2013, STERIS Corporation issued and sold $200.0 million of senior notes in a private placement to certain institutional investors in offerings that were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The agreement governing the notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants. \n\n&#8226; The private placement note purchase agreements specify increases to the coupon interest rates while the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the note purchase agreements, exceeds certain thresholds. Beginning September 1, 2021, and through March 31, 2023, the coupon rates on the 2012 private placement notes were increased by 0.50%. \n\n&#8226; On March 19, 2021, STERIS Corporation as issuer, and the Company, Limited and FinCo, as guarantors, entered into (1) a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement dated March 5, 2019 (which had amended and restated certain note purchase agreements originally dated December 4, 2012) per the 2012 and 2013 senior notes (the &#8220;2012 Amendment&#8221;), and (2) a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement dated March 5, 2019 (which had amended and restated certain note purchase agreements originally dated March 31, 2015) for the 2015 senior notes (the &#8220;2015 Amendment&#8221;). Also on March 19, 2021, Limited, as Issuer, and the Company, STERIS Corporation and FinCo, as guarantors, entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement dated March 5, 2019 (which had amended and restated a certain note purchase agreement originally dated January 23, 2017) for the 2017 senior notes (together with the 2012 Amendment and the 2015 Amendment, the &#8220;NPA Amendments&#8221;). The NPA Amendments provided, among other things, for the waiver of certain repurchase rights of the note holders and increased the size of certain baskets to more closely align with other current credit agreement baskets. \n\nAt March 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our indebtedness. For additional information on our sources of funding and credit, refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, &#8220;Debt.&#8221; \n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES \n\nOur capital expenditure program is a component of our long-term strategy. This program includes, among other things, investments in new and existing facilities, business expansion projects, radioisotope (cobalt-60), and information technology enhancements and research and development advances. During fiscal 2023, our capital expenditures amounted to $362.0 million. We use cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalent balances to fund capital expenditures. In fiscal 2024, we plan to continue to invest in facility expansions, particularly within the Healthcare and Applied Sterilization Technologies segments and in ongoing maintenance for existing facilities. \n\nMATERIAL FUTURE CASH OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS \n\nCash Requirements. We intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and meet our other liquidity needs. Our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors, including our rate of sales growth, our Customers&#8217; acceptance of our products and services, the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities, the timing and extent of our research and development projects, changes in our operating expenses and other factors. To the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities. There can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all. \n\nOur material future cash obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31, 2023 are presented in the following tables. Commercial commitments include standby letters of credit, letters of credit required as security under our self-insured risk retention policies, and other potential cash outflows resulting from events that require us to fulfill commitments. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Payments due by March 31, &#160; (dollars in thousands) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 and thereafter Total Material Future Cash Obligations: Debt $ 60,000 $ 165,938 $ 479,173 $ 614,942 $ 1,780,047 $ 3,100,100 Operating leases 41,709 33,584 26,129 19,659 120,359 241,440 Purchase obligations 214,272 39,418 569 569 1,328 256,156 Benefit payments under defined benefit plans 6,279 6,265 6,458 6,663 44,160 69,825 Trust assets available for benefit payments under defined benefit plans (6,279) (6,265) (6,458) (6,663) (44,160) (69,825) Benefit payments under other post-retirement benefits plans 1,121 1,019 913 823 3,351 7,227 Expected contributions to defined benefit plans 3,955 1,992 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 5,947 Total Material Future Cash Obligations $ 321,057 $ 241,951 $ 506,784 $ 635,993 $ 1,905,085 $ 3,610,870 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe table above includes only the principal amounts of our material future cash obligations.

The Senior Public Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis. The Senior Public Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of STERIS Irish FinCo and the Guarantors, respectively, and are equal in priority with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, from time to time outstanding, including, as applicable, under the Private Placement Senior Notes, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan. \n\nAll of the liabilities of non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of STERIS, other than STERIS Irish FinCo, STERIS Limited and STERIS Corporation, including any claims of trade creditors, are effectively senior to the Senior Public Notes. \n\nSTERIS Irish FinCo&#8217;s main objective and source of revenues and cash flows is the provision of short- and long-term financing for the activities of STERIS plc and its subsidiaries. \n\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, interest and other fees to the Issuer and ability of the Issuer and Guarantors to service the Senior Public Notes may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as agreements to which our subsidiaries are or may become a party. \n\nThe following is a summary of these guarantees: \n\nGuarantees of Senior Notes \n\n&#8226; Parent Company Guarantor &#8211; STERIS plc \n\n&#8226; Subsidiary Issuer &#8211; STERIS Irish FinCo Unlimited Company \n\n&#8226; Subsidiary Guarantor &#8211; STERIS Limited \n\n&#8226; Subsidiary Guarantor &#8211; STERIS Corporation \n\nThe guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged: \n\n&#8226; in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the indenture; \n\n&#8226; in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the indenture; \n\n&#8226; in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, at such time as such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a borrower under or no longer guarantees any material credit facility (subject to restatement in specified circumstances); \n\n&#8226; upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the notes or the discharge of the Issuer&#8217;s obligations under the indenture in accordance with the terms of the indenture; \n\n&#8226; as described in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or \n\n&#8226; in the case of the Parent, if the Issuer ceases for any reason to be a subsidiary of the Parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of the Parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any Material Credit Facility of the Issuer terminate upon the Issuer ceasing to be a subsidiary of the Parent; and \n\n&#8226; upon such Guarantor delivering to the trustee an officer&#8217;s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction or release have been complied with. \n\nThe obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee are expressly limited to the maximum amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance. Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution from each \n\nGuarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor&#8217;s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. \n\nThe following tables present summarized results of operations for the year ended March 31, 2023 and summarized balance sheet information at March 31, 2023 and 2022 for the obligor group of the Senior Public Notes. The obligor group consists of the Parent Company Guarantor, Subsidiary Issuer, and Subsidiary Guarantors for the Senior Public Notes. The summarized financial information is presented after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuer and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor or issuer. Transactions with non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented separately. \n\n##TABLE_START Summarized Results of Operations (in thousands) Twelve Months Ended March 31, &#160; 2023 &#160; Revenues $ 2,377,412 &#160; Gross profit \n\n1,349,465 &#160; Operating costs arising from transactions with non-issuers and non-guarantors - net 627,084 &#160; Income from operations 782,219 &#160; Non-operating income (expense) arising from transactions with subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors - net 728,793 &#160; Net income $ 719,486 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Summarized Balance Sheet Information ( in thousands) March 31, March 31, &#160; 2023 2022 Receivables due from non-issuers and non-guarantor subsidiaries $ 17,797,185 &#160; $ 16,033,719 Other current assets 614,233 &#160; 400,776 Total current assets $ 18,411,418 &#160; $ 16,434,495 Non-current receivables due from non-issuers and non-guarantor subsidiaries $ 1,827,125 &#160; $ 2,001,742 Goodwill 96,892 &#160; 95,688 Other non-current assets 206,331 &#160; 142,711 Total non-current assets $ 2,130,348 &#160; $ 2,240,141 Payables due to non-issuers and non-guarantor subsidiaries $ 19,347,473 &#160; $ 17,053,749 Other current liabilities 255,746 &#160; 231,043 Total current liabilities $ 19,603,219 &#160; $ 17,284,792 Non-current payables due to non-issuers and non-guarantor subsidiaries $ 684,985 &#160; $ 1,102,873 Other non-current liabilities 3,128,853 &#160; 3,134,777 Total non-current liabilities $ 3,813,838 &#160; $ 4,237,650 ##TABLE_END\n\nIntercompany balances and transactions between the obligor group have been eliminated, and amounts due from, amounts due to, and transactions with non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented separately.

If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nThe following subsections describe our most critical accounting estimates, and assumptions. Our accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\" \n\nEstimates and Assumptions. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. These estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management&#8217;s control. As a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. We periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. \n\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the Customer. Revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services. Product revenue is recognized when control passes to the Customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms. Service revenue is recognized when the Customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the Customer. Our Customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. Our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale. Our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products. Shipping and handling costs charged to Customers are included in Product revenues. The associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of revenues. Revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from Customers. \n\nWe have individual Customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. Dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. We reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded. The reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. Estimated returns are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nIn transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the Customer. We allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately. \n\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of the Customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. We do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year. \n\nWe do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less. \n\nCertain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. At March 31, 2023, assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses. We maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by Customers. We estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, Customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. We also analyze significant Customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific Customer&#8217;s inability to pay. As a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. These analyses require judgment. If the financial condition of our Customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for credit losses. \n\nInventories and Reserves. Inventories are stated at the lower of their cost and net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") cost method. Inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead. \n\nWe review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. We record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. If future \n\nmarket conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to Cost of revenues. \n\nAsset Impairment Losses. Property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. We conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income during that period. \n\nWhen we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. If we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected. \n\nPurchase Accounting and Goodwill. Assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. We do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results. \n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. We may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances, we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Management's judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. \n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly consolidated financial statements, we identified that the estimated fair value of the Dental segment was below the carrying value and recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $490.6 million. For additional information regarding the goodwill impairment charge, refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\" \n\nWe evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists. \n\nIncome Taxes. Our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. We use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. We cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published. \n\nWe evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. We determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. We review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. \n\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nWe believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period. \n\nAdditional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, &#8220;Income Taxes.&#8221; \n\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities. We record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers&#8217; compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. We use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. This liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. We review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. We maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. The obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. Estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the \"Prepaid expenses and other current assets\" line, and the \"Other assets\" line of our consolidated balance sheets. Our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 was $30.4 million and $26.1 million , respectively. \n\nWe are also self-insured for employee medical claims. We estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. If actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods. \n\nContingencies. We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, gases, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief. \n\nWe record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. We have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. In our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. We record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. Refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for additional information. \n\nWe are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. The IRS of the United States routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns. \n\nAdditional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\" \n\nBenefit Plans. We provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees. In addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement benefits plan for two groups of United States retirees. Benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage. \n\nEmployee pension and post-retirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. Changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. Future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. We believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. A summary of significant assumptions used to determine the March 31, 2023 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2023 net periodic benefit costs is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Synergy Health plc Isotron BV Synergy Health Daniken AG Synergy Health Radeberg Synergy Health Allershausen Harwell Dosimeters Ltd U.S. Post- Retirement Benefits Plan Funding Status Funded Funded Unfunded Unfunded Unfunded Funded Unfunded Assumptions used to determine March 31, 2023 Benefit obligations: Discount rate 4.70 &#160; % 3.70 &#160; % 2.05 &#160; % 3.80 &#160; % 3.70 &#160; % 4.80 &#160; % 4.75 &#160; % Assumptions used to determine fiscal 2023 Net periodic benefit costs: Discount rate 2.80 &#160; % 1.80 &#160; % 2.05 &#160; % 2.00 &#160; % 2.20 &#160; % 4.80 &#160; % 3.25 &#160; % Expected return on plan assets 3.20 &#160; % 1.80 &#160; % 1.95 &#160; % n/a n/a n/a n/a ##TABLE_END\n\nNA &#8211; Not applicable. \n\nWe develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios, and the long-term asset class return expectations. Generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. Holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2023 benefit costs by less than $0.1 million. \n\nWe develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. Generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. Holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2023 net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $8.0 million at March 31, 2023. \n\nWe have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. The assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 7.5% to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. A 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at March 31, 2023: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 100 Basis Point (dollars in thousands) Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 1 &#160; (1) ##TABLE_END\n\nWe recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. This amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). Changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. We measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, &#8220;Benefit Plans,&#8221; contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans. \n\nShare-Based Compensation. We measure the estimated fair value for share-based compensation awards, including grants of employee stock options, at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. We selected the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our share-based stock option compensation awards. This model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect share-based compensation expense. \n\nShare-based compensation ex pense was $39.0 million in fiscal 2023, $57.7 million in fiscal 2022 and $26.0 million million in fiscal 2021. Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled, &#8220;Share-Based Compensation,&#8221; contains additional information about our share-based compensation plans. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis Form 10-K may contain statements concerning certain trends, expectations, forecasts, estimates, or other forward-looking information affecting or relating to STERIS or its industry, products or activities that are intended to qualify for the protections afforded &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other laws and regulations.

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various risks, including, but not limited to, interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity risks. These risks are described in the sections that follow. \n\nINTEREST RATE RISK \n\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had $2,100.3 million in fixed rate senior notes outstanding. As of March 31, 2023, we had $301.7 million in outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement and $698.1 million in term loans which are exposed to changes in interest rates. Based upon our debt structure at March 31, 2023, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in floating interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $10.0 million. We monitor our interest rate risk, but do not engage in any hedging activities using derivative financial instruments. For additional information regarding our debt structure, refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, &#8220;Debt.&#8221; \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK \n\nWe are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This foreign currency exchange risk arises when we conduct business in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. For most operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements titled, &#8220;Reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income,&#8221; contains additional information about the impact of translation on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and equity. Transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Since we operate internationally and approximately 30% of our revenues and 30% of our Cost of revenues are generated outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact our financial position, results of operations, and competitive position. \n\nWe enter into foreign currency forward co ntracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including intercompany transactions. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At March 31, 2023, we held foreign currency forward contracts to buy 19.5 million British pounds sterling; and to sell 150.0 million Mexican pesos, and 7.0 million Singapore dollars and 6.0 million euros. \n\nCOMMODITY RISK \n\nWe are dependent on basic raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies used in our operations. Our financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials. Some of these materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or only a single supplier. These materials are also key source materials for our competitors. Therefore, if demand for these materials rises, we may experience increased costs and/or limited or unavailable supplies. As a result, we may not be able to acquire key production materials on a timely basis, which could impact our ability to produce products and satisfy incoming sales orders on a timely basis. In addition, the costs of these materials can rise suddenly and result in significantly higher costs of production. We believe that we have adequate sources of supply for many of our key materials and energy sources. Where appropriate, we enter into long-term supply contracts as a basis to guarantee a reliable supply. We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in a certain commodity that impacts raw materials included in our Cost of revenues. At March 31, 2023, we held commodity swap contracts to buy 753.0 thousand pounds of nickel. \n\n"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nOur management, including the Principal Executive Officer (&#8220;PEO&#8221;) and Principal Financial Officer (&#8220;PFO&#8221;), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, the PEO and PFO have determined that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. \n\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS \n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the PEO and PFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023 based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under this framework, management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2023. Our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities that were acquired during fiscal 2023. Total assets of the acquired businesses represented approximately 0.50 % of our total assets as of March 31, 2023 (of which 0.30% represent goodwill and intangible assets which were subjected to corporate controls) and approximately 0.30 % of our total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation under this framework, management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2023. \n\nThe independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements has issued an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of \n\nSTERIS plc \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited STERIS plc and subsidiaries&#8217; internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, STERIS plc and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023 , based on the COSO criteria. \n\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management&#8217;s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities that were acquired during the year ended March 31, 2023 , which are included in the fiscal 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 0.50% of total assets as of March 31, 2023 and approximately 0.30% of total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the entities that were acquired during the year ended March 31, 2023 . \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2023 , and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated May 26, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nCleveland, Ohio \n\nMay 26, 2023 \n\n"
