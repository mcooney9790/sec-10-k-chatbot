In addition, we establish development and engagement plans for top talent that may include formal training, mentoring, coaching, sponsorship and experiential learning opportunities. \n\nHealth and Workplace Safety \n\nOur primary focus is on the health and safety of our employees. Our multi-functional working group established in fiscal 2020 to respond the COVID-19 pandemic has transitioned to a Pandemic Preparedness working group that continues to monitor and respond to COVID-19 and other issues that pose a health risk to our employees. This group closely follows the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as national and local authorities in the regions where we perform work for our customers. \n\nWe believe we are a leader in the field of occupational health and safety (&#8220;OH&#38;S&#8221;), and we place a strong emphasis on these activities, both internally and on behalf of our customers. Internally, we emphasize direct management responsibility, corporate policies and procedures, OH&#38;S program implementation, employee training and compliance assessments. Our corporate policies and procedures support compliance with OH&#38;S regulations at work locations. We have a proactive compliance program of employee education, training, auditing and reporting that, through employee awareness and integration into our business operations, supports our commitment to a safe and healthy work environment. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nOur operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, our operations may become subject to future laws and regulations, including those related to climate change and environmental sustainability. See \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Although we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with, or the liabilities associated with, environmental laws will materially and adversely affect us, we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nWe conduct research and development activities under customer-funded contracts and with company-funded research and development funds. Company-funded research and development includes independent research and development (\"IR&#38;D\") and commercial and international research and development. Company-funded research and development expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Our company-funded research and development expense was $116 million, $109 million and $73 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which as a percentage of consolidated revenues was 0.8% for both fiscal 2022 and 2021 and 0.6% for fiscal 2020. We charge expenses for research and development activities performed under customer contracts directly to cost of revenues for those contracts. \n\nIntellectual Property Rights \n\nOur technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, although we do selectively seek patent protection. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our products, software programs, methodologies and know-how. This proprietary information is protected in confidence as trade secrets, using non-disclosure and other definitive agreements. We selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties. \n\nIn connection with the performance of services and solutions, the U.S. government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts. Generally, the U.S. government may disclose or license such information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors. In the case of some subcontracts that we perform, the prime contractor generally obtains rights to use the programs and products that we deliver under the subcontract to perform its prime contract obligations. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 10 \n\nPART I \n\nCompetition \n\nCompetition for contracts is significant, and we often compete against a large number of well-established corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition. We also compete against smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas, the U.S. government&#8217;s own capabilities and federal non-profit contract research centers. As a result of the diverse requirements of the U.S. government and our commercial customers, we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations. \n\nWe believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies: Amentum Services Inc., Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., CACI International Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., KBR Inc., L3Harris, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, SAIC and Peraton. These companies span across sectors that include engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors, diversified U.S. and international IT providers and contractors focused solely on technical services, supply chain management, other logistics services and major systems operations and maintenance, homeland security and health solutions. \n\nWe compete on various factors, including our technical expertise and qualified professional and/or security-cleared personnel, our ability to deliver innovative cost-effective solutions in a timely manner, successful program execution, our reputation and standing with customers, pricing, the size and geographic presence of our company and past performance credentials. \n\nContract Procurement \n\nOur business is heavily regulated, and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. The U.S. government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives. Today, U.S. government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products. Budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or pre-qualify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through single-award contracts. The predominant contracting methods through which U.S. government agencies procure services and products include the following: \n\n&#8226; Definitive Award Contracts. U.S. government agencies may procure services and products through single definitive award contracts which specify the scope of services or products purchased and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services or products. When an agency has a requirement, the agency will issue a solicitation or request for proposal to which interested contractors can submit a proposal. The bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete. For the contractor, this method of contracting may provide greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of services or products from the single definitive successful awardee. \n\n&#8226; Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (\"IDIQ\") Contracts. The U.S. government uses IDIQ contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or products on pre-established terms and conditions. The U.S. government then issues task orders under the IDIQ contracts to purchase the specific services or products it needs. IDIQ contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process. Under a single-award IDIQ contract, all task orders under that contract are awarded to one pre-established contractor. Under a multiple-award IDIQ contract, task orders can be awarded to any of the pre-established contractors, which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders. Multiple-award IDIQ contracts that are open for any government agency to use for procurement are commonly referred to as \"government-wide acquisition contracts.\" IDIQ contracts often have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, therefore enabling, but not committing, the U.S. government to purchase substantial amounts of services or products from one or more contractors. At the time an IDIQ contract is awarded (prior to the award of any task orders), a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. government will purchase under the contract, and in the case of a multiple-award IDIQ, the contractor from which such purchases may be made. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 11 \n\nPART I \n\n&#8226; U.S. General Services Administration (\"GSA\") Schedule Contracts. The GSA maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and products with agreed-upon prices for use throughout the U.S. government. In order for a company to provide services under a GSA Schedule contract, a company must be pre-qualified and awarded a contract by the GSA. When an agency uses a GSA Schedule contract to meet its requirements, the agency, or the GSA on behalf of the agency, conducts the procurement. The user agency, or the GSA on its behalf, evaluates the user agency&#8217;s requirements and initiates a competition limited to GSA Schedule qualified contractors. GSA Schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement costs. Similar to IDIQ contracts, at the time a GSA Schedule contract is awarded, a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. government will purchase under the contract. \n\n&#8226; Other Transaction Authority (&#8220;OTA&#8221;) agreements. Under certain circumstances, U.S. government agencies can enter into OTA agreements instead of traditional contracts. These agreements are used for two primary purposes: (1) to carry out basic, applied or advanced research projects that typically relate to technology stimulation or research, and (2) to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the DoD, or to improve platforms, systems, components or materials in use by DoD components and agencies. OTA agreements are generally exempt from federal procurement regulations. These exemptions grant the U.S. government the flexibility to include, amend or exclude contract clauses and requirements that are mandatory in traditional procurements. OTA agreements also grant more flexibility to structure agreements in numerous ways, including joint ventures, partnerships or multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers. \n\nWe often partner with other companies, including our competitors, to submit bids for large U.S. government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract. Our relationships with our partners, including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor, vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program, contract or customer requirements, as well as the relative size, qualifications, capabilities, customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners. \n\nContracting with the U.S. government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks, including the U.S. government&#8217;s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. government. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the U.S. government issues a termination for convenience. These regulations and risks are described in more detail below under \"Business&#8211;Regulation\" and \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nContract Types \n\nGenerally, the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the U.S. government and may depend on certain factors, including the type and complexity of the work to be performed, degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance, the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals. We generate revenues under several types of contracts, including the following: \n\n&#8226; Cost-reimbursement contracts include cost-plus-fixed-fee, award-fee and incentive - fee contracts. These contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee. These contracts are typically used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk but require us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and budget. Award and incentive fees are generally based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and/or technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company's performance against contractual criteria. Incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 12 \n\nPART I \n\n&#8226; Fixed-price-incentive-fee (\"FP-IF\") contracts are substantially similar to cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts except they require specified targets for cost and profit, price ceiling (but not a profit ceiling or floor) and profit adjustment formula. Under an FP-IF contract, the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a cost-share arrangement, which affects profitability. Generally, if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated. \n\n&#8226; Time-and-materials (\"T&#38;M\") contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other direct costs. This type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty about the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. On T&#38;M contracts, we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over the period of performance of the contracts. \n\n&#8226; Fixed-price-level-of-effort (\"FP-LOE\") contracts are substantially similar to T&#38;M contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time on work that can be stated only in general terms. This type of contract is generally used when the contractor is required to perform an investigation or study in a specific research and development area and to provide a report showing the results achieved based on the level of effort. Payment is based on the effort expended rather than the results achieved. \n\n&#8226; Firm-Fixed-Price (&#8220;FFP&#8221;) contracts provide for a fixed price for specified products, systems and/or services. This type of contract is typically used when the customer acquires products and services on the basis of reasonably definitive specifications that have a determinable fair and reasonable price. These contracts offer us potential increased profits if we can complete the work at lower costs than planned, but FFP contracts increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. \n\nOur earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract and the nature of services or products provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive-fee and award-fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost-reimbursement and T&#38;M contracts generally have lower profitability than FFP contracts. \n\nSeasonality \n\nThe U.S. government's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. In addition, our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. We tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season. \n\nRegulation \n\nWe are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate. We provide services and products to numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including to the DoD, the U.S. Intelligence Community and the DHS. When working with these and other U.S. government agencies and entities, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. Some significant laws and regulations that affect us include: \n\n&#8226; the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\"FAR\") and supplements, including the DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (\"DFARS\"), which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts; \n\n&#8226; the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; \n\n&#8226; the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials; \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 13 \n\nPART I \n\n&#8226; the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval; \n\n&#8226; the False Statements Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability for making false statements to the U.S. government; and \n\n&#8226; the U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (\"CAS\"), which imposes accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts. \n\nThese regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements. Among other things, these laws and regulations: \n\n&#8226; require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; \n\n&#8226; define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-type U.S. government contracts; \n\n&#8226; require compliance with U.S. government CAS; \n\n&#8226; require reviews by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\") and other U.S. government agencies of compliance with government requirements for a contractor&#8217;s business systems; \n\n&#8226; restrict the use and dissemination of and require the protection of unclassified contract-related information and information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data; and \n\n&#8226; require us not to compete for work if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, as defined by these laws and regulations, related to such work exists and/or cannot be appropriately mitigated, neutralized or avoided. \n\nThe U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance trainings relevant to their position. \n\nPrivacy and Data Security Laws \n\nSome of our operations and service offerings involve access to and use by us of personally identifiable information and/or protected health information. These activities are regulated by extensive federal, state and international privacy and data security laws requiring organizations to provide certain privacy protections and security safeguards for such information. For example: \n\n&#8226; the European Union's (\"EU&#8217;s\") General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), which took effect in May 2018, has created new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of EU data subjects, which require investment into ongoing data protection activities and documentation requirements, and creates the potential for significantly increased fines for noncompliance; \n\n&#8226; the United Kingdom&#8217;s (&#8220;UK&#8217;s&#8221;) General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect on January 1, 2021, creates similar compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of UK data subjects as are imposed by the EU GDPR; \n\n&#8226; the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which took effect on January 1, 2020, provides new consumer privacy rights to natural persons residing in California by regulating the processing of personal information of California residents and increasing the obligations on businesses in connection with such activities; \n\n&#8226; the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which took effect in most material respects on January 1, 2023. The CPRA modifies the CCPA significantly, including by expanding consumers&#8217; rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, extending the scope of the CCPA to include employees and job applicants residing in California and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts; and \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 14 \n\nPART I \n\n&#8226; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, establishes privacy and security compliance obligations with respect to the processing of protected health information by covered entities and business associates, which require investment in technical and organizational compliance measures and creates the potential for substantial fines for noncompliance. \n\nCompany Website and Information \n\nOur corporate headquarters is located at 1750 Presidents Street, Reston, VA 20190 and our telephone number is (571) 526-6000.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nIn your evaluation of our company and business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with information disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II of this Annual Report, and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed and our stock price could decline. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as our ability to collect receivables, overall U.S. and global economic and industry conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest, exchange rates and inflation, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business, financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in our stock price. \n\nSummary of Risk Factors \n\nThis risk factor summary contains a high-level summary of risks associated with our business. It does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read this risk factor summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth following this summary. A summary of our risks includes, but is not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; We depend on government agencies as our primary customers and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; A decline in the U.S. government budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects. \n\n&#8226; Because we depend on U.S. government contracts, a delay in the completion of the U.S. government&#8217;s budget and appropriations process could delay procurement of the products, services and solutions we provide and adversely affect our future revenues. \n\n&#8226; Due to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests, we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability. \n\n&#8226; The U.S. government may terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability. \n\n&#8226; We face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects. \n\n&#8226; Our failure to comply with various complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties, including termination of our U.S. government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. government contracts and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting. \n\n&#8226; The U.S. government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time. \n\n&#8226; As a U.S. government contractor, our partners and we are subject to reviews, audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which could adversely affect our profitability, cash position or growth prospects if resolved unfavorably to us. \n\n&#8226; Our business is subject to governmental review and investigation, which could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and growth prospects. \n\n&#8226; Investigations, audits, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend, which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability, and could damage our reputation. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 16 \n\nPART I \n\n&#8226; Our business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements, and any violation of these requirements could harm our business. \n\n&#8226; Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security which could subject us to investigations, claims or monetary penalties against us, require us to change our business practices or otherwise adversely affect our revenues and profitability. \n\n&#8226; The extent to which our business will be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n\n&#8226; Misconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures and others working on our behalf could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation. \n\n&#8226; A failure to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled employees, including our management team, would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations. \n\n&#8226; We may not realize the full amounts reflected in our backlog as revenues, which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects. \n\n&#8226; Our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to estimate and manage costs, time and resources accurately. \n\n&#8226; We use estimates in recognizing revenues, and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; Cybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results, impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position. \n\n&#8226; Internal system or service failures, or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. \n\n&#8226; Our business is subject to disruption caused by physical or transition risks that could adversely affect our operations, profitability and overall financial position. \n\n&#8226; Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. \n\n&#8226; Our success depends, in part, on our ability to work with complex and rapidly changing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. \n\n&#8226; We have classified contracts with the U.S. government, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business. \n\n&#8226; We have made and continue to make acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\n&#8226; Goodwill and other intangible assets represent significant assets on our balance sheet and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations. \n\n&#8226; We depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors. If we are not able to maintain these relationships, or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer, our revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; Our services and operations sometimes involve using, handling or disposing of hazardous substances, which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 17 \n\nPART I \n\n&#8226; We could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats. \n\n&#8226; Our insurance, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses. \n\n&#8226; We face risks associated with our international business. \n\n&#8226; We have only a limited ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights, which are important to our success. Our failure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position. \n\n&#8226; Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results \n\n&#8226; We cannot assure you that we will continue to pay or increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase shares of our common stock. \n\n&#8226; Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 18 \n\nPART I \n\nIndustry and Economic Risks \n\nWe depend on government agencies as our primary customers and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected. \n\nOur total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government (including all branches of the U.S. military), either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government generated approximately 86% in fiscal 2022, and 87% in fiscal 2021 and 2020. We expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under U.S. government contracts. Our reputation and relationships with the U.S. government, particularly with the agencies of the DoD and the U.S. Intelligence Community, are key factors in maintaining and growing our revenues, and enable us to provide informal input and advice to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. In addition, negative publicity, including reports from the press or social media coverage, regardless of accuracy or completeness, and which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct, conflicts of interest, poor contract performance, deficiencies in services, reports, products or other deliverables, security breaches or other security incidents or other aspects of our business, could harm our reputation with these agencies and with certain non-U.S. customers. Due to the sensitive nature of our work and our confidentiality obligations to our customers, and despite our ongoing efforts to provide transparency, we may be unable to or limited in our ability to respond to such negative publicity, which could also harm our reputation and our business. If our reputation is negatively affected or if we are unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, certain customers could cease to do business with us and our ability to bid successfully for new business may be adversely affected, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, our ability to hire or retain employees and our standing in professional communities, to which we contribute and receive expert knowledge, could be diminished. If any of the foregoing occurs, the amount of business with the U.S. government and other customers could decrease, and our business, future revenues, financial condition and growth prospects could be adversely affected. \n\nA decline in the U.S. government budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects. \n\nRevenues under contracts with the DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community, either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors, represented approximately 44% of our total revenues for fiscal 2022 and 2021, and 49% of our total revenues for fiscal 2020. Levels of U.S. government and DoD spending are difficult to predict and subject to significant risk. Laws and plans adopted by the U.S. government relating to, along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal budget, potential changes in budgetary priorities and defense spending levels, the appropriations process and the permissible federal debt limit, could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the U.S. Presidential Administration and Congress and what challenges potential budget reductions will present for us and our industry generally. \n\nCurrent U.S. government spending levels for defense-related or other programs may not be sustained and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas where we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts. Such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget, increasing political pressure and legislation, shifts in spending priorities from defense-related or other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds, the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors. For example, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in increased security assistance to Ukraine to help preserve its territorial integrity, secure its borders, and improve interoperability with NATO. Changes in defense budgetary priorities as a result of such conflict could have an adverse impact on our results. In addition, if government funding relating to our contracts with the U.S. government or DoD becomes unavailable, or is reduced or delayed, or planned orders are reduced, our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. government or the prime contractor. Our operating results could also be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the U.S. government or the DoD, as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 19 \n\nPART I \n\nThe U.S. government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities, which may shift DoD or other budgetary priorities, reduce overall U.S. government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related or other programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues. In addition, changes to the federal or DoD acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so. A significant decline in overall U.S. government spending, including in the areas of national security, intelligence and homeland security, a significant shift in its spending priorities, the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defense-related programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations and limit our growth prospects. In addition, our ability to grow in advanced technology areas, such as hypersonics programs, space exploration and classified programs, will also be affected by the overall budget environment, whether development programs transition to production and the timing of such transition, all of which are dependent on U.S. Government authorization and funding. \n\nBecause we depend on U.S. government contracts, a delay in the completion of the U.S. government's budget and appropriations process could delay procurement of the products, services and solutions we provide and adversely affect our future revenues. \n\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriations process. In years when the U.S. government does not complete its appropriations before the beginning of the new fiscal year on October 1, government operations are typically funded pursuant to a \"continuing resolution,\" which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous appropriations cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in the procurement of the products, services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being canceled. From time to time, we have experienced a decline in revenues in our fourth quarter as a result of this annual appropriations cycle, and we could experience similar declines in revenues from future delays in the appropriations process. When the U.S. government fails to complete its appropriations process or provide for a continuing resolution, a full or partial federal government shutdown may result. A federal government shutdown could, in turn, result in our incurrence of substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts, the delay or cancellation of key programs or the delay of contract payments, which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results of operations. Congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis for many programs, even though the program performance period may extend over several years. Consequently, programs are often partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless or until additional funds are obligated to the contract. In addition, if and when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the U.S. government or fund specific programs and passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriations bill is delayed, the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected. \n\nDue to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests, we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability. \n\nWe expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a continuing competitive bidding process, including GSA Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, may be split among competitors or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders, and several risks, including the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win. Following contract award, we may encounter significant expense, delay, contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding. Any resulting loss or delay of start-up and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, multi-award contracts require that we make sustained post-award efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. As a result, we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multi-award contracts. We are also experiencing increased competition generally, which impacts our ability to obtain contracts; see the risk factor &#8220;We face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects.&#8221; Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 20 \n\nPART I \n\nThe U.S. government may terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability. \n\nMany of the U.S. government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years. These programs are typically funded on an annual basis. Under our contracts, the U.S. government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience. Any decisions by the U.S. government to not exercise contract options or to terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues, revenue growth and profitability. \n\nWe have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts. Some of our contracts involve developing complex systems and products to achieve challenging customer goals in a competitive procurement environment. As a result, we sometimes experience technological or other performance difficulties, which have in the past and may in the future result in delays, cost overruns and failures in our performance of these contracts. If a government customer terminates a contract for default, we may be exposed to liability, including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and products from another source. Depending on the nature and value of the contract, a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation. \n\nWe face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects. \n\nOur business is highly competitive, and we compete with larger companies with greater name recognition, financial resources and a larger technical staff. We also compete with smaller, more specialized companies that can concentrate their resources on particular areas. Additionally, we compete with the U.S. government&#8217;s own capabilities and federal non-profit contract research centers. For example, some customers, including the DoD, are turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for some products and services, and may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor . The markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing customer needs and technology and our success depends on our ability to invest in and develop services and products that address such needs. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service, technology and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers while understanding customer priorities and maintaining customer relationships. Our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide, including technical qualifications, past contract experience, geographic presence, price and the availability of qualified professional personnel, or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts. \n\nSome of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses or establish teaming or other agreements among themselves or third parties, which could allow them to offer more competitive and comprehensive solutions. As a result of such acquisitions or arrangements, our current or potential competitors may be able to accelerate the adoption of new technologies that better address customer needs, devote more significant resources to bring these products and services to market, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do or limit our access to certain suppliers. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in fewer orders, reduced revenue and margins and loss of market share. Further industry consolidation may also impact customers&#8217; perceptions of the viability of smaller or even mid-size software firms and consequently customers&#8217; willingness to purchase from such firms. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 21 \n\nPART I \n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks \n\nOur failure to comply with various complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties, including termination of our U.S. government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. government contracts and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting. \n\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers. Such laws and regulations may potentially impose added costs on our business and our failure to comply with them may lead to civil or criminal penalties, termination of our U.S. government contracts, or suspension or debarment from contracting with federal agencies. For additional background on the regulations that apply to our business and the related compliance risks, see &#8220;Regulation&#8221; within Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the risk factor &#8220;Our business is subject to governmental review and investigation, which could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and growth prospects .\" The FAR and many of our U.S. government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers. Organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the U.S. government, impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. A conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects. \n\nThe U.S. government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time. \n\nOur industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies and recovery of costs, among other items. From time to time, new laws and regulations are enacted, and government agencies adopt new interpretations and enforcement priorities relative to laws and regulations already in effect. U.S. government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Legislation, regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform, mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability, including regulations that require reductions and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks, as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of U.S. government agencies, such as increased usage of fixed-price contracts, multiple-award contracts and small business set-aside contracts, could have adverse effects on government contractors, including us. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when customers recompete those contracts. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues, profitability and prospects. \n\nAs a U.S. government contractor, our partners and we are subject to reviews, audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which could adversely affect our profitability, cash position or growth prospects if resolved unfavorably to us. \n\nU.S. government contractors (including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business) operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies, including the DCAA, DCMA, the DoD Inspector General and others. These agencies review a contractor's performance on government contracts, cost structure, indirect rates and pricing practices, compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations, terms and standards, and the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements. They also review the adequacy of the contractor&#8217;s compliance with government standards for its business systems, including a contractor's accounting system, earned value management system, estimating system, materials management and accounting system, property management system and purchasing system. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 22 \n\nPART I \n\nAs a result of increased scrutiny on contractors and U.S. government agencies, audits and reviews are conducted rigorously and the applicable standards are strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome. A finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our U.S. government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and the DCMA accepts our remediations. Government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds. Such adjustments can be applied retroactively, which could result in significant customer refunds. Our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an \"approved\" determination of our various business systems from the responsible U.S. government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business, including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process. A determination of noncompliance could also result in the U.S. government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, withholding of payments, the loss of export/import privileges, administrative or civil judgments and liabilities, criminal judgments or convictions, liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements, other sanctions, the assessment of penalties, fines or compensatory, treble or other damages or non-monetary relief or actions, suspension or debarment, suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could negatively impact our reputation, delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government. As of December 30, 2022, indirect cost audits by the DCAA remain open for fiscal 2021 and subsequent fiscal years. Although we have recorded contract revenues based upon our estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review, we cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and, if future adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability may be adversely affected. \n\nOur business is subject to governmental review and investigation, which could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and growth prospects. \n\nWe are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal, state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside the United States. If a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, litigation, civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from sales channels or sales opportunities, injunctions or administrative sanctions, including the termination of contracts, the triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies or other consequences. We may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals. Penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry. If we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation, our revenues, profitability, cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected. More generally, increases in scrutiny and investigations from government organizations, legislative bodies or agencies into business practices and major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation, revenues, profitability and growth prospects. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings \" along with \"Note 21&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nInvestigations, audits, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend, which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability, and could damage our reputation. \n\nWe are subject to and may become a party to various other litigation, claims, investigations, audits, enforcement actions, arbitrations or other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation could be costly to defend, and even if we are successful or fully indemnified or insured, they could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future, and responding to any action may result in a significant diversion of management's attention and resources. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management&#8217;s view of these matters may change in the future. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings \" along with \"Note 21&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 23 \n\nPART I \n\nOur business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements, and any violation of these requirements could harm our business. \n\nWe are subject to numerous state, federal and international laws and directives and regulations in the U.S. and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including data privacy and security, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import-export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. Compliance with legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. We also conduct business in certain identified growth areas, such as health information technology, energy and environmental services, which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk. Violations of one or more of these legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations. \n\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security which could subject us to investigations, claims or monetary penalties against us, require us to change our business practices or otherwise adversely affect our revenues and profitability. \n\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S., at the federal, state and local levels and abroad relating to data privacy and security. These laws and regulations are complex, constantly evolving, and may be subject to significant change in the future. In addition, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in new and rapidly evolving areas of technology, and may differ in material respects among jurisdictions, interpreted and applied inconsistently among jurisdictions or in a manner that is inconsistent with our current policies and practices, all of which can make compliance challenging and costly, and expose us to related risks and liabilities. \n\nAs a contractor supporting defense, health care, and national security clients, we are also subject to certain additional, specific regulatory compliance requirements relating to data privacy and security. Under DFARS and other federal regulations, we are required to implement the security and privacy controls in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publications on certain of our networks and information technology systems. To the extent that we do not comply with applicable security and control requirements, and there is unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information (including personal information), this could potentially result in a contract termination or information security issues, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and lead to reputational harm. We will also be subject to the DoD Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (&#8220;CMMC&#8221;) requirements, which will require contractors processing critical national security information on their information technology systems to receive specific third-party certifications relating to specified cybersecurity standards to be eligible for contract awards. In addition, our subcontractors, and in some cases our vendors, also may be required to adhere to the CMMC program requirements and, potentially, to achieve certification. Should our supply chain fail to meet compliance requirements or achieve certification, this may adversely affect our ability to receive awards or execute on relevant government programs. We are in the process of evaluating our readiness and preparing for the CMMC, but to the extent we are unable to achieve certification in advance of contract awards that specify the requirement in the future, we will be unable to bid on such contract awards or follow-on awards for existing work with the DoD, depending on the level of standard as required for each solicitation, which could adversely impact our revenue and profitability. In addition, any obligations that may be imposed on us under the CMMC may be different from or in addition to those otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations, which may cause additional expense for compliance. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 24 \n\nPART I \n\nThe overarching complexity of data privacy and security laws and regulations around the world poses a compliance challenge that could manifest in costs, damages or liability in other forms as a result of failure to implement proper programmatic controls, failure to adhere to those controls, or the breach of applicable data privacy and security requirements by us, our employees, our business partners (including our service providers, suppliers or subcontractors) or our customers. We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning data privacy and security, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards, or amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws, regulations or standards, may have on our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us, our service providers, suppliers, subcontractors or other business partners to comply with applicable laws, regulations, our public privacy policies and other public statements about data privacy and security and other obligations in these areas could result in regulatory or government actions lawsuits against us (including civil claims, such as representative actions and other class action-type litigation), legal liability, monetary penalties, fines, sanctions, damages and other costs, orders to cease or change our processing of data, changes to our business practices, diversion of internal resources, and harm to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also incur substantial expenses in implementing and maintaining compliance with such laws, regulations and other obligations. For additional background on the data privacy and security laws that apply to our business and the related compliance risks, see &#8220;Regulation&#8221; within Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nBusiness and Operational Risks \n\nThe extent to which our business will be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n\nA disease pandemic, such as COVID-19 and its variants, or other widespread health epidemics, pandemics or similar outbreaks could create economic uncertainty and disruptions to the global economy that could adversely affect our businesses, or could lead to operational difficulties, including travel limitations, that could impair our ability to manage or conduct our business. \n\nIn addition, the global spread of COVID-19 resulted in a substantial decline in demand for air travel, which adversely impacted the demand for products and services related to our airport security detection and automation business. We are not able to predict whether COVID-19 will result in permanent changes to air travel behaviors, including a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of the increased use of teleconferencing products and, more broadly, a general reluctance by consumers to travel, each of which has, and could continue to, impact our business. Further, new contract awards have been and may continue to be delayed and our ability to perform on our existing contracts has been and may continue to be delayed or impaired, which will negatively impact our revenues. In addition, our program costs have increased as a result of COVID-19, and these cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance or equitable adjustments to contract prices. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 25 \n\nPART I \n\nMisconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures and others working on our behalf could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation. \n\nMisconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Act, and the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal, state or local government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health or safety matters, bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations. Any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory investigations or sanctions against us, corruption or disruption of our systems or those of our customers, impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers, loss of current and future contracts, indemnity obligations, serious harm to our reputation and other potential liabilities. See also the risk factor &#8220;Cybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results, impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position . &#8221; Although we have implemented policies, procedures, training and other compliance controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct, and as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. This risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand and do business with new partners. In the ordinary course of our business, we form and are members of joint ventures (meaning joint efforts or business arrangements of any type). Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could damage our reputation and subject us to administrative, civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts, loss of privileges and other sanctions, including suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business, reputation and our future results. \n\nA failure to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled employees, including our management team, would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations. \n\nOur continued success and ability to compete in a highly competitive environment depend on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled science, engineering, technical, math and professional personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and the costs associated with attracting and retaining them is high and made even more competitive as a result of the external environment, including increasing rates of job transition and low unemployment. In addition, many U.S. government programs require contractors to have security clearances, certain of which can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and personnel with such security clearances are in great demand. As a result, it is difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner, which may affect our growth. Although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to attract, effectively train and retain these employees. Any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers&#8217; needs and win new business, which could adversely affect our future results. In addition, certain personnel may be required to receive various security clearances to work on certain customer engagements or to perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed or not obtained, which may negatively impact our ability to perform on such engagements in a timely matter or at all. We believe our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business, generate new business, execute on our business plans in an efficient and effective manner, and continually develop new members of senior management. An inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives or our failure to continue to develop new members could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities. \n\nWe may not realize the full amounts reflected in our backlog as revenues, which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects. \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, our total backlog was $35.8 billion, including $8.4 billion in funded backlog. Due to the U.S. government's ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate, modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our non-U.S. government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances, we may realize less than expected revenues or may never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog. Our unfunded backlog, in particular, contains management&#8217;s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues. If we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog, our future revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 26 \n\nPART I \n\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to estimate and manage costs, time and resources accurately. \n\nWe generate revenues under various types of contracts, including cost-reimbursement, FP-IF, T&#38;M, FP-LOE and FFP contracts. Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or products provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive-fee and award-fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost-reimbursement and T&#38;M contracts are generally less profitable than FFP contracts. Our operating results in any period may also be affected, positively or negatively, by customers' variable purchasing patterns of our more profitable proprietary products. \n\nOur profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers. To varying degrees, each of our contract types involves some risk underestimating the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. Revenues from FFP contracts represented approximately 38% of our total revenues for fiscal 2022. When making proposals on these types of contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects, as well as assumptions regarding technical issues. In each case, our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance could result, and in some instances has resulted, in reduced profits or losses. More generally, any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the performance of our contracts, including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control, such as performance failures of our subcontractors, rising inflationary pressures and fluctuations in interest rates, natural disasters or other force majeure events, could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable. \n\nWe use estimates in recognizing revenues, and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected. \n\nWe recognize revenue on our service-based contracts primarily over time as there is a continuous transfer of control to the customer throughout the contract as we perform the promised services, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process, particularly due to the technical nature of the services performed and the long-term nature of certain contracts, is complex and involves significant judgment. Adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results. For a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Report, &#8220;Note 3&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 27 \n\nPART I \n\nCybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results, impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position. \n\nAs a government contractor and a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies, we and our service providers, suppliers and subcontractors collect, store, transmit and otherwise process personal, confidential, proprietary and sensitive information, including protected health information, personnel information, personal information, classified information, controlled unclassified information, intellectual property and financial information, concerning our business, employees and customers. Therefore, we are continuously exposed to unauthorized attempts to compromise access, release or otherwise compromise such information through cyber-attacks and other information security threats, including, among other things, physical break-ins, theft, denial-of-service attacks, worms, computer viruses, software bugs, malicious or destructive code, social engineering, phishing attacks and impersonating authorized users, credential stuffing, account takeovers, insider threats, malfeasance or improper access by employees or service providers, human error, fraud, use of artificial intelligence, &#8220;bots&#8221; or other automation software, or other similar disruptions. We are also exposed to hackers that have requested &#8220;ransom&#8221; in exchange for not disclosing information or for restoring access to information or systems. These techniques may be perpetrated by internal bad actors, such as employees or contractors, or by third parties (including traditional computer hackers, persons involved with well-funded organized crime or state-sponsored actors). Any electronic or physical break-in or other security breach or compromise of our information technology systems and networks or facilities, or those of our service providers, suppliers, joint ventures or subcontractors, may jeopardize the security of information, including personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive information, stored or transmitted through these systems and networks or stored in those facilities. This could lead to disruptions in mission-critical systems, unauthorized access to or release of personal, confidential, proprietary, sensitive or otherwise protected information and corruption of data or systems. We could also be potentially subject to operational downtimes and delays and other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers. We are also increasingly subject to customer-driven cybersecurity certification requirements, which are expected to be necessary to win future contracts. Such security incidents also could result in liability or trigger other obligations under such contracts or increase the difficulty of winning future contracts. Many statutory requirements, both in the U.S. and abroad, also include obligations for companies to provide notice of information security incidents involving certain types of information (including obligations to notify affected individuals and regulators in the event of cybersecurity breaches involving certain personal information), which could result from breaches of our service providers, our suppliers or subcontractors. \n\nAlthough we have implemented policies, procedures and controls designed to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats and attacks, we and our service providers, suppliers, joint ventures and subcontractors have faced and continue to face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems. We cannot guarantee that future incidents will not occur, and if an incident does occur, our incident response planning may not prove fully adequate. We may also not be able to mitigate its impacts successfully. Techniques used by others to gain unauthorized access to personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive information or disrupt systems and networks for economic or strategic gain are constantly evolving, increasingly sophisticated, and increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against. Recently, the U.S. government has raised concerns about a potential increase in cyber-attacks generally as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries. \n\nWhile we generally perform cybersecurity diligence on our key service providers, we do not control our service providers and our ability to monitor their cybersecurity is limited, so we cannot ensure the cybersecurity measures they take will be sufficient to protect any information we share with them. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity breaches or other information security incidents attributed to our service providers as they relate to the information we share with them. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 28 \n\nPART I \n\nWe seek to detect and investigate all information security incidents and to prevent their occurrence, prolongation or recurrence. We continue to invest in and improve our threat protection, detection and mitigation policies, procedures and controls. In addition, we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against information security and malicious insider threats. However, because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats, which can be difficult to detect, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls, or those of our service providers, suppliers or subcontractors, have protected against, detected, mitigated or will detect, prevent or mitigate, any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident. We may be currently unaware of certain vulnerabilities or lack the capability to detect them, which may allow them to persist in our information technology environment over long periods and, even if discovered, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised, and our remediation efforts may not be completely successful. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities, cybersecurity breaches or other information security incidents. \n\nWe also may experience similar security threats to the information technology systems that we develop, install or maintain under customer contracts. Although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners, including our service providers, suppliers and subcontractors, to seek to minimize the potential for and impact of cyber-attacks and other security threats, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities. See also the risk factor &#8220;Internal system or service failures, or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability . &#8221; \n\nThe occurrence of any unauthorized access to, attacks on cybersecurity breaches of other information security threats to our or our service providers', suppliers' or subcontractors' information technology infrastructure, systems or networks or data, or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosure to the public, regulators, or law enforcement agencies following any such event, could disrupt our infrastructure, systems, or networks or those of our customers, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and may jeopardize the security of data collected, stored, transmitted or otherwise processed through our information technology infrastructure, systems and networks. As a result, we could be exposed to claims, fines, penalties, loss of revenues, product development delays, compromise, corruption or loss of confidential, proprietary or sensitive information (including personal information or technical business information), contract terminations and damages, remediation costs and other costs and expenses, regulatory investigations or sanctions, indemnity obligations and other potential liabilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our reputation, ability to win work on sensitive contracts or loss of current and future contracts (including sensitive U.S. government contracts), business operations and financial results. We have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks; however, our insurer may deny coverage as to any future claim, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event, and such insurance may increase in cost or cease to be available on commercial terms in the future. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 29 \n\nPART I \n\nInternal system or service failures, or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. \n\nAny system or service disruptions, including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and networks and the delivery of services, whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could materially and adversely affect our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to perform on contracts, bill our customers for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. We, and the service providers, suppliers and subcontractors on which we rely, are also subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats, malicious insiders, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other events, which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications, or those of our service providers, suppliers or subcontractors, could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption. \n\nOur business is subject to disruption caused by physical or transition risks that could adversely affect our operations, profitability and overall financial position. \n\nWe have significant operations, including infrastructure, information technology systems, research facilities and centers of excellence, located in regions that may be exposed to physical risks, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, other damaging storms, water levels, wildfires and other natural disasters, including places such as Alabama, Florida, California and Texas. Our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to physical risks that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract, including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, could decrease demand for our services, could make existing customers unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual requirements to us, including their payment obligations, and could cause us to incur substantial expense, including expenses or liabilities arising from potential litigation. If insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nThere is also an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. In addition to physical risks, climate change risk includes longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. We could also incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and supply chain and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the effects of climate change. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market initiatives. Such changes could result in laws, regulations or policies that significantly increase our direct and indirect operational and compliance burdens, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We monitor developments in climate change-related laws, regulations and policies for their potential effect on us, however, we currently are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential costs associated with such developments. \n\nIn addition, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our clients&#8217; involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 30 \n\nPART I \n\nCustomer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. \n\nMany of the systems and networks that we develop, install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. While we have programs designed to comply with relevant data privacy and security laws and restrictions, if a system or network that we develop, install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats or other events, we may experience loss of revenue, remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination. Any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected. \n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to work with complex and rapidly changing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. \n\nWe design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in various environments. The needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and in particular by complex and rapidly evolving technologies. Our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop technologically advanced, innovative and cost-effective products and services and market these products and services to our customers. Our success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components. Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or depend on factors not wholly within our control. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving such contractual requirements. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects. In addition, our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability, such as problems with quality and workmanship, country of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services, unplanned degradation of product performance, and unauthorized use or modifications of our products and services. Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the government customer of contract costs and fee payments we previously received. \n\nWe have classified contracts with the U.S. government, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business. \n\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the U.S. government and its agencies that are subject to security restrictions (e.g., contracts involving classified information and classified programs), which preclude the dissemination of information and technology that is classified for national security purposes under applicable law and regulation. In general, access to classified information, technology, facilities or programs requires appropriate personnel security clearances, is subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability and may also require appropriate facility clearances and other specialized infrastructure. In the event of a security incident involving classified information, technology, facilities, programs or personnel holding clearances, we may be subject to legal, financial, operational and reputational harm. We are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified business or our business overall. However, historically the business risks associated with our work on classified programs have not differed materially from those of our other government contracts. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 31 \n\nPART I \n\nWe have made and continue to make acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nWe selectively pursue strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our products or our ability to provide services. These transactions require a significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities. Even if successful, these transactions could result in unfavorable public perception or reduce earnings for a number of reasons, including the amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges, adverse tax consequences, acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earn-out arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected. Acquisitions, investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial results, including that: \n\n&#8226; we may not be able to identify, compete effectively for or complete suitable acquisitions and investments at prices we consider attractive; \n\n&#8226; we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions and investments on our business or realize anticipated synergies, business growth or profitability and may be unable to recover investments in any such acquisitions and investments; \n\n&#8226; we may not be able to manage the integration process for acquisitions successfully, and the integration process may divert management time and focus from operating our business, including as a result of incompatible accounting, information management or other control systems; \n\n&#8226; acquired technologies, capabilities, products and service offerings, particularly those that are still in development when acquired, may not perform as expected, may have defects or may not be integrated into our business as expected; \n\n&#8226; we may have trouble retaining key employees and customers of an acquired business; \n\n&#8226; we may need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and policies, including those relating to financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies; \n\n&#8226; we may assume legal or regulatory risks, particularly with respect to smaller businesses that have immature business processes and compliance programs, or may be required to comply with additional laws and regulations, or to engage in remediation efforts to cause the acquired company to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or result in liabilities resulting from the acquired company&#8217;s failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations; \n\n&#8226; we may face litigation or material liabilities that were not identified or were underestimated as part of our due diligence or for which we are unable to receive a purchase price adjustment or reimbursement through indemnification, including intellectual property claims and disputes or claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties, or there may be other unanticipated write-offs or charges; \n\n&#8226; we may be required to spend a significant amount of cash or to incur debt, resulting in limitations on other potential uses for cash, increased fixed payment obligations or covenants or other restrictions on us, or issue shares of our common stock or convertible debt, resulting in dilution of ownership; \n\n&#8226; we may not be able to influence the operations of our joint ventures effectively, or we may be exposed to certain liabilities if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations; and \n\n&#8226; if our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures fail, perform poorly, or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason, including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, we periodically divest businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require a significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification, guarantee or other financial arrangements, for a period of time following the transaction, which would adversely affect our financial results. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 32 \n\nPART I \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent significant assets on our balance sheet and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations. \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, goodwill and intangible assets, net was 59% of our total assets . The amount of our goodwill may substantially increase in the future as a result of any acquisitions that we make. Intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually in the case of intangible assets with indefinite lives. The impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, adverse contract acquisition performance, loss of key personnel, or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed. Adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions, such as those related to federal budget cuts and the nation&#8217;s debt ceiling, deteriorating market conditions for companies in our industry and unfavorable changes in discount rates could result in an impairment of goodwill and other intangibles. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. For additional information on our accounting policies related to impairment of goodwill, see our discussion under &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, \"Note 3&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and &#8220;Note 8&#8212;Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nWe depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors. If we are not able to maintain these relationships, or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer, our revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected. \n\nWe rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors, who are also often our competitors in other contexts, to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and other companies will help us to win and perform the contract. Our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us or if the U.S. government terminates or reduces these other contractors&#8217; programs, does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract. Companies that do not have access to U.S. government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor, and that exposure could enhance such companies&#8217; prospect of securing a future position as a prime U.S. government contractor, which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts. We may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of a subcontractor&#8217;s personnel or the subcontractor&#8217;s failure to comply with applicable law. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized. Significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default. A termination for default could eliminate a revenue source, expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders, especially if the customer is an agency of the U.S. government. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 33 \n\nPART I \n\nOur services and operations, which sometimes involve using, handling, or disposing of hazardous substances, are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, pursuant to which we could face potentially significant liabilities, costs or obligations. \n\nOur services are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Some of our services and operations involve using, handling, or disposing of hazardous substances. These activities and our operations generally subject us to complex and stringent foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which have tended to become more stringent over time. Among other things, these laws and regulations require us to incur costs to comply and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances. For example, we provide infrastructure and site services necessary to accomplish critical waste management and the continued environmental cleanup of the Hanford Site in southeastern Washington. In addition, some of our work sites put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. On some work sites, we may be responsible for safety and have an obligation to implement effective safety procedures. If we fail to implement these procedures, or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, we may suffer the loss of or injury to our employees, as well as expose ourselves to possible litigation. \n\nFailure to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative, or contractual sanctions, including fines, penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards and equipment could result in reduced profitability and loss of work or clients. Our current and previous ownership and operation of real property also subject us to environmental laws and regulations, some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property jointly and severally liable for hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases. Past business practices at companies that we have acquired may also expose us to future unknown environmental liabilities. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, or violations of these laws or regulations, could result in substantial costs to us, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Our continuing work in the areas governed by these laws and regulations exposes us to the risk of substantial liability and may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nWe could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats. \n\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell, service, and maintain various inspection systems and related integration and automation systems designed to assist in detecting bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats. In some instances, we also train operators of such systems. Such systems utilize detection technology and software algorithms to interpret data produced by the system and signal to the operator when a dangerous object or substance may be present. Such algorithms are probabilistic in nature and are generally designed to meet requirements established by regulatory agencies. Many of these systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag, parcel, container, vehicle or other vessel. Others signal to the operator that further investigation is required, and the training, reliability and competence of the customer's operator are crucial to the detection of suspicious items. Nevertheless, if such a system were to fail to signal to an operator when an explosive or other contraband was, in fact, present, resulting in significant damage, we could become the subject of significant product liability claims. There are many factors, some of which are beyond our control, which could result in the failure of our products to help detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats. Some of these factors could include inherent limitations in our systems and misuse or malfunction of our systems. The failure of our systems to help detect the presence of any of these dangerous materials could lead to injury, death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability, professional liability or other claims against us. Further, if our security and inspection systems fail to, or are perceived to have failed to, help detect a threat, we could experience negative publicity and reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our inspection or detection systems, and adversely affect our business. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 34 \n\nPART I \n\nOur insurance, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses. \n\nWe maintain insurance coverage with third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. Not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance, and, for those risks we insure, the limits of coverage that are reasonably obtainable may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred. We are limited in the amount of insurance we can obtain to cover certain risks, such as cybersecurity risks and natural hazards, including earthquakes, fires, extreme weather conditions, some of which can be worsened by climate change and pandemics. If any of our third-party insurers fail, becomes insolvent, cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase, and the management of our business operations would be disrupted. Our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant product and other liability claims or losses. Moreover, there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. In some circumstances we are entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions, laws, regulations or otherwise. However, these protections are not always available, can be difficult to obtain, are typically subject to certain terms or limitations, including the availability of funds, and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred. If liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage, customer indemnifications or other legal protections, our business, financial position, operating results and prospects may be harmed. Any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation, leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our products and services and reduced revenues, making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could affect the cost and availability of insurance coverage at adequate levels in the future. \n\nWe face risks associated with our international business. \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, revenue attributable to our services provided outside of the United States to non-U.S. customers was approximately 8% of our total revenue. Our international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our U.S. business. These risks and challenges include: \n\n&#8226; failure to comply with U.S. government and foreign laws and regulations applicable to international business, including, without limitation, those related to employment, data privacy and cybersecurity, taxes, technology transfer, information security, environment, data transfer, import and export controls (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&#8220;ITAR&#8221;) administered by the U.S. Department of State and the anti-boycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (&#8220;EAR&#8221;) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security), sanctions, and other administrative, legislative or regulatory actions that could materially interfere with our ability to offer our products or services in certain countries or have an adverse impact on our business with the U.S. government, and expose us to risks and costs of noncompliance with such laws and regulations, in addition to administrative, civil or criminal penalties; \n\n&#8226; increased financial and legal risks arising, for example, from foreign exchange rate variability, imposition of tariffs or additional taxes, inflation, restrictive trade policies, longer payment cycles, delays or failures to collect amounts due to us and differing legal systems, and which may adversely affect the performance of our services, sale of our products or repatriation of our profits; \n\n&#8226; political or economic instability, international security concerns and geopolitical conflict in countries where we provide services and products in support of the U.S. government and other customers in countries, which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life, damage or destruction of property, inability to meet our contractual obligations or retaliatory measures taken in respect thereof; and \n\n&#8226; the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in the imposition by the U.S. and other nations of restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and certain banks, companies and individuals. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 35 \n\nPART I \n\nWe are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (the &#8220;UK Bribery Act&#8221;) and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we do business. These laws and regulations generally prohibit improper payments or offers of improper payments to government officials, political parties, or commercial partners to obtain or retain business or secure an improper business advantage. We have operations, deal with and make sales to governmental or quasi-governmental entities in non-U.S. countries, including those known to experience corruption, and further expansion of our non-U.S. sales efforts may involve additional regions. In many countries, particularly countries with developing economies, it may be common for businesses to engage in practices prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. Our activities in these countries pose a heightened risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or third-party business partners, representatives, and agents that could violate various laws, including the FCPA. The FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for acts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities, and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees or such third parties even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. The FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have implemented policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees or other third parties working on our behalf have not engaged or will not engage in conduct in violation of our policies or applicable law for which we might ultimately be held responsible. \n\nViolations of any of these laws or regulations, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, may result in whistleblower complaints, negative media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions, including suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting. We may also be subject to other liabilities and adverse effects on our reputation, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues, we are seeking to grow our international business. Our exposure for violating these laws will increase as our non-U.S. presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. \n\nFor additional information regarding government investigations and reviews that we are subject to, see \"Government Investigations and Reviews\" in &#8220;Note 21&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nWe have only a limited ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights, which are important to our success. Our failure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position. \n\nWe rely on a combination of confidentiality, intellectual property and other contractual arrangements, including licenses and copyright, trademark and trade secret law to protect much of our proprietary information and intellectual property in cases where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, third parties may attempt to obtain, copy, use or disclose our intellectual property or other proprietary information or technology without our authorization. In addition to protection under the law and contractual arrangements with our corporate and joint venture partners, employees, consultants, advisors, service providers, suppliers, subcontractors and customers, we generally attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Although our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations and use restrictions, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent them from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our confidential information, technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, and can be difficult to enforce. In addition, trade secrets are generally difficult to protect and some courts inside and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 36 \n\nPART I \n\nWe may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others, invalidated, narrowed in scope or held unenforceable through administrative process or litigation in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. We may be required to expend significant resources and efforts to monitor and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and we may conclude that, in at least some instances, the benefits of protecting our intellectual property or other proprietary rights may be outweighed by the expense or distraction to our management. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights, but outcomes in any such litigation can be difficult to predict, and could be time-consuming, result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Additionally, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. If we are unable to detect or prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our rights in our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other proprietary rights or information, our competitive position could be adversely affected. Also, in connection with our performance of services for the U.S. government, the U.S. government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material and intellectual property that we develop under government-funded contracts and subcontracts, which means that the U.S. government may disclose or license our information and intellectual property to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors. Any exercise by the U.S. government of such rights could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We also may be limited in our ability to disclose or license such information and intellectual property to third parties and the U.S. government may also decline to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms. \n\nThird parties may also, from time to time, claim that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against our customers or us, or we may face allegations that we or our service providers, suppliers, subcontractors, or customers have violated the intellectual property rights of others. Even if we believe that intellectual property-related claims are without merit, litigation may be necessary to determine the scope and validity of intellectual property or proprietary rights of others or to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. If, with respect to any claim against us for violation of third-party intellectual property rights, we are unable to prevail in the litigation, retain or obtain sufficient rights, develop non-infringing solutions or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost-efficient basis, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Such claims also could subject us to injunctions and significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party's intellectual property rights. In addition, our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide. Besides the expense and time to defend such claims and the cost of any large indemnity payments, any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations also could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing and new customers, require us to pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, and divert management&#8217;s attention, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax expense and adversely affect our financial results. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years, which likely will materially decrease our cash from operations unless Congress defers, modifies or repeals this provision with retroactive effect. See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the impact of this change. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, or an ultimate determination that we owe more taxes than the amounts previously accrued, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 37 \n\nPART I \n\nRisks Relating to Our Stock \n\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay or increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase shares of our common stock. \n\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board and depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, cash deployment alternatives, earnings, financial condition, operating results and capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board considers relevant. Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with employee benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce cash, net earnings and stockholders' equity. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under Board-approved share repurchase plans is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or to borrow money from available financing sources, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and applicable law. Our payment of dividends and share repurchases could vary from historical practices or our stated expectations. A change in our dividend or share repurchase programs could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. \n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor. \n\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. These restrictions, which may also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors not endorsed by our current directors and management, include mergers and certain other business combinations between a related person and us requiring approval by the holders of a majority of the voting power of such securities that are not owned by the related person unless approved by a majority of continuing directors or certain other exceptions; our stockholders may not act by written consent; our Board may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be determined by the Board; and we are also subject to certain restrictions on business combinations under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\"), which imposes additional requirements for business combinations, and may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

We currently intend to continue paying dividends on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future dividends will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results and capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that the Board of Directors considers relevant.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion and analysis of Leidos Holdings, Inc.'s (\"Leidos\") financial condition, results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about business environment and trends and market risk should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221; You should also review the disclosure under Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. \n\nUnless indicated otherwise, references in this report to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer collectively to Leidos and its consolidated subsidiaries. \n\nIn this section, we discuss our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations for the year ended December 30, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. For a discussion and analysis comparing our results for the year ended December 31, 2021, to the year ended January 1, 2021, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 15, 2022, under Part II, Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a FORTUNE 500 &#174; technology, engineering, and science company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets, both domestically and internationally. We bring domain-specific capabilities and innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging five technical core capabilities: digital modernization, cyber operations, mission software systems, integrated systems and mission operations. Our customers include the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and many other U.S. civilian, state and local government agencies, foreign government agencies and commercial businesses. Approximately 8% of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated by or owned by entities located outside of the United States. We operate in three reportable segments: Defense Solutions, Civil and Health. Additionally, we separately present the unallocable costs associated with corporate functions as Corporate. \n\nEffective July 3, 2021, certain contracts were reassigned from the Defense Solutions reportable segment to the Civil reportable segment. Impact on the first half of fiscal 2021 segment results were determined to be immaterial and have not been recast to reflect this change. \n\nFor additional information regarding our reportable segments, see &#8220;Business&#8221; in Part I and \"Note 20&#8212;Business Segments\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nOur significant initiatives include the following: \n\n&#8226; achieving annual revenue growth through internal collaboration and better leveraging of key differentiators across our company and the deployment of resources and investments into higher growth markets; \n\n&#8226; increasing headcount and internal direct labor content on our contract portfolio; \n\n&#8226; continued improvement in our back-office infrastructure and related business processes for greater effectiveness and efficiency across all business functions; and \n\n&#8226; disciplined deployment of our cash resources and use of our capital structure to enhance shareholder value while retaining an appropriate amount of financial leverage. \n\nSales Trend. For fiscal 2022, revenues increased $0.7 billion, or 5%, compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to a net increase in volumes on certain programs, program wins and a net increase in revenues related to our business acquisitions. We also received $28 million in recoveries related to stop work orders on certain programs as a result of COVID-19. The increase was partially offset by the completion of certain contracts and unfavorable exchange rate movements. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 44 \n\nPART II \n\nOperating Expenses and Income Trend. For fiscal 2022, operating expenses increased by $0.7 billion, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2021. Operating margin for fiscal 2022 was 7.6% compared to 8.4% for fiscal 2021. Operating income was $1,088 million, a $64 million decrease compared to fiscal 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to the completion of certain contracts, increase in legal fees and settlement costs and impairment charges of $37 million related to our ongoing facility rationalization efforts. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by program wins and $28 million in recoveries related to stop work orders on certain programs as a result of COVID-19. \n\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, our industry is under general competitive pressures associated with spending from our largest customer, the U.S. government, and requires a high level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive. Although the U.S. Presidential Administration has not indicated a desire to reduce spending in the defense and homeland security sectors, the likelihood, extent and duration of current spending levels in these areas remains unclear. We continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary. \n\nCOVID-19 \n\nFor fiscal 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact to revenues and operating income, other than the receipt of $28 million in recoveries, within our Health segment related to stop work orders on certain programs. The volume of global passenger air travel remains below pre-pandemic levels, which continues to impact the operations of our Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute on programs in the expected timeframe, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and the distribution of vaccines, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n\nBusiness Environment and Trends \n\nU.S. Government Markets \n\nIn fiscal 2022, we generated approximately 86% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government. Revenues under contracts with the DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community, including subcontracts under which the DoD or the U.S. Intelligence Community is the ultimate purchaser, represented approximately 44% of our total revenues for fiscal 2022. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending, especially national security, homeland security and intelligence spending, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. government. \n\nPresident Biden signed the $1.7 trillion GFY 2023 omnibus spending bill into law on December 29, 2022. The omnibus spending bill funds the federal government through September 30, 2023. The bill includes $772.5 billion in non-defense spending and $858.4 billion in defense spending. The bill also includes $85 billion in emergency spending not included in the discretionary amount. The new 118th Congress will begin to work on the GFY 2024 appropriations bills in the spring of 2023. \n\nTrends in the U.S. government contracting process, including a shift towards multiple-awards contracts, in which certain contractors are preapproved using IDIQ and U.S. General Services Administration (\"GSA\") contract vehicles, have increased competition for U.S. government contracts, reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts and increased pricing pressure. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nInternational Markets \n\nSales to customers in international markets represented approximately 8% of total revenues for fiscal 2022. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies. Our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory, foreign currency exchange rate and geopolitical risks. \n\nChanges in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials, may increase our procurement costs of certain IT hardware used both on our contracts and for internal use. However, we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our cost-plus contracts. While we evaluate the impact of higher tariffs, currently, we do not expect tariffs to have a significant impact to our business. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 45 \n\nPART II \n\nKey Performance Measures \n\nThe primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations and diluted earnings per share. Bookings and backlog are also useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues. In addition, we consider business performance by contract type to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating income and margin performance. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nOur results of operations for the periods presented were as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended 2022 to 2021 &#160; December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Dollar change Percent change &#160; (dollars in millions) Revenues \n\n$ 14,396 &#160; $ 13,737 $ 659 5 % Cost of revenues 12,312 &#160; 11,723 589 5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 950 &#160; 860 90 10 % Credit losses (recoveries), net 1 &#160; (9) 10 (111) % Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs \n\n17 &#160; 27 (10) (37) % Asset impairment charges \n\n40 &#160; 4 36 NM Equity earnings of non-consolidated subsidiaries \n\n(12) (20) 8 (40) % Operating income \n\n1,088 &#160; 1,152 (64) (6) % Non-operating expense, net \n\n(202) (185) (17) 9 % Income before income taxes \n\n886 &#160; 967 (81) (8) % Income tax expense \n\n(193) (208) 15 (7) % Net income \n\n693 &#160; 759 (66) (9) % Less: net income attributable to non-controlling interest 8 &#160; 6 2 33 % Net income attributable to Leidos common stockholders $ 685 &#160; $ 753 $ (68) (9) % Operating income margin \n\n7.6 &#160; % 8.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNM - Not meaningful \n\nSegment and Corporate Results ##TABLE_START Year Ended 2022 to 2021 Defense Solutions December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Dollar change Percent change &#160; (dollars in millions) Revenues $ 8,244 &#160; $ 8,032 $ 212 3 % Operating income 541 &#160; 569 (28) (5) % Operating income margin \n\n6.6 &#160; % 7.1 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in revenues for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to program wins, a net increase in volumes on certain programs and a $63 million net increase in revenues related to our acquisitions made in the second and third quarters from the prior year and the Cobham Special Mission acquisition made in the current year.

The increase was partially offset by the completion of certain contracts and $12 million of unfavorable exchange rate movements. \n\nThe decrease in operating income for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to a $19 million increase in legal fees and settlement costs resulting from an adverse arbitration ruling related to the 2016 acquisition of the Information Systems &#38; Global Solutions business (&#8220;IS&#38;GS Business&#8221;) from Lockheed Martin and impairment charges of $14 million related to our ongoing facility rationalization efforts (see \"Note 10&#8212;Leases\"). The decreases were partially offset by a net increase in program volumes.

For fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 we recorded earnings of $12 million and $20 million, respectively, from our equity method investments. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 47 \n\nPART II \n\nNon-Operating Expense, Net \n\nNon-operating expense, net increased $17 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher interest expense driven by increased interest rates. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate was 21.8%, and 21.5% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were both favorably impacted primarily by federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions. \n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\") eliminated the option to currently deduct certain research and development costs for tax purposes and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research costs over five years. Based upon our interpretation of the law as enacted, we recorded the estimated fiscal 2022 impact, resulting in increases of $130 million to both our income taxes payable and net deferred tax assets, and our fiscal 2022 unrecognized tax benefits increased by $91 million with a corresponding increase to net deferred tax assets. We expect this TCJA provision to have a similar impact to income taxes payable, unrecognized tax benefits and net deferred tax assets during fiscal 2023. The actual impact will depend on the amount of research and development costs the Company will incur, whether Congress modifies or repeals this provision and whether new guidance and interpretive rules are issued by the U.S. Treasury, among other factors. \n\nBookings and Backlog \n\nWe had net bookings of $15.4 billion and $15.5 billion during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards that were received during the year, net of any adjustments to previously awarded backlog amounts. We calculate net bookings as the year&#8217;s ending backlog, plus the year&#8217;s revenues, less the prior year&#8217;s ending backlog and any impacts from foreign currency or acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nBacklog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts. We segregate our backlog into two categories as follows: \n\n&#8226; Funded Backlog. Funded backlog for contracts with the U.S. government represents the value on contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Funded backlog for contracts with non-U.S. government entities and commercial customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which we are obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on the contracts. \n\n&#8226; Negotiated Unfunded Backlog. Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include unexercised option periods and future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles, with the exception of certain IDIQ contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded and separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism, and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future anticipated task orders. \n\nThe estimated value of our total backlog for the periods presented was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Segment Funded Unfunded Total Funded Unfunded Total (in millions) Defense Solutions $ 4,442 &#160; $ 14,155 &#160; $ 18,597 &#160; $ 4,393 $ 15,274 $ 19,667 Civil 1,876 &#160; 8,790 &#160; 10,666 &#160; 1,628 7,903 9,531 Health 2,064 &#160; 4,455 &#160; 6,519 &#160; 1,428 3,829 5,257 Total $ 8,382 &#160; $ 27,400 &#160; $ 35,782 &#160; $ 7,449 $ 27,006 $ 34,455 ##TABLE_END\n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 48 \n\nPART II \n\nTotal backlog at December 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $610 million and $800 million, respectively, of backlog acquired during the year through business combinations in our Defense Solutions reportable segment. \n\nThe increase in backlog as of December 30, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021, included an unfavorable impact of $233 million due to the movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar. \n\nBookings and backlog fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards, renewals, modifications and cancellations, as well as foreign currency movements. Contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industry-wide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the U.S. government as discussed in &#8220;Business Environment and Trends&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nWe expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. government. In addition, certain contracts with commercial or non-U.S. government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. \n\nContract Types \n\nOur earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract. For a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenues, see &#8220;Business&#8212;Contract Types&#8221; in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues by contract type as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods presented were as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended &#160; December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 January 1, 2021 Cost-reimbursement and fixed-price-incentive-fee 50 &#160; % 50 % 51 % Firm-fixed-price 38 &#160; % 37 % 36 % Time-and-materials and fixed-price-level-of-effort 12 &#160; % 13 % 13 % Total 100 &#160; % 100 % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nOverview of Liquidity \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, we had $516 million in cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, we have an unsecured revolving credit facility which can provide up to $750 million in additional borrowing, if required. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities. \n\nAt December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had outstanding debt of $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. On May 6, 2022, we entered into a Term Loan Agreement which provided for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $380 million. \n\nWe have a commercial paper program in which we may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes not to \n\nexceed $750 million and have maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance (see \"Note 13&#8212;Debt\"). As of December 30, 2022, we did not have any commercial paper notes outstanding. \n\nWe made principal payments on our debt of $545 million, $106 million and $731 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This activity included required principal payments on our term loans of $476 million, $96 million and $72 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2020, we made $4,925 million of principal repayments for outstanding debt and retired the $450 million senior notes. The notes outstanding as of December 30, 2022, contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 30, 2022. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 49 \n\nPART II \n\nInterest on our Credit Facilities is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). On July 27, 2017, the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority announced that LIBOR would be discontinued or become unavailable as a reference rate by the end of 2021 and LIBOR will be fully discontinued or become unavailable as a benchmark rate by June 2023. In December 2022, the FASB issued guidance which provides relief for entities with such LIBOR denominated credit instruments so that entities may continue to account for contract modifications as a continuation of the existing contract and the continuation of the hedge accounting arrangement through December 31, 2024. \n\nAlthough our Credit Facilities include mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate for use in place of LIBOR, no assurance can be made that such alternative benchmark rate will perform in a manner similar to LIBOR or result in interest rates that are at least as favorable to us as those that would have resulted had LIBOR remained in effect, which could result in an increase in our interest expense and other debt service obligations. In addition, the overall credit market may be disrupted as a result of the replacement of LIBOR or in the anticipation thereof, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to refinance, reprice, or amend our existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness on favorable terms. \n\nWe paid dividends of $199 million, $199 million and $196 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we sold $209 million of accounts receivable under accounts receivable purchase agreements and received proceeds of $209 million (see \"Note 6&#8212;Receivables\"). There were no sales of accounts receivable in the second half of fiscal 2022. \n\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. \n\nStock repurchases of Leidos common stock may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") agreements. Whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price, corporate capital requirements, other market conditions and regulatory requirements. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. \n\nDuring fiscal 2021 and 2020, we made open market repurchases of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $237 million and $67 million, respectively. There were no open market share repurchases in fiscal 2022. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, we entered into an ASR with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock. We paid $500 million to the financial institution and received 4.8 million shares (see \"Note 16&#8212;Earnings Per Share\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K). All shares delivered were immediately retired. \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we made a $25 million payment in connection with the adverse arbitration ruling related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&#38;GS Business from Lockheed Martin. \n\nBeginning in 2022, a provision in the TCJA which eliminated the option to currently deduct research and development costs for tax purposes and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize the costs over five years became effective. We anticipate our tax cash payments to increase by $300 million in 2023 primarily to cover both the 2022 and 2023 tax obligations related to this provision. The actual impact will depend on the amount of research and development costs the Company will incur during fiscal 2023 and whether new guidance and interpretive rules are issued by the U.S. Treasury, among other factors. We will continue to assess our liquidity needs as the tax legislation and pandemic evolve. \n\nFor the next 12 months, we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances, sales of accounts receivable and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 50 \n\nPART II \n\nSummary of Cash Flows \n\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented: ##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended &#160; December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 986 &#160; $ 1,031 Net cash used in investing activities (313) (730) Net cash used in financing activities (865) (113) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (192) $ 188 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $45 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a $25 million payment in connection with the adverse arbitration ruling related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&#38;GS Business from Lockheed Martin and $23 million of payments for other legal and tax settlements occurred during the current year, partially offset by favorable working capital changes. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $417 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to $430 million of less cash paid related to our business acquisitions in current year as compared to prior year and $15 million of proceeds received from the sale of Aviation &#38; Missile Solutions LLC in the current year. The decrease was partially offset by $25 million of higher capital expenditures in the current year. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $752 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to $439 million increase in principal payments of our debt, an increase of $272 million in stock repurchases primarily attributable to the accelerated share repurchase agreement and a $45 million decrease in net capital contributions received from our non-controlling interest. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds. We also have future lease commitments for the use of certain aircraft as described in \"Note 21&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur future contractual obligations are related to debt, finance and operating leases, long-term liabilities under deferred compensation arrangements, purchase obligations for long-term purchases and service agreements and other liabilities. For more information, see \"Note 10&#8212;Leases\", \"Note 13&#8212;Debt\", &#8220;Note 19&#8212;Retirement Plans&#8221; and \"Note 21&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nWe have interest payments related to our outstanding debt and finance leases. As of December 30, 2022, future scheduled interest payments on our outstanding debt and finance leases were $195 million, expected to be paid in fiscal 2023 and $946 million expected to be paid thereafter. \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, future payments on our deferred compensation arrangements and purchase obligations for long-term purchases and service agreements were $36 million, expected to be paid in fiscal 2023, and $120 million expected to be paid thereafter. Our future payments do not include $92 million of income tax liabilities as a result of uncertain tax positions arising from certain provisions of the TCJA becoming effective in 2022, and the timing of such payments, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see \"Note 18&#8212;Income Taxes\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

For a discussion of these items, see \"Note 10&#8212;Leases\" and \"Note 21&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. \n\nWe have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. \n\n&#8226; Revenue Recognition \n\n&#8226; Goodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe perform work under various types of contracts, which include firm-fixed-price (\"FFP\"), time-and-materials (\"T&#38;M\"), fixed-price-level-of-effort (\"FP-LOE\"), cost-plus-fixed-fee (\"CPFF\"), cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee and fixed-price-incentive-fee contracts. Some of these contracts require us to use estimates of the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services for the purposes of recognizing revenue. \n\nWe also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, including the task orders issued under an IDIQ award. In addition, we assess contract modifications to determine whether changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract. Some of our cost-plus and fixed-price contracts contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the most probable amount that we expect to be entitled to, based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria, complexity of work and related risks, extent of customer discretion, amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 53 \n\nPART II \n\nOn FFP contracts requiring system integration and cost-plus contracts with variable consideration, revenue is recognized over time generally using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation, principally using a cost-input method (referred to as the cost-to-cost method). Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costs-at-completion (\"EAC\"). A performance obligation's EAC includes all direct costs such as materials, labor, subcontract costs, overhead and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs. In addition, an EAC of a performance obligation includes future losses estimated to be incurred on onerous contracts, as and when known. \n\nFor the impacts of changes in estimates on our contracts, (see \"Note 3&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"). \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. \n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested annually, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, for impairment at the reporting unit level and may be tested more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. \n\nGoodwill and intangible assets, net, collectively represent 59% and 60% of our total assets as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nWe may perform qualitative or quantitative analysis to test for impairment. Qualitative factors may include macroeconomic, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, industry, legal and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. \n\nFor quantitative analysis, we use discounted cash flow models and market multiple analyses in order to estimate reporting unit fair values. Discounted cash flow analyses rely on significant judgement and assumptions about expected future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, discount rates, expected long-term growth rates and operating margins. These assumptions are based on estimates of future sales and earnings after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Market multiple analyses incorporate significant judgments and assumptions related to the selection of guideline public companies, our forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;), forecast EBITDA of guideline public companies and control premium estimates. \n\nWe performed our annual test for impairment as of October 1, 2022, which resulted in no impairments being identified. However, through this analysis we determined that our Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit within the Civil reportable segment, which holds goodwill in the amount of $899 million as of December 30, 2022, was at risk of future impairment. The estimated fair value of the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 13%. Operations of the reporting unit rely heavily on the sales and servicing of security and detection products, which have been negatively impacted by COVID-19. The forecasts utilized to estimate the fair value of the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit assume continued global operations in all of our existing markets and a gradual improvement in the global aviation security product and related service sales, reaching pre-COVID-19 levels by fiscal 2025. The fair value of the reporting unit is also negatively impacted by rising interest rate factored into cost of capital. In the event that there are significant unfavorable changes to the forecasted cash flows of the reporting unit (including if the impact of COVID-19 on passenger travel levels is more prolonged or severe than what is incorporated into our forecast), terminal growth rates or the cost of capital used in the fair value estimates, we may be required to record a material impairment of goodwill or intangible assets at a future date. \n\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements \n\nFor a discussion of these items, see \"Note 2&#8212;Accounting Standards\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 54 \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nWe are exposed to certain market risks in the normal course of business. Our current market risk exposures are primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The following information about our market sensitive financial instruments contains forward-looking statements. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to long-term debt obligations and derivatives. Our policy authorizes, with Board of Directors' approval, the limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific interest rate risks. \n\nDebt and derivatives \n\nAt December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, of debt, which included $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, related to our senior unsecured term loans that have a variable stated interest rate that is determined based on either the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or the Stated Overnight Financing Date (\"SOFR\") rate plus a margin. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in interest expense. \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, we hold $500 million of unsecured notes due May 2023. We anticipate refinancing this obligation during fiscal 2023, at which time we will be subject to current market rates which may vary significantly from the existing rates on our debt. \n\nWe have interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of a portion of our variable rate senior unsecured term loan (\"Variable Rate Loan\"). Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we receive variable interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR rate and pay interest at a fixed rate. As of December 30, 2022, the notional value of the interest rate swap agreements was $1.0 billion. The interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our variable rate borrowing to a fixed rate borrowing. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements with respect to our Variable Rate Loan was an asset of $20 million, as of December 30, 2022, and a liability of $53 million, as of December 31, 2021. \n\nThe counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We cannot predict future market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our interest rate swaps. The net hypothetical 10% movement in the one-month LIBOR or SOFR rate would not have a significant impact on our annual interest expense. For additional information related to our interest rate swap agreements and debt, see \"Note 12&#8212;Derivative Instruments\" and \"Note 13&#8212;Debt,\" respectively, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nAs of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents included investments in several large institutional money market accounts. For fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, a hypothetical 10% interest rate movement would not have a significant impact on the value of our holdings or on interest income. \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\nAlthough the majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our (or one of our subsidiaries') functional currency. Our foreign operations represented 8% of total revenues for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 55 \n\n"

The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements with respect to our Variable Rate Loan was an asset of $20 million, as of December 30, 2022, and a liability of $53 million, as of December 31, 2021. \n\nThe counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We cannot predict future market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our interest rate swaps. The net hypothetical 10% movement in the one-month LIBOR or SOFR rate would not have a significant impact on our annual interest expense. For additional information related to our interest rate swap agreements and debt, see \"Note 12&#8212;Derivative Instruments\" and \"Note 13&#8212;Debt,\" respectively, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nAs of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents included investments in several large institutional money market accounts. For fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, a hypothetical 10% interest rate movement would not have a significant impact on the value of our holdings or on interest income. \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\nAlthough the majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our (or one of our subsidiaries') functional currency. Our foreign operations represented 8% of total revenues for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 55 \n\nPART II \n\n"

Annual Report - 56 \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Leidos Holdings, Inc. \n\nReston, Virginia \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Leidos Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2022, December 31, 2021, and January 1, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2022, December 31, 2021, and January 1, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013 ) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 57 \n\nGoodwill Valuation &#8211; Security Enterprise Solutions Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 3 and Note 8 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company performed a quantitative impairment evaluation of the goodwill for the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires the exercise of significant judgment and assumptions including judgments about expected future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, discount rates and expected long-term growth rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting unit, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The goodwill balance was $6,696 million as of December 30, 2022 of which $899 million related to the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit. The Company&#8217;s accounting policy is to test for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As a result of the quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by $174 million, or 13%, which resulted in no impairment for the year ended December 30, 2022. \n\nWe identified goodwill for the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and the difference between its fair value and carrying value. Performing audit procedures to develop an independent estimate of the fair value of the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit, which included evaluating estimates and assumptions related to the cost of capital, forecasts of future cash flows, and terminal growth rates due to the sensitivity of the operations to changes in global aviation security products and related services markets, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the selection of the discount rate, terminal growth rate and forecasts of future revenues and cash flows for the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of controls over management&#8217;s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the selection of the discount rate, terminal growth rate and management&#8217;s development of forecasted revenues and cash flows. \n\n&#8226; We developed an independent estimate of the fair value of the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit using the income approach. We utilized historical results of the reporting unit and inspected third-party industry reports for the global aviation security products and related services markets to develop projections. Additionally, we developed the discount rate and terminal year growth rate with the assistance of our fair value specialists. \n\n&#8226; We developed an independent estimate of the fair value of the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit using the market approach. We selected guideline peer companies and developed enterprise value multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. \n\n&#8226; We calculated our independent expectation of the fair value of the reporting unit by weighting the results of the market and income approaches and compared the resulting fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. \n\nRevenues &#8212; Refer to Note 3 and Note 4 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue on service-based contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the Company performs the promised services. The accounting conclusions for contracts involves judgment, particularly as it relates to determining whether multiple promises within a single contract are highly interrelated and represent a single performance obligation and whether the Company is acting as a principal in the fulfillment of the identified performance obligations on certain contracts. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 58 \n\nOn firm-fixed-price ('FFP\") contracts requiring system integration and cost-plus contracts with variable consideration, revenue is recognized over time generally using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation, principally using a cost-input method (referred to as the cost-to-cost method). Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costs-at-completion (\"EAC\"). A performance obligation's EAC includes all direct costs such as materials, labor, subcontract costs, overhead and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs. The accounting for these contracts involves judgment, particularly as it relates to the process of estimating total costs for the performance obligation. \n\nGiven the judgments necessary to determine whether multiple promises within a single contract represent a single performance obligation, whether or not the Company is acting as principal in the fulfillment of the identified performance obligations on certain contracts, and estimates of total costs for the performance obligations that recognize revenue using the cost-to-cost method, auditing such accounting conclusions and estimates required extensive audit effort due to the volume and complexity of these contracts and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to management&#8217;s conclusions regarding whether multiple promises within a single contract represent a single performance obligation, whether or not the Company is acting as a principal or an agent in fulfilling identified performance obligations on certain contracts, and estimates of total costs for the performance obligations that recognize revenue using the cost-to-cost method included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of controls over contract revenue, including management&#8217;s controls over the initial setup of new contract arrangements and the estimates of total costs and revenues for identified performance obligations. \n\n&#8226; We tested recorded revenue using a combination of analytical procedures and detailed contract testing. \n\n&#8226; For a selection of contracts, we performed the following for each contract: \n\n&#9702; Evaluated the terms and conditions of each contract and the appropriateness of the accounting treatment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, by: \n\n&#9642; Inspecting the executed contract to verify that the facts on which management&#8217;s conclusions were reached were consistent with the actual terms and conditions of the contract. \n\n&#9642; Evaluating the contract within the context of the five-step model prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that management&#8217;s conclusions were appropriate by evaluating the nature of the promises within the contract, the interrelationship of the promised services provided, the pattern by which obligations are fulfilled, the number of performance obligations identified, and which party is acting as principal in the fulfillment of the identified performance obligations. \n\n&#9702; Tested the mathematical accuracy of management&#8217;s calculation of revenue for the performance obligation. \n\n&#8226; We analyzed cumulative adjustments recorded during the year and tested those with characteristics of audit interest to determine that the adjustments were the result of changes in facts and circumstances and not estimates that were previously inaccurate. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nMcLean, Virginia \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since fiscal 2000. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

Annual Report - 65 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNote 1&#8212;Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation \n\nNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. (\"Leidos\"), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company whose direct 100%-owned subsidiary and principal operating company is Leidos, Inc. Leidos is a FORTUNE 500 &#174; technology, engineering, and science company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets, both domestically and internationally. Leidos' customers include the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and many other U.S. civilian, state and local government agencies, foreign government agencies and commercial businesses. Unless indicated otherwise, references to \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer collectively to Leidos Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We operate in three reportable segments: Defense Solutions, Civil and Health. Additionally, we separately present the unallocable costs associated with corporate functions as Corporate. \n\nWe have an 88 % controlling interest in Mission Support Alliance, LLC (\"MSA\"), a joint venture with Centerra Group, LLC, which includes 41 % purchased from Jacobs Group, LLC on January 26, 2018. MSA&#8217;s contract ended on January 24, 2021. We also have a 53 % controlling interest in Hanford Mission Integration Solutions, LLC (\"HMIS\"), the legal entity for the follow-on contract to MSA's contract and a joint venture with Centerra Group, LLC and Parsons Government Services, Inc. We consolidate the financial results for MSA and HMIS into our consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe consolidated financial statements also include the balances of all voting interest entities in which Leidos has a controlling voting interest (\"subsidiaries\") and a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") in which Leidos is the primary beneficiary. The consolidated balances of the VIE are not material to the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated companies have been eliminated in consolidation. \n\nEffective July 3, 2021, certain contracts were reassigned from the Defense Solutions reportable segment to the Civil reportable segment. Impact on prior year segment results were determined to be immaterial and have not been recast to reflect this change. \n\nCertain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. We combined \"Capital distributions to non-controlling interests\" and \"Capital contributions from non-controlling interests\" into \"Net capital (distributions to) contributions from non-controlling interests\", \"Collections on promissory notes\" and \"Bad debt expense and recoveries\" into \"Other\" on the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 66 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNote 2&#8212;Accounting Standards \n\nAccounting Standards Updates Adopted \n\nASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, which amends how contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured. Current guidance requires contract assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The amendments in this Update remove the requirement to measure contract assets and liabilities at fair value and instead require that they be recognized in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. \n\nWe adopted the requirements of ASU 2021-08 using the prospective method effective the first day of fiscal 2022. For business combinations occurring after adoption, we measured contract assets and liabilities acquired in accordance ASC 606. \n\nAccounting Standards Updates Issued But Not Yet Adopted \n\nASU 2020-04, ASU 2021-01, and ASU 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides companies with optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. This update provides optional expedients for applying accounting guidance to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities as of March 2020 and can be adopted using a prospective approach no later than December 31, 2022. \n\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 which amends the scope of ASU 2020-04. The amendments in this \n\nupdate are elective and provide optional relief for entities with hedge accounting and contract modifications affected \n\nby the discounting transition through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 which extends the deadline for application of ASU 2021-01 through December 31, 2024. Under this relief, entities may continue to account for contract modifications as a continuation of the existing contract and the continuation of the hedge accounting arrangement. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the reference rate reform. Except for our new $ 380 million term loan entered into on May 6, 2022 (see \"Note 13&#8212;Debt\"), we currently use the one-month LIBOR for which the rate publication will cease in June 2023. \n\nNote 3&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nReporting Periods \n\nLeidos' fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest the end of December. Fiscal 2022 ended December 30, 2022. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 each included 52 weeks. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including those relating to estimated profitability of long-term contracts, indirect billing rates, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventories, right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities, fair value and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, pension benefits, stock-based compensation expense and contingencies. These estimates have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. \n\nOperating Cycle \n\nOur operating cycle for long-term contracts may be greater than one year and is measured by the average time intervening between the inception and the completion of those contracts. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 67 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nBusiness Combinations, Investments and Variable Interest Entities \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nThe accounting for business combinations requires management to make judgments and estimates related to the fair value of assets acquired, including the identification and valuation of intangible assets, as well as liabilities and contingencies assumed. Such judgments and estimates directly impact the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with an acquisition. Estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangibles, requires judgments about expected future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, discount rates and expected long-term growth rates. \n\nInvestments \n\nInvestments in entities and corporate joint ventures where we have a non-controlling ownership interest but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We recognize our proportionate share of the entities' net income or loss and do not consolidate the entities' assets and liabilities. \n\nEquity investments in entities over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence and whose securities do not have a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost or cost net of other-than-temporary impairments. \n\nVariable Interest Entities \n\nWe occasionally form joint ventures and/or enter into arrangements with special purpose limited liability companies for the purpose of bidding and executing on specific projects. We analyze each such arrangement to determine whether it represents a VIE. If the arrangement is determined to be a VIE, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and are consequently required to consolidate the VIE. \n\nDivestitures \n\nFrom time-to-time, we may dispose (or management may commit to plans to dispose) of strategic or non-strategic components of the business. Divestitures representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect in operations and financial results are classified as discontinued operations, whereas non-strategic divestitures remain in continuing operations. \n\nRestructuring Expenses \n\nRestructuring expenses are incurred in connection with programs aimed at reducing our costs. Restructuring costs may include one-time termination of benefits, costs to terminate contracts and other permanent exit costs to consolidate or close facilities directly related to the restructuring program. \n\nOne-time involuntary termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the plan of termination has been communicated to employees and certain other criteria are met. Ongoing termination benefit arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when it is probable that amounts will be paid and such amounts are reasonably estimable. Costs associated with exit or disposal activities, including the related one-time and ongoing involuntary termination benefits, are included as \"Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs\" on the consolidated statements of income. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nOur revenues from contracts with customers are from offerings including digital modernization, cyber operations, mission software systems, integrated systems and mission operations, primarily with the U.S. government and its agencies. We also serve various state and local governments, foreign governments and commercial customers. \n\nWe perform under various types of contracts, which include firm-fixed-price (\"FFP\"), time-and-materials (\"T&#38;M\"), fixed-price-level-of-effort (\"FP-LOE\"), cost-plus-fixed-fee (\"CPFF\"), cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee and fixed-price-incentive-fee (\"FP-IF\") contracts. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 68 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nTo determine the proper revenue recognition, we first evaluate whether we have a duly approved and enforceable contract with a customer, in which the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified, and collectability is probable. We also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, including the task orders issued under an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (\"IDIQ\") award. In addition, we assess contract modifications to determine whether changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract. Contract modifications generally relate to changes in contract specifications and requirements and do not add distinct services, and therefore are accounted for as part of the original contract. If contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by an amount that reflects the standalone selling price, those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts. \n\nMost of our contracts are comprised of multiple promises including the design and build of software-based systems, integration of hardware and software solutions, running and maintaining of IT infrastructure and procurement services. In all cases, we assess if the multiple promises should be accounted for as separate performance obligations or combined into a single performance obligation. We generally separate multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct, both individually and in the context of the contract. If multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or require significant integration or customization within a group, they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation. \n\nOur contracts with the U.S. government often contain options to renew existing contracts for an additional period of time (generally a year at a time) under the same terms and conditions as the original contract, and generally do not provide the customer any material rights under the contract. We account for renewal options as separate contracts when they include distinct goods or services at standalone selling prices. \n\nContracts with the U.S. government are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\"FAR\") and priced on estimated or actual costs of providing the goods or services. The FAR provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the U.S. government and its agencies. Each contract is competitively priced and bid separately. Pricing for non-U.S. government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer. In circumstances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price using the expected cost-plus margin approach. Any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price are excluded. \n\nCertain cost-plus and fixed-price contracts contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the most probable amount that we expect to be entitled to, based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria, complexity of work and related risks, extent of customer discretion, amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue. \n\nWe allocate the transaction price of a contract to its performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price of the performance obligations is generally based on an expected cost-plus margin approach, in accordance with the FAR. For certain product sales, prices from other standalone sales are used. Substantially all of our contracts do not contain a significant financing component, which would require an adjustment to the transaction price of the contract. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 69 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nWe recognize revenue on our service-based contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the promised services are performed. For U.S. government contracts, continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work-in-process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work-in-process as evidenced by rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services for which we do not have an alternate use. Anticipated losses on service-based contracts are recognized when incurred (generally on a straight-line basis) over the contract term. In certain product sales, where the products have an alternate use, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer takes control of the asset usually denoted by possession, transfer of legal title and acceptance by the customer. \n\nOn FFP contracts requiring system integration and cost-plus contracts with variable consideration, revenue is recognized over time generally using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation, principally using a cost-input method (referred to as the cost-to-cost method). Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costs-at-completion (\"EAC\"). A performance obligation's EAC includes all direct costs such as materials, labor, subcontract costs, overhead and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs. In addition, an EAC of a performance obligation includes future losses estimated to be incurred on onerous contracts, as and when known. On certain other contracts, principally T&#38;M, FP-LOE and CPFF, revenue is generally recognized using the right-to-invoice practical expedient as we are contractually able to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer. Additionally, on maintenance (generally FFP) performance obligations, revenue is recognized over time using a straight-line method as the control of the services is provided to the customer evenly over the period of performance. \n\nFor certain performance obligations where we are not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or service to the customer, do not have inventory risk and do not have discretion in establishing the price for the goods or service, we recognize revenue on a net basis. \n\nContract Costs \n\nContract costs generally include direct costs such as labor, materials, subcontract costs and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to a specific contract. Costs are expensed as incurred unless they qualify for deferral and capitalization. Contract costs incurred for U.S. government contracts, including indirect costs, are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\") (see \"Note 21&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies\"). \n\nPre-contract Costs \n\nCosts incurred on projects as pre-contract costs are deferred as assets when we have been requested by the customer to begin work under a new arrangement prior to contract execution and it is probable that we will recover the costs through the issuance of a contract. Pre-contract costs are amortized over the contract period of performance or a specified period of performance. \n\nTransition Costs \n\nUnder certain service contracts, costs are incurred, usually at the beginning of the contract performance, to transition the services, employees and equipment to or from the customer, a prior contract or prior contractor. These costs are generally capitalized as deferred assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated term of the contract or a specified period of performance, including unexercised option periods that are reasonably certain of being exercised. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 70 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nProject Assets \n\nPurchases of project assets are capitalized for specific contracts where we maintain ownership of the asset over the life of the contract and the benefit is received over a period of time. Project assets include enterprise software licenses, dedicated hardware, maintenance agreements and significant material purchases and other costs incurred on contracts. Project assets are amortized from the balance sheet using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or over the expected term of the period of performance, whichever is shorter. \n\nChanges in Estimates on Contracts \n\nChanges in estimates related to contracts accounted for using the cost-to-cost method of accounting are recognized in the period in which such changes are made for the inception-to-date effect of the changes, with the exception of contracts acquired through a business combination, where the adjustment is made for the period commencing from the date of acquisition. \n\nChanges in estimates on contracts for the periods presented were as follows: ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 January 1, 2021 (in millions, except for per share amounts) Favorable impact \n\n$ 146 &#160; $ 149 &#160; $ 137 &#160; Unfavorable impact \n\n( 113 ) ( 102 ) ( 61 ) Net favorable impact to income before income taxes \n\n$ 33 &#160; $ 47 &#160; $ 76 &#160; Impact on diluted EPS attributable to Leidos common stockholders \n\n$ 0.17 &#160; $ 0.25 &#160; $ 0.39 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe impact on diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") attributable to Leidos common stockholders is calculated using our statutory tax rate. \n\nRevenue Recognized from Prior Obligations \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was $ 9 million, $ 26 million and $ 40 million, respectively. The changes primarily relate to revisions of variable consideration, including award and incentive fees, and revisions to estimates at completion resulting from changes in contract scope, mitigation of contract risks or due to true-ups of contract estimates at the end of contract performance. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nWe classify indirect costs incurred within or allocated to our U.S. government customers as overhead (included in \"Cost of revenues\") or general and administrative expenses in the same manner as such costs are defined in our disclosure statements under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include general and administrative, bid and proposal, company-funded research and development expenses, and legal fees and settlements. \n\nWe conduct research and development activities under customer-funded contracts and with company-funded research and development funds. Company-funded research and development expense was $ 116 million, $ 109 million and $ 73 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Expenses for research and development activities performed under customer contracts are charged directly to cost of revenues for those contracts. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with the accounting standard for income taxes. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Under this method, changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 71 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes. \n\nThe provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. \n\nWe record liabilities for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our income tax expense. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nOur cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in several large institutional money market accounts, with original maturity of three months or less. Outstanding payments are included within \"Cash and cash equivalents\" and \"Accounts payable and accrued liabilities\" correspondingly on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, $ 158 million and $ 138 million, respectively, of outstanding payments were included within \"Cash and cash equivalents.\" \n\nRestricted Cash \n\nWe have restricted cash balances, primarily representing advances from customers that are restricted as to use for certain expenditures related to that customer's contract. Restricted cash balances are included as \"Other current assets\" on the consolidated balance sheets. Our restricted cash balances were $ 167 million and $ 148 million at December 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nReceivables \n\nReceivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts billable where the right to consideration is unconditional and amounts unbilled. Amounts billable and unbilled amounts are recognized at estimated realizable value and consist of costs and fees, substantially all of which are expected to be billed and collected generally within one year. Unbilled amounts also include rate variances that are billable upon negotiation of final indirect rates with the Defense Contract Management Agency. \n\nCost-reimbursable and T&#38;M contracts are generally billed as costs are incurred. FFP contracts are billed either based on milestones, which are the achievement of specific events as defined in the contract, or based on progress payments, which are interim payments up to a designated amount of costs incurred as work progresses. On certain contracts, the customer withholds a certain percentage of the contract price (retainage). These withheld amounts are included within unbilled receivables and are billed upon contract completion or the occurrence of a specified event, and when negotiation of final indirect rates with the U.S. government is complete. Based on our historical experience, the write-offs of retention balances have not been significant. \n\nWhen events or conditions indicate that amounts outstanding from customers may become uncollectible, an allowance is estimated and recorded. \n\nAmounts billed and collected on contracts but not yet recorded as revenue because we have not performed our obligation under the arrangement with a customer are deferred and included within \"Accounts payable and accrued liabilities\" or \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 72 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nConcentration of Credit Risk \n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of accounts receivable and derivatives. Since our receivables are primarily with the U.S. government, we do not have exposure to a material credit risk. We manage our credit risk related to derivatives through the use of multiple counterparties with high credit standards. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Generally, raw material inventory is valued using the average cost method. Work-in-process inventory may include material costs, labor and allocable overhead costs. The majority of finished goods inventory consists of technology and security products, inspection systems, baggage scanning equipment and small glide munitions. Inventory is evaluated against historical or planned usage to determine appropriate provisions for obsolete inventory. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level and tested more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may not be recoverable. Our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. During both fiscal 2022 and 2021, we had seven reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment. \n\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment either under a qualitative assessment option or a quantitative approach, which depends on the facts and circumstances of a reporting unit, consideration of the excess of a reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount in previous assessments and changes in business environment. \n\nWhen performing a qualitative assessment, we consider factors including, but not limited to, current macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance and other events relevant to the entity or reporting unit under evaluation to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. \n\nWhen performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the reporting unit carrying value is compared to its fair value. Goodwill is deemed impaired if, and the impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which, the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value. \n\nWe estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using Level 3 inputs when a quantitative analysis is performed. These analyses rely on significant judgements and assumptions about expected future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, discount rates, expected long-term growth rates, operating margins and on the selection of guideline public companies. \n\nIntangible Assets \n\nAcquired intangible assets with finite lives and internally developed software are amortized using the method that best reflects how their economic benefits are utilized or, if a pattern of economic benefits cannot be reliably determined, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Program intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives in proportion to the pattern of economic benefit based on expected future discounted cash flows. Backlog and trade name intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Customer relationships and software and technology intangible assets are amortized either on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or over their respective estimated useful lives in proportion to the pattern of economic benefit based on expected future discounted cash flows, as deemed appropriate. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 73 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the following periods: ##TABLE_START &#160; Estimated useful lives (in years) Backlog 1 \n\nCustomer relationships 8 - 10 \n\nPrograms 4 - 13 \n\nSoftware and technology 3 - 15 \n\nTrade names 3 ##TABLE_END \n\nIntangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. \n\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment, including purchases of software and software licenses, as well as costs associated with major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals and improvements are expensed as incurred. \n\nConstruction in Progress (\"CIP\") is used to accumulate all costs for projects that are not yet complete. CIP balances are transferred to the appropriate asset account when the asset is capitalized and ready for its intended use. \n\nWhen assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation is recognized using the methods and estimated useful lives as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; Depreciation method Estimated useful lives (in years) Computers and other equipment Straight-line or declining-balance 2 - 15 \n\nBuildings Straight-line Not to exceed 40 \n\nBuilding improvements and leasehold improvements \n\nStraight-line Shorter of useful life of asset or remaining lease term Vehicles and transportation equipment Straight-line 2 - 15 \n\nOffice furniture and fixtures Straight-line or declining-balance 6 - 9 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. \n\nLeases \n\nLessee \n\nWe have facilities and equipment lease arrangements. An arrangement is determined to be a lease at inception if it conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets represent the right to use an underlying asset over the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. \n\nROU assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. We generally do not know the discount rate implicit in our leases; therefore, the discount rate used is our incremental borrowing rate which is determined based on the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. An ROU asset is initially measured by the present value of the remaining lease payments, plus initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments, less any lease incentives received before commencement. The remaining lease cost is allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis unless another systematic or rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which the underlying asset is expected to be used. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 74 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nCertain facility leases contain options to renew or extend the terms of the lease which are included in the determination of the ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Leases may also include variable lease payments such as an escalation clause based on consumer price index rates, maintenance costs and utilities. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the determination of ROU assets and lease liabilities using the index or rate at the lease commencement date, whereas variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are recorded as lease expense in the period incurred. At December 30, 2022, certain of the Company's equipment leases includ e residual value guarantees. \n\nWe use the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead account for both components as a single lease. The practical expedient is applied to all material classes of leased assets except for aircraft, for which we account for the lease component and non-lease component separately. \n\nThe related lease payments on short-term facilities and equipment leases are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nROU assets are evaluated for impairment in a manner consistent with the treatment of other long-lived assets. ROU assets are assessed for potential impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. This includes an establishment of a plan of abandonment, which occurs when we have committed to a plan to abandon the lease before the end of its previously estimated useful life and there is no expectation that we will re-enter or re-purpose the space. \n\nLessor \n\nWe are a lessor on certain equipment sales-type and operating lease arrangements with our customers. To be considered lease revenue, the contract must contain a specified asset, we must not have a substantive substitution right, the customer must have the right to direct the use of the specified asset during the period of use and the customer must have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit of the specified asset. \n\nCertain arrangements may contain variable payments that depend on an index or rate and are measured using the index or rate on the commencement date. Variable payments that are not included in the net investments are recorded as revenue as incurred. Arrangements may also contain options to renew or extend the performance period. Option periods are included in the lease term if we determine that it is reasonably certain the customer will exercise an option. \n\nWe have arrangements that contain both lease and non-lease components. We account for them as one unit of account if the timing and pattern of transfer is identical for both the lease and the non-lease components and the lease component would be classified as an operating lease if accounted for separately. If both criteria are met and the predominant component is a lease, then the entire arrangement will be accounted for in accordance with ASC 842. If we account for an arrangement both as a lease and non-lease component, then the allocation of consideration for each component will be based on the relative standalone sales price. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe accounting standard for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets (Level 1); inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly or quoted prices that are not active (Level 2); and unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data (e.g., discounted cash flow and other similar pricing models), which requires us to develop our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (Level 3). \n\nThe accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made fair value option elections on any of our financial assets and liabilities. \n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is determined based on quoted market prices, if available, or management's best estimate (see \"Financial Instruments\" below). \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 75 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nManagement evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment at each balance sheet date. When testing long-term investments for recovery of carrying value, the fair value of long-term investments is determined using various valuation techniques and factors, such as market prices of comparable companies (Level 2 input), discounted cash flow models (Level 3 input). If management determines that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of an investment has occurred, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the investment to its estimated fair value. \n\nOur non-financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets. The valuation methods used to determine fair value require a significant degree of management judgment to determine the key assumptions. As such, we generally classify non-financial instruments as either Level 2 or Level 3 fair value measurements. \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nWe are exposed to certain market risks which are inherent in certain transactions entered into during the normal course of business. These transactions include sales or purchase contracts denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to changing interest rates. We manage our risk to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative instruments. \n\nFor fixed rate borrowings, we use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. The fair value of these interest rate swaps is determined based on observed values for underlying interest rates on the LIBOR yield curve (Level 2). \n\nFor variable rate borrowings, we use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting a portion of the variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these interest rate swaps is determined based on observed values for the underlying interest rates (Level 2). \n\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges and hedge accounting does not apply. We do not hold derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. \n\nOur defined benefit plan assets consist of investments in pooled funds that contain investments with values based on quoted market prices, but for which the pools are not valued on a daily quoted market basis (Level 2). \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nWe account for stock-based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. \n\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards and performance-based stock awards is based on the closing price of Leidos common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of performance-based stock awards with market conditions is based on using a Monte Carlo simulation. \n\nThe fair value of stock option awards granted is based on using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The estimation of stock option fair value requires management to make estimates and judgments about, among other things, employee exercise behavior, forfeiture rates and the expected volatility of Leidos common stock over the expected option term. These judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized. \n\nForeign Currency \n\nThe financial statements of consolidated international subsidiaries, for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted average exchange rate over the reporting period for revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. Gains and losses due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates are recognized as \"Other expense, net\" on the consolidated statements of income. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 76 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNote 4&#8212;Revenues \n\nRemaining Performance Obligations \n\nRemaining performance obligations (\"RPO\") represent the expected value of exercised contracts, both funded and unfunded, less revenue recognized to date. RPO does not include unexercised option periods and future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ contracts, General Services Administration Schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles, with the exception of certain IDIQ contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded and separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism, and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future anticipated task orders. \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, we had $ 15.4 billion of RPO and expect to recognize approximately 57 % and 74 % over the next 12 months and 24 months, respectively, with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. \n\nDisaggregation of Revenues \n\nWe disaggregate revenues by customer-type, contract-type and geographic location for each of our reportable segments.

Failure to comply with U.S. government laws and regulations applicable to international business, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. export control regulations, could have an adverse impact on our business with the U.S. government. \n\nIn some countries, there is an increased chance for economic, legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services, sales of products or repatriation of profits. International transactions can also involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange variability, imposition of tariffs or additional taxes and restrictive trade policies and delays or failure to collect amounts due to differing legal systems. \n\nRevenues by contract-type, customer-type and geographic location exclude lease income of $ 109 million, $ 120 million and $ 100 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively (see \"Note 10&#8212;Leases\"). \n\nContract Assets and Liabilities \n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied either over time as work progresses or at a point in time. Firm-fixed-price contracts are typically billed to the customer using milestone payments while cost-reimbursable and time and materials contracts are typically billed to the customer on a monthly or bi-weekly basis as indicated by the negotiated billing terms and conditions of the contract. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition, customer billings and cash collections for each contract results in a net contract asset or liability at the end of each reporting period. \n\nContract assets consist of unbilled receivables, which is the amount of revenue recognized that exceeds the amount billed to the customer, where right to payment is not solely subject to the passage of time. Unbilled receivables exclude amounts billable where the right to consideration is unconditional. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue, which represents cash advances received prior to performance for programs and billings in excess of revenue recognized. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

We performed a quantitative analysis for certain reporting units and concluded that these reporting units were not impaired as their fair values exceeded their carrying values. The quantitative analysis for the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit, which holds goodwill of $ 899 million as of December 30, 2022, showed that fair value exceeded carrying value by 13 %. Operations of the reporting unit rely heavily on the sales and servicing of security and detection products, which have been negatively impacted by COVID-19. The forecasts utilized to estimate the fair value of the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit assume continued global operations in all of our existing markets and a gradual improvement in the global aviation security product and related service sales, reaching pre-COVID-19 levels by fiscal 2025. In the event that there are significant unfavorable changes to the forecasted cash flows of the reporting unit (including if the impact of COVID-19 on passenger travel levels is more prolonged or severe than what is incorporated into our forecast), terminal growth rates or the cost of capital used in the fair value estimates, we may be required to record a material impairment of goodwill or intangible assets at a future date. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we performed a qualitative analysis for certain reporting units which determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units were in excess of the individual reporting units' carrying values. For reporting units whose composition was affected by a reorganization, or those for which an indication of impairment exists, a quantitative assessment was performed. The quantitative analysis for the Security Enterprise Solutions reporting unit within the Civil reportable segment, which holds goodwill in the amount of $ 926 million as of December 31, 2021, showed that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed a qualitative analysis for all reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were in excess of the individual reporting units carrying values, and as a result, a quantitative step one analysis was not necessary. \n\nAs a result, no goodwill impairments were identified as part of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation for the periods mentioned above. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

The fair value of the cash flow interest rate swaps is determined based on observed values for underlying interest rates on the LIBOR yield curve (Level 2 inputs). \n\nFinancial instruments measured on a recurring basis at fair value also include our defined benefit plan assets (Level 2 inputs). See \"Note 19&#8212;Retirement Plans\" for further details on these investments. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 90 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments, other than derivatives, which include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are reasonable estimates of their related fair values. The carrying value of our notes receivable of $ 12 million and $ 15 million as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, approximates fair value as the stated interest rates within the agreements are consistent with the current market rates used in notes with similar terms in the market (Level 2 inputs). \n\nAs of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of debt was $ 4.6 billion and $ 5.4 billion, respectively, and the carrying amount was $ 4.9 billion and $ 5.1 billion, respectively (see \"Note 13&#8212;Debt\"). The fair value of debt is determined based on current interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to our existing debt arrangements (Level 2 inputs). \n\nOn October 30, 2022, May 7, 2021, and January 14, 2021, non-financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Cobham Special Mission, Gibbs &#38; Cox and 1901 Group, respectively. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using Level 3 inputs. See \"Note 5&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures\" for further details on these acquisitions. As of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. \n\nNote 12&#8212;Derivative Instruments \n\nThe fair value of the interest rate swaps was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Balance sheet line item December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Asset derivatives: Cash flow interest rate swaps Other long-term assets $ 20 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Liability derivatives: Cash flow interest rate swaps Other long-term liabilities $ &#8212; &#160; $ 53 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe cash flows associated with the interest rate swaps are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to offset foreign currency fluctuations of the $ 310 million Australian dollar preliminary purchase price for the Cobham Special Mission acquisition against the U.S. dollar. We realized a loss of $ 18 million resulting from the settlement of the foreign currency forward contract. The loss was recorded within Corporate and presented in \"Other expense, net\" on the consolidated statements of income and the settlement associated with the foreign currency forward contract was classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nWe have interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of $ 1.0 billion of the variable rate senior unsecured term loan (the \"Variable Rate Loan\"). These interest rate swap agreements have a maturity date of August 2025 and a fixed interest rate of 3.00 %. The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the Variable Rate Loan, which are based on the LIBOR rate. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we receive monthly variable interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR rate and pay interest at a fixed rate. \n\nThe interest rate swap transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges. The gain/loss on the swap is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into earnings when the interest payments on the underlying hedged items impact earnings. A qualitative assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed on a quarterly basis, unless facts and circumstances indicate the hedge may no longer be highly effective. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

The proceeds of the Term Loan Agreement were used to repay the $ 380 million senior unsecured term loan entered into on May 7, 2021. \n\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.10 %, or an alternate base rate at our option. \n\nThe financial covenants in the Term Loan Agreement require that we maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of adjusted consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.75 to 1.00, subject to increases to 4.50 to 1.00 following a material acquisition, and a ratio of EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.50 to 1.00. \n\nOn May 7, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with certain financial institutions, which provided for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 380 million with maturity 364 days after the credit agreement date. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of Gibbs &#38; Cox. The term loan was repaid on May 6, 2022. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 93 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nWe have a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with certain financial institutions, which provided for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 1.9 billion (the \"Term Loan Facility\") and a $ 750 million senior unsecured revolving facility (the \"Revolving Facility\" and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the \"Credit Facilities\"). The Credit Facilities are scheduled to mature in January 2025, with the Revolving Facility subject to two additional one year extensions. As of December 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. \n\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate determined, at our option, based on either an alternate base rate or a LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin that varies depending on our credit rating. The applicable margin range for LIBOR-denominated borrowings is from 1.13 % to 1.75 %. Based on our current ratings, the applicable margin for LIBOR-denominated borrowings is 1.38 %. \n\nThe financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require that we maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of adjusted consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA of not more than 3.75 to 1.00, subject to two increases to 4.50 to 1.00 following a material acquisition, and a ratio of EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.50 to 1.00. \n\nCommercial Paper \n\nOn July 12, 2021, we established a commercial paper program in which the Company may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\") not to exceed $ 750 million. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. \n\nThe Commercial Paper Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $ 0.25 million and will have maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The Commercial Paper Notes will bear either a stated or floating interest rate, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from the face amount. As of December 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we did not have any Commercial Paper Notes outstanding. \n\nPrincipal Payments and Debt Issuance Costs \n\nWe made principal payments on our debt of $ 545 million, $ 106 million and $ 731 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This activity included required principal payments on our term loans of $ 476 million, $ 96 million and $ 72 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2020, we made $ 4,925 million of principal repayments for outstanding debt and retired the $ 450 million senior notes. \n\nPrincipal payments are made quarterly on our Term Loan Facility, with the majority of the principal due at maturity. Interest on the Term Loan Facility is payable on a periodic basis, which must be at least quarterly. Principal on the Term Loan Agreement is due at maturity and interest is paid monthly. Interest on the senior fixed rate unsecured notes is payable on a semi-annual basis with principal payments due at maturity. \n\nAmortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs was $ 11 million for both fiscal 2022 and 2021, and $ 16 million for fiscal 2020. \n\nThe Credit Facilities, the Term Loan Agreement, Commercial Paper Notes, senior unsecured term loans and notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed and contain certain customary restrictive covenants, including among other things, restrictions on our ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions under certain circumstances.

The total outstanding stock options and vesting stock awards that were anti-dilutive were 1 million for both fiscal 2022 and 2021. There were no significant anti-diluted equity awards for fiscal 2020. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nDuring fiscal 2021 and 2020, we made open market repurchases of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $ 237 million and $ 67 million, respectively. There were no open market share repurchases in fiscal 2022. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, we entered into Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock. We paid $ 500 million to the financial institution and received 4.8 million shares. \n\nThe repurchases were recorded to \"Additional paid-in capital\" in the consolidated balance sheets. All shares delivered were immediately retired. \n\nNote 17&#8212;Stock-Based Compensation \n\nPlan Summaries \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, we had stock-based compensation awards outstanding under the following plans: the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and the 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (\"ESPP\"). We issue new shares upon the vesting of stock units or exercising of stock options under these plans. \n\nThe 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides Leidos and its affiliates' employees, directors and consultants the opportunity to receive various types of stock-based compensation awards, such as stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based awards, as well as cash awards. We grant service-based awards that generally vest or become exercisable 25 % a year over four years or cliff vest in three years . As of December 30, 2022, 3.5 million shares of Leidos' stock were reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. \n\nWe offer eligible employees the opportunity to defer restricted stock units into an equity-based deferred equity compensation plan, the Key Executive Stock Deferral Plan (\"KESDP\"). Prior to 2013, we offered an additional opportunity for deferrals into the Management Stock Compensation Plan (\"MSCP\"). Benefits from these plans are payable in shares of Leidos' stock that are held in a trust for the purpose of funding shares to the plans' participants. Restricted stock units deferred under the KESDP are counted against the total shares available for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan. All awards under the MSCP are fully vested and the plan does not provide for a maximum number of shares available for future issuance. \n\nOur ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Leidos' stock at a discount of up to 15 % of the fair market value on the date of purchase.

Stock options have a term of seven years and a vesting period of four years , except for stock options granted to our outside directors, which have a vesting period of the earlier of one year from grant date or the next annual meeting of stockholders following grant date. \n\nThe fair value of the stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of the stock option awards to employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of four years , except for stock options granted to our outside directors, which is recognized over the vesting period of one year or less. \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we used a blended approach to measure expected volatility that is based on our weighted average historical and implied volatilities. \n\nThe risk-free rate is derived using the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option on the grant date. To determine the expected term, we use the midpoint scenario with a one-year grant date filter assumption for outstanding options and we use historical data to estimate forfeitures.

At January 1, 2021, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits included liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $ 6 million, $ 4 million of which were classified as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&#8220;TCJA&#8221;) eliminated the option to currently deduct certain research and development costs for tax purposes and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research costs over five years. Based upon our interpretation of the law as currently enacted, we recorded the estimated fiscal 2022 impact, resulting in increases of $ 130 million to both our income taxes payable and net deferred tax assets. Our unrecognized tax benefits also increased by $ 91 million with a corresponding increase to net deferred tax assets. The actual impact will depend on the amount of research and development costs the Company will incur, whether Congress modifies or repeals this provision and whether new guidance and interpretive rules are issued by the U.S. Treasury, among other factors. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 104 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nWe file income tax returns in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. For the year ended December 30, 2022, we are participating in the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) Compliance Assurance Process (\"CAP\"), a real-time audit of our consolidated federal corporate income tax return. The IRS has examined our consolidated federal income tax returns through the year ended January 3, 2020. For the years ended January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021, we were selected to participate in the phase of CAP reserved for taxpayers whose risk of noncompliance does not warrant use of IRS resources. We believe that participation in CAP should reduce tax-related uncertainties, if any. Additionally, with a few exceptions, as of December 30, 2022, we are no longer subject to state, local, or foreign examinations by the tax authorities for fiscal years ended on or before December 28, 2018. \n\nDuring the next 12 months, we expect our balance of unrecognized tax benefits to decrease by $ 20 million related to capitalized research and development costs. While we believe we have adequate accruals for uncertain tax positions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe taxes in excess of recorded accruals or the recorded accruals may be in excess of the final settlement amounts agreed to by tax authorities. \n\nNote 19&#8212;Retirement Plans \n\nDefined Contribution Plans \n\nWe sponsor various defined contribution plans in which most employees are eligible to participate. These plans allow eligible participants to contribute a portion of their income through payroll deductions and Leidos may also make discretionary contributions. Company contributions were $ 145 million, $ 131 million and $ 120 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nDeferred Compensation Plans \n\nWe maintain three deferred compensation plans, the Keystaff Deferral Plan (\"KDP\"), the KESDP and the MSCP (the \"Plans\"), for the benefit of certain management or highly compensated employees or members of the Board of Directors. The Plans allow eligible participants to elect to defer a portion of their salary, and all or a portion of certain bonuses, including restricted stock unit awards. Directors may also elect to defer their cash compensation in addition to their restricted stock unit awards. Deferred balances in the Plans are paid in lump sum or installments upon retirement, termination or the elected specified date. \n\nWe do not make any contributions to the KDP but maintain participant accounts for deferred amounts and investments. We maintain a rabbi trust for the purpose of funding benefit payments to the KDP participants. Participants may allocate deferred salary and cash bonus amounts into a variety of designated investment options, with gains and losses based on the elected investment option performance with the participant assuming all risks related to future returns of their contributions. \n\nUnder the KESDP, eligible participants may elect to defer in share units all or a portion of certain cash bonuses and restricted stock unit awards granted under the previous 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and the current 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (see \"Note 17&#8212;Stock-Based Compensation\"). Under the MSCP, restricted stock share units are fully vested and no further deferrals into the plan are made. We do not make any contributions to the accounts of KESDP or MSCP participants. Benefits from the KESDP and MSCP are payable in shares of Leidos common stock held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of funding benefit payments to KESDP and MSCP participants. \n\nDefined Benefit Plans \n\nWe sponsor two frozen defined benefit pension plans (\"the Plans\"), one in the United Kingdom (\"UK\") for former employees on an expired customer contract and another assumed as a result of the Gibbs &#38; Cox acquisition. \n\nOn May 20, 2022, the trustee of our UK defined benefit pension plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) invested the assets of the Plan in a bulk purchase annuity policy to fully insure the benefits payable to the members of the Plan. As the buy-in transaction insured the defined benefit obligation, we do not anticipate material future contributions. \n\nThe bulk purchase annuity policy is structured to enable the Plan to move to a full buy-out, at which time the insurer would become directly responsible for all pension payments and we would be relieved of our obligations under the Plan. At this future date, a settlement loss will be recognized for an amount equal to any unamortized loss associated with the Plan recorded within AOCI and any remaining net plan assets of the Plan will be remitted to the Company. As of December 30, 2022, the unamortized loss within AOCI related to the Plan was $ 20 million and the Plan had net assets of $ 7 million. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 105 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nThe projected benefit obligation of the Plans as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, was $ 101 million and $ 160 million, respectively. The decrease in the projected benefit obligation was primarily due to assumption changes and an actuarial gain. \n\nThe fair value of the Plans assets as of December 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, was $ 101 million and $ 189 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by assumption changes to reflect the fair value of the annuity contract and return on plan assets. The UK Plan funding status was overfunded $ 7 million and $ 37 million as of December 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Gibbs &#38; Cox defined benefit pension plan funding status was underfunded $ 7 million and $ 8 million as of December 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of Plans assets has been included within \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nOther \n\nWe also sponsor multiemployer defined benefit pension plans and a defined contribution plan (a 401(k) plan) (the \"Sponsored Plans\") for employees working on two U.S. government contracts. As part of the contractual agreements, the customers reimburse Leidos for contributions made to these Sponsored Plans as these costs are allowable under government contract cost accounting requirements. If we were to cease being the contractor as a result of a recompetition process, the defined benefit pension plans and related plan assets and liabilities would transfer to the new contractor. If the contract expires or is terminated with no transfer of the pension plan to a successor contractor, any amount by which the plan liabilities exceed plan assets, as of that date, will be reimbursed by the U.S. government customer. Since we are not responsible for the current or future funded status of the pension plans, no assets or liabilities arising from their funded status are recorded in the consolidated financial statements and no amounts associated with these pension plans are included in the defined benefit plan disclosures above. \n\nNote 20&#8212;Business Segments \n\nOur operations and reportable segments are organized around the customers and markets we serve. We define our reportable segments based on the way the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), currently the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, manages the operations for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. \n\nOur business is aligned into three reportable segments (Defense Solutions, Civil and Health). Additionally, we separately present the unallocable costs associated with corporate functions as Corporate. \n\nEffective July 3, 2021, certain contracts were reassigned from the Defense Solutions reportable segment to the Civil reportable segment. Impact on prior year segment results were determined to be immaterial and have not been recast to reflect this change. \n\nDefense Solutions provides leading-edge and technologically advanced services, solutions and products to a broad customer base.

As a result, \"Interest expense, net,\" \"Other expense, net,\" and \"Income tax expense,\" as reported in the consolidated financial statements are not allocated to our segments. Under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards, indirect costs including depreciation expense are collected in indirect cost pools, which are then collectively allocated out to the reportable segments based on a representative causal or beneficial relationship of the costs in the pool to the costs in the base. While depreciation expense is a component of the allocated costs, the allocation process precludes depreciation expense from being specifically identified by the individual reportable segments. For this reason, depreciation expense by reportable segment has not been reported above. \n\nAsset information by segment is not a key measure of performance used by the CODM. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 107 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nWe generated approximately 86 % of our total revenues in fiscal 2022, and 87 % in fiscal 2021 and 2020 from contracts with the U.S. government, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government. Revenues under contracts with the DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community, including subcontracts under which the DoD or the U.S. Intelligence Community is the ultimate purchaser, represented approximately 44 % of our total revenues for fiscal 2022, 44 % for fiscal 2021 and 49 % for fiscal 2020. \n\nApproximately 8 % of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated by or owned by entities outside of the United States. As such, additional financial information by geographic location is not presented. \n\nNote 21&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies \n\nLegal Proceedings \n\nWe are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of our business, none of which, in the opinion of management, based upon current information, will likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nContingencies \n\nVirnetX, Inc. (\"VirnetX\") \n\nOn April 10, 2018, a jury trial concluded in an additional patent infringement case brought by VirnetX against Apple, referred to as the Apple II case, in which the jury returned a verdict against Apple for infringement and awarded VirnetX damages in the amount of over $ 502 million. On April 11, 2018, in a second phase of the Apple II trial, the jury found Apple's infringement to be willful. On August 30, 2018, the federal trial court in the Eastern District of Texas entered a final judgment and rulings on post-trial motions in the Apple II case. The court affirmed the jury&#8217;s verdict of over $ 502 million and granted VirnetX&#8217;s motions for supplemental damages, a sunset royalty and royalty rate of $ 1.20 per infringing device, along with pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and costs. The court denied VirnetX&#8217;s motions for enhanced damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and an injunction. The court also denied Apple&#8217;s motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. An additional sum of over $ 93 million for costs and pre-judgment interest was subsequently agreed upon pursuant to a court order, bringing the total award to VirnetX in the Apple II case to over $ 595 million. Apple filed an appeal of the judgment in the Apple II case with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and on November 22, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded the Apple II case back to the District Court. The Federal Circuit affirmed that Apple infringed two of the patents at issue in the case, and ruled that Apple is precluded from making certain patent invalidity arguments. However, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment that Apple infringed two other patents at issue, vacated the prior damages awarded in the Apple II case, and remanded the Apple II case back to the District Court for further proceedings regarding damages. On April 23, 2020, the District Court ordered a new trial on damages in the Apple II case, which was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic and started on October 26, 2020. On October 30, 2020, the jury awarded VirnetX $ 503 million in damages and specified a royalty rate of $ 0.84 per infringing device. In January 2021, the District Court entered final judgment affirming the jury award and the parties separately agreed on additional costs and interest of over $ 75 million, subject to Apple's appeal. On February 4, 2021, Apple filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the Apple II case. \n\nUnder our agreements with VirnetX, Leidos would receive 25 % of the proceeds obtained by VirnetX after reduction for attorneys' fees and costs. However, the verdict in the Apple II case remains subject to the ongoing and potential future proceedings and appeals. In addition, the patents at issue in these cases are subject to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office post-grant inter partes review and/or reexamination proceedings and related appeals, which may result in all or part of these patents being invalidated or the claims of the patents being limited. Thus, no assurances can be given when or if we will receive any proceeds in connection with these jury awards. In addition, if Leidos receives any proceeds, we are required to pay a royalty to the customer who paid for the development of the technology. \n\nGovernment Investigations and Reviews \n\nWe are routinely subject to investigations and reviews relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal, state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside of the United States. Adverse findings could have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows due to our reliance on government contracts. \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 108 \n\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDefense Contract Audit Agency \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, active indirect cost audits by the DCAA remain open for fiscal 2021 and subsequent fiscal years. Although we have recorded contract revenues based upon an estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review, we cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and, if future adjustments exceed estimates, our profitability may be adversely affected. As of December 30, 2022, we believe we have adequately reserved for potential adjustments from audits or reviews of contract costs. \n\nOther Government Investigations and Reviews \n\nThrough its internal processes, the Company discovered, in late 2021, activities by its employees, third party representatives and subcontractors, raising concerns related to a portion of our business that conducts international operations. The Company is conducting an internal investigation, overseen by an independent committee of the Board of Directors, with the assistance of external legal counsel, to determine whether the identified conduct may have violated the Company&#8217;s Code of Conduct and potentially applicable laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). The Company has voluntarily self-reported this investigation to the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is cooperating with both agencies. Because the investigation is ongoing, the Company cannot anticipate the timing, outcome or possible impact of the investigation, although violations of the FCPA and other applicable laws may result in criminal and civil sanctions, including monetary penalties, and reputational damage. In September 2022, the Company received a Federal Grand Jury Subpoena related to the criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of California, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s Fraud Section. The subpoena requests documents relating to the conduct that is the subject of the Company&#8217;s internal investigation. The Company is in the process of responding to the subpoena. \n\nIn August 2022, the Company received a Federal Grand Jury Subpoena in connection with a criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;). The subpoena requests that the Company produce a broad range of documents related to three U.S. Government procurements associated with the Company&#8217;s Intelligence Group in 2021 and 2022. We intend to fully cooperate with the investigation, and we are conducting our own internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel. It is not possible at this time to determine whether we will incur, or to reasonably estimate the amount of, any fines, penalties, or further liabilities in connection with the investigation pursuant to which the subpoena was issued. \n\nCommitments \n\nWe have outstanding letters of credit of $ 72 million as of December 30, 2022, principally related to performance guarantees on contracts. We also have outstanding surety bonds with a notional amount of $ 100 million as of December 30, 2022, principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds on contracts. The value of the surety bonds may vary due to changes in the underlying project status and/or contractual modifications. We also have future lease commitments of $ 74 million for the use of certain aircraft. \n\nAs of December 30, 2022, the future expirations of the outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and future lease commitments were as follows: ##TABLE_START Fiscal year ending (in millions) 2023 $ 60 &#160; 2024 104 &#160; 2025 37 &#160; 2026 19 &#160; 2027 22 &#160; 2028 and thereafter 4 &#160; $ 246 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

Controls and Procedures \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer (our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 30, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. &#160; \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed our acquisition of Cobham Special Mission. As part of the ongoing integration of Cobham Special Mission, we are in the process of incorporating the controls and related procedures of these businesses. Other than incorporating controls for Cobham Special Mission, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the fourth quarter of the period ended December 30, 2022, covered by this Annual Report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nAs permitted by the SEC rules, management's assessment and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, excludes an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting of Cobham Special Mission, acquired on October 30, 2022. Cobham Special Mission represents approximately 1.55% of our consolidated total assets, excluding the preliminary value of goodwill and intangible assets related to Cobham Special Mission, at December 30, 2022, and 0.15% and 0.28% of our consolidated revenues and operating income, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2022. \n\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, and has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of that date was effective. \n\nDeloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our internal control over financial reporting, and that firm&#8217;s report on our internal control over financial reporting is set forth below. \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 110 \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Leidos Holdings, Inc. \n\nReston, Virginia \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Leidos Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \n\nAs described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Cobham Special Mission, which was acquired on October 30, 2022, and whose financial statements constitute total assets of 1.55%, excluding the preliminary value of goodwill and intangible assets, 0.15% of revenues, and 0.28% of operating income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Cobham Special Mission. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nMcLean, Virginia \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.
