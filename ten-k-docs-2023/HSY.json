      "text": " Item 1. BUSINESS \n\nThe Hershey Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24, 1927 as a successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey. In this report, the terms &#8220;Hershey,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean The Hershey Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which it has a controlling financial interest, unless the context indicates otherwise. \n\nHershey is a global confectionery leader known for making more moments of goodness through chocolate, sweets, mints and other great tasting snacks. We are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America, a leading snack maker in the United States and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. We market, sell and distribute our products under more than 100 brand names in approximately 80 countries worldwide. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nThe Company reports its operations through three segments: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International. This organizational structure aligns with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) manages our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment, and further aligns with our product categories and the key markets we serve. \n\n&#8226; North America Confectionery &#8211; This segment is responsible for our traditional chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position in the United States and Canada. This includes our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines. This segment also includes our retail operations, including Hershey&#8217;s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain of the Company&#8217;s trademarks and products to third parties around the world. \n\n&#8226; North America Salty Snacks &#8211; This segment is responsible for our salty snacking products in the United States. This includes ready-to-eat popcorn, baked and trans fat free snacks, pretzels and other snacks. \n\n&#8226; International &#8211; International is a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually material, including those geographic regions where we operate outside of North America. We currently have operations and manufacture product in Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia, primarily for consumers in these regions, and also distribute and sell confectionery products in export markets of Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Europe, Africa and other regions. \n\nFinancial and other information regarding our segments is provided in our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures \n\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pretzels Inc. (&#8220;Pretzels&#8221;), previously a privately held company that manufactures and sells pretzels and other salty snacks for other branded products and private labels in the United States. Pretzels is an industry leader in the pretzel category with a product portfolio that includes filled, gluten free and seasoned pretzels, as well as extruded snacks that complements Hershey&#8217;s snacks portfolio. Based in Bluffton, Indiana, Pretzels operates three manufacturing locations in Indiana and Kansas. Pretzels provides Hershey deep pretzel category and product expertise and the manufacturing capabilities to support brand growth and future pretzel innovation. Additionally in December 2021, we completed the acquisition of Dot&#8217;s Pretzels, LLC (&#8220;Dot&#8217;s&#8221;), previously a privately held company that produces and sells pretzels and other snack food products to retailers and distributors in the United States, with Dot&#8217;s Homestyle Pretzels snacks as its primary product. Dot&#8217;s is the fastest-growing scale brand in the pretzel category and complements Hershey&#8217;s snacks portfolio. \n\nIn June 2021, we completed the acquisition of Lily&#8217;s Sweets, LLC (&#8220;Lily&#8217;s&#8221;), previously a privately held company that sells a line of sugar-free and low-sugar confectionery foods to retailers and distributors in the United States and Canada. Lily&#8217;s products include dark and milk chocolate style bars, baking chips, peanut butter cups and other confection products that complement Hershey&#8217;s confectionery and confectionery-based portfolio. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 2 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn January 2021, we completed the divestiture of Lotte Shanghai Foods Co., Ltd. (&#8220;LSFC&#8221;), which was previously included within the International segment results in our consolidated financial statements. Total proceeds from the divestiture and the impact on our consolidated financial statements were immaterial. \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we completed the divestitures of KRAVE Pure Foods, Inc. (&#8220;Krave&#8221;), which was previously included within the North America Salty Snacks segment, and the Scharffen Berger and Dagoba brands, both of which were previously included within the North America Confectionery segment results in our consolidated financial statements. Total proceeds from the divestitures and the impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income, both individually and on an aggregate basis, were immaterial. \n\nProducts and Brands \n\nOur principal product offerings include chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products; gum and mint refreshment products and protein bars; snack items such as popcorn, pretzels, spreads, snack bites and mixes; and pantry items, such as baking ingredients, toppings and beverages. \n\n&#8226; Within our North America Confectionery segment, our product portfolio includes a wide variety of chocolate offerings marketed and sold under the renowned brands of Hershey&#8217;s , Reese&#8217;s and Kisses , along with other popular chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery brands such as Jolly Rancher , Almond Joy , Brookside, barkTHINS , Cadbury, Good &#38; Plenty , Heath , Kit Kat &#174; , Payday , Rolo &#174; , Twizzlers , Whoppers and York . Our protein bar products include ONE bar and our gum and mint products include Ice Breakers mints and chewing gum, Breath Savers mints and Bubble Yum bubble gum. We also have pantry items, including baking products, toppings and sundae syrups sold under the Hershey&#8217;s, Reese&#8217;s, Heath and Lily&#8217;s brands, as well as Hershey&#8217;s and Reese&#8217;s chocolate spreads and snack bites and mixes. \n\n&#8226; Within our North America Salty Snacks segment, we have our salty snack items. This includes ready-to-eat SkinnyPop popcorn, baked and trans fat free Pirates Booty snacks, Dot&#8217;s Homestyle Pretzels snacks and other snack brands such as Paqui. \n\n&#8226; Within our International segment, we manufacture, market and sell many of these same brands, as well as other brands that are marketed regionally, such as Pelon Pelo Rico confectionery products in Mexico, IO-IO snack products in Brazil and Sofit beverage products in India. \n\nPrincipal Customers and Marketing Strategy \n\nOur customers are mainly wholesale distributors, chain grocery stores, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, dollar stores, concessionaires and department stores. The majority of our customers, with the exception of wholesale distributors, resell our products to end-consumers in retail outlets in North America and other locations worldwide. \n\nIn 2022, approximately 28% of our consolidated net sales were made to McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. \n\nThe foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities, product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products. We devote considerable resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products. We utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers, as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products, to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year. \n\nIn conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts, our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers. We primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 3 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRaw Materials and Pricing \n\nCocoa products, including cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans, are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products. These cocoa products are purchased directly from third-party suppliers, who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in Far Eastern, West African, Central and South American regions. West Africa accounts for approximately 70% of the world&#8217;s supply of cocoa beans. \n\nAdverse changes in climate or extreme weather, crop disease, political unrest and other problems in cocoa-producing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past, but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country&#8217;s cocoa crop and/or exports. In the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country, we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer. \n\nOur trading company in Switzerland performs all aspects of cocoa procurement, including price risk management, physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight. The trading company optimizes the supply chain for our cocoa requirements, with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence. It also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups, the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources. \n\nWe also use substantial quantities of sugar, corn products, Class II and IV dairy products, wheat products, peanuts, almonds and energy in our production process. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. For our international operations, inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries. \n\nWe change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs, the competitive environment and profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. Price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs, including raw and packaging materials, fuel, utilities, transportation costs and employee benefits. When we implement price increases, there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales, in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases. In addition, promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date, delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nMany of our confectionery and salty snack brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in North America and certain international markets. We sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational, national, regional and local firms. Some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, as well as convenience and service. We have also experienced increased competition from other snack items, and through innovation and acquisitions, we are continuing to expand the boundaries of our brands to capture new snacking occasions. \n\nWorking Capital, Seasonality and Backlog \n\nOur sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year, representing seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt. Therefore, the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales. Additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 4 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTrademarks, Service Marks and License Agreements \n\nWe own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. The trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the United States and other key international markets where our products are sold. We also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items, flavored milks and various other products primarily under the Hershey&#8217;s and Reese&#8217;s brand names. \n\nFurthermore, we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell and distribute certain products. Our rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at our option. Our most significant licensing agreements are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Company \n\nBrand Location Requirements Kraft Foods Ireland Intellectual Property Limited/Cadbury UK Limited York Peter Paul Almond Joy Peter Paul Mounds Worldwide \n\nNone \n\nCadbury UK Limited Cadbury Caramello United States \n\nMinimum sales requirement exceeded in 2022 \n\nSoci&#233;t&#233; des Produits Nestl&#233; SA \n\nKit Kat &#174; \n\nRolo &#174; \n\nUnited States \n\nMinimum unit volume sales exceeded in 2022 \n\nIconic IP Interests, LLC Good &#38; Plenty \n\nHeath \n\nJolly Rancher \n\nMilk Duds \n\nPayday \n\nWhoppers \n\nWorldwide \n\nNone \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities in a number of countries, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia. We develop new products, improve the quality of existing products, improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning our research and development expense is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFood Quality and Safety Regulation \n\nThe manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the U.S. \n\nWe believe our Product Excellence Program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program. This program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase, manufacture and distribute are safe, are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations. \n\nThrough our Product Excellence Program, we evaluate our supply chain including ingredients, packaging, processes, products, distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary. We identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety. Various government agencies and third-party firms, as well as our quality assurance staff, conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 5 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nEnvironmental Considerations \n\nBeyond ordinary operating and capital expenditures that we make to comply with government regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, we have made a number of voluntary commitments to protect and reduce our environmental impacts in recent years, including efforts to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation and reduce greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions across our own operations and supply chain. Our climate change related investments and expenditures primarily focus on achieving a 50% absolute reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and a 25% absolute reduction in our Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to a 2018 baseline), as well as having 100% of plastic packaging be recyclable, reusable or compostable and 25 million pounds of packaging be eliminated by 2030. The annual operating and capital expenditures associated with these ordinary course payments and additional climate change commitments are not material with respect to our results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. \n\nSustainability \n\nThe Company&#8217;s commitment to sustainability started with our founder&#8217;s belief in responsible citizenship. He was a purpose-driven leader who believed we could use chocolate to Make More Moments of Goodness in the world for our consumers today and for many generations to come. This belief resulted in a strong investment in local communities and the establishment of Milton Hershey School for disadvantaged kids. We continue that legacy today through our holistic environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) strategy: our Shared Goodness Promise, which guides how we empower the remarkable people who make and sell our brands, interact with farming communities that grow our ingredients, deliver on our commitments to consumers, customers, and external stakeholders, protect the environment and support children and youth. \n\nTo learn more about our ESG-related goals, progress and initiatives, as well as review our annual ESG Report and accompanying suite of ESG reporting frameworks, policies, and disclosures, access the Sustainability section of our website at: https://www.thehersheycompany.com/en_us/sustainability.html . Information found on the Company&#8217;s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). \n\nFinancial Information by Geographic Area \n\nOur principal operations and markets are located in the United States. The percentage of total consolidated net sales for our businesses outside of the United States was 12.5% for 2022, 13.0% for 2021 and 13.6% for 2020. The percentage of total long-lived assets outside of the United States was 17.9% as of December 31, 2022 and 18.8% as of December 31, 2021. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 18,075 full-time and 1,790 part-time employees worldwide. Collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 6,470 employees, or approximately 33% of the Company&#8217;s employees worldwide. During 2023, agreements are expected to be negotiated for certain employees at five facilities, four of which are outside of the United States, comprising approximately 67% of total employees under collective bargaining agreements. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, as evidenced by a strong culture and a good relationship between the Company and our employees. \n\nWe are a purpose-driven company and for more than a century, our iconic brands have been built on a foundation of community investment and connections between people around the world. We could not have achieved this without our remarkable employees who make our purpose a reality. As a result, our human capital strategies are material to our operations and core to the long-term success of the Company. \n\n&#8226; Our People, Safety and Employee Engagement . Our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We provide a workplace that develops, supports and motivates our people. The overall well-being and safety of our employees remains one of our top priorities. We continue to invest in training, workplace resources and leading systems and processes to ensure the responsible management of all facilities. Additionally, continuous listening surveys are distributed throughout the year to all employees globally. These short and fast surveys reach all of our employees around the world to hear their thoughts on the Company&#8217;s direction and their place in it. These continuous touchpoints allow for real-time feedback and action from the Company. These surveys are further supplemented with quarterly and \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 6 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ninformative enterprise and team town halls, which, in conjunction with the continuous listening surveys, generate stronger employee engagement with the Company&#8217;s strategy, initiatives and leadership. Further, in June 2022, the Company conducted its first annual Ethics and Compliance Survey to assess employees&#8217; perception of the health of ethics and compliance at Hershey. \n\n&#8226; Talent Acquisition, Development and Training . Hiring and developing our employees is critically important to our operations and we are focused on creating experiences and programs that foster growth and performance. We provide all employees the chance to learn, grow and own their work. We have partnered with leading online content experts and increased internal learning development to expand our catalog of online and classroom courses. Additionally, we have co-created a culture of development with the enthusiastic support of our employees. Through individual development plans, learning opportunities, feedback and coaching, employees can build careers at The Hershey Company, as evidenced by the fact that the majority of our eight executive officers were promoted from within the organization (see Information about Our Executive Officers ). \n\n&#8226; Compensation, Benefits and Wellness . In addition to offering competitive, fair and transparent compensation, we also offer a suite of benefits, including comprehensive health and meaningful retirement benefits to eligible employees, tying incentive compensation to both business and individual performance, offering parental leave and adoption benefits and maintaining an employee stock purchase plan. We also provide a number of innovative programs designed to promote physical and emotional well-being, including ergonomic workspaces, a state-of-the-art fitness center at our Hershey, Pennsylvania campus and private rooms designed for quiet reflection, prayer or wellness breaks. The Company also offers SmartFlex benefits which is our suite of policies that allows individuals to create their own balance between work and personal life, including flexing work time based on work priorities or personal commitments, such as caring for children or family members. We believe that this flexibility improves productivity, job satisfaction and increases employee engagement. Additionally, the Company offers a &#8220;Best of Both&#8221; flexible work model for corporate and commercial employees to balance work and personal well-being. This model allows employees the option to work either remote, in-office, or both, depending on individual needs, personal schedules and work demands. This offers the benefits of flexibility and in-person collaboration, while maintaining productivity and overall job satisfaction. \n\n&#8226; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion . Our diverse and inclusive culture makes the difference across all areas of the business around the world. Our gender representation includes women occupying many of the top positions in the Company, including Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Chief Accounting Officer and President, Salty Snacks, and approximately 50% representation across the Company. Additionally, five of our 12 Board members are women (42% representation). In 2022, we maintained fair and equitable pay achievements, including 1:1 aggregate people of color pay equity for salaried employees in the United States (2021) and 1:1 aggregate gender pay (2020). Further, our eight employee-led Business Resource Groups, which include Abilities First, African American, Asian, GenH (Generations), Latino, Prism (LGBTQ), Veteran&#8217;s and Women&#8217;s, play a critical role in attracting diverse talent, providing mentoring and career development opportunities, delivering commercial business insights and connecting people to the Company and the communities where we do business. In 2022, the Company was ranked #6 on DiversityInc&#8217;s Top 50 Companies for Diversity and was ranked as a top 50 company on Forbes Top Female Friendly Companies. Additionally, the Company also ranked as a top 30 company on Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Top 250 Best-Managed Companies of 2022. \n\n&#8226; Community and Social Impact . Our philanthropy and volunteerism efforts reflect how we live out the Company&#8217;s value of making moments of goodness, from supporting causes our employees care about to investing in the long-term success of the communities where we live and work. We work closely with counterparts in each of our plant and office locations across the United States and globally to identify local community needs and craft tailored approaches to provide support. This work includes forging partnerships with local non-governmental organizations, providing grants and contributions and organizing volunteer service activities and employee fundraisers. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 7 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company's website address is www.thehersheycompany.com .

RISK FACTORS \n\nYou should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face, and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business, performance or financial condition in the future. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations \n\nOur Company&#8217;s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results. \n\nIn order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers, consumers, suppliers, vendors and employees, among others. Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company&#8217;s image and reputation. We have in the past and may in the future need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption. Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. In addition, negative publicity related to our environmental, social or governance practices could also impact our reputation with customers, consumers, suppliers and vendors. \n\nWe have been in the past and in the future could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which could result in payments of fines or damages. Costs associated with these potential actions, as well as the potential impact on our reputation or ability to sell our products, could negatively affect our operating results. \n\nDisruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results. \n\nApproximately 70% of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States. Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following: \n\n&#8226; Natural disaster; \n\n&#8226; Pandemic outbreak of disease (such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) global pandemic); \n\n&#8226; Climate change and severity of extreme weather; \n\n&#8226; Fire or explosion; \n\n&#8226; Terrorism or other acts of violence; \n\n&#8226; Labor strikes or other labor activities; \n\n&#8226; Unavailability of raw or packaging materials; \n\n&#8226; Operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers; and \n\n&#8226; Suboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to cost-effectively meet product demand. \n\nWe believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions. We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy. If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for, mitigate or manage operational stability and business resiliency, particularly within our international markets and snacks portfolio, due to the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 9 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global human capital we need to drive our growth strategies. \n\nOur future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe. Competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise, our business performance may be impacted. \n\nActivities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. \n\nIn addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRisks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts, and increased focus and evolving views of our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders on climate change issues, could negatively affect our business and operations. \n\nClimate-related changes can increase variability in, or otherwise impact, natural disasters, including weather patterns, with the potential for increased frequency and severity of significant weather events, natural hazards, rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns. Climate change or weather-related disruptions to our supply chain can impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. \n\nIncreased focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change, including regulation of GHG emissions. New or increasing laws and regulations related to GHG emissions and other climate change related concerns may adversely affect us, our suppliers and our customers, and may require additional capital investments. Our value chain faces similar challenges as our products rely on agricultural ingredients and a global supply chain. Climate change poses a significant and increasing risk to global food production systems and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work and source our ingredients. The GHG impacts of land-use change are most pronounced in our cocoa supply chain, where we have already been working for several years to prevent deforestation. Additionally, any non-compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements could negatively impact our reputation and ability to do business. \n\nInvestors, customers, advisory services, government regulators and other market participants have increasingly focused on the environmental or sustainability practices of companies, including Hershey. Shareholders and financial institutions have increasingly evaluated a company&#8217;s ESG practices, disclosures and performance before making investments or other financial decisions. We believe our practices, disclosures and performance are strong and growing. However, if our environmental goals do not meet investor or other external stakeholder expectations and standards, our access to capital may be negatively impacted. An enforcement action could harm our reputation, financial position and ability to grow. A failure to meet expectations may adversely affect our results of operations, ability to manage our liquidity, or implement our strategies. \n\nThe Company publishes its environmental goals, with a particular focus on achieving a 50% absolute reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and a 25% absolute reduction in our Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to a 2018 baseline), as well as having 100% of plastic packaging be reusable, recyclable or compostable and 25 million pounds of packaging be eliminated by 2030. The costs of these voluntary commitments may be greater than expected, and there can be no assurance the Company will achieve its goals, or meet the evolving sustainability expectations and standards of our investors or other external stakeholders. Any failure to achieve our goals, a perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment, or failure to respond to new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business, reputation and increase risk of litigation. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 10 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe effects and costs of climate change, or any failure to meet related requirements and expectations, could have a negative impact on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRisks Related to the Industry in Which We Operate \n\nIncreases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. \n\nWe use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, corn products, dairy products, wheat products, peanuts, almonds, natural gas and diesel fuel. \n\nCommodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including: \n\n&#8226; Commodity market fluctuations; \n\n&#8226; Currency exchanges rates; \n\n&#8226; Imbalances between supply and demand; \n\n&#8226; Rising levels of inflation and interest rates related to domestic and global economic conditions or supply chain issues; \n\n&#8226; The effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality; \n\n&#8226; Speculative influences; \n\n&#8226; Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations; \n\n&#8226; Supplier compliance with commitments; \n\n&#8226; Import/export requirements for raw materials and finished goods; \n\n&#8226; Political unrest in producing countries; \n\n&#8226; Introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements; \n\n&#8226; Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies; and \n\n&#8226; Other events beyond our control such as the impacts on the business or supply chain arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. \n\nAlthough we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs. If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nPrice increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity. \n\nWe may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes (including if inflation outpaces our pricing elasticity) sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, freight, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nMarket demand for new and existing products could decline. \n\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers. Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following: \n\n&#8226; Effective retail execution; \n\n&#8226; Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs; \n\n&#8226; Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations; \n\n&#8226; Our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories; \n\n&#8226; Changes in product category consumption; \n\n&#8226; Our response to consumer demographics and trends, including but not limited to, trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing digital commerce channel; and \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 11 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8226; Consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients. \n\nThere continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively. Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 28% of our total net sales in 2022. McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. \n\nIncreased marketplace competition could hurt our business. \n\nThe global confectionery and snacks packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues. Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations. We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which has pressured confectionery category growth. In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products. Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment. \n\nRisks Related to Strategic Initiatives \n\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. \n\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval. These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management&#8217;s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nIn 2021, we successfully completed the divestiture of LSFC as we better prioritize resources against assets and brands that fit our business model and scale capabilities. Additionally, we completed the acquisitions of Lily&#8217;s in June 2021 and Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels in December 2021. While we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions, achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage Hershey&#8217;s resources, expertise, capability-building, distribution locations and customer base. In addition, the acquisitions of Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking, as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle. If we are unable to successfully couple Hershey&#8217;s scale and expertise in brand building with Lily&#8217;s, Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels&#8217; existing operations, it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 12 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. \n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we derived approximately 12.5%, 13.0% and 13.6% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States. Additionally, approximately 18% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2022. As part of our strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil and India. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including: \n\n&#8226; The inability to manage operational stability and business resiliency within our international markets due to unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand; \n\n&#8226; The inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets; \n\n&#8226; Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations; \n\n&#8226; Unexpected changes in regulatory environments; \n\n&#8226; Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict; \n\n&#8226; Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments; \n\n&#8226; Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation; \n\n&#8226; Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; \n\n&#8226; The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; \n\n&#8226; Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; \n\n&#8226; The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; \n\n&#8226; Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and \n\n&#8226; Failure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce. \n\nIf we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business. \n\nWe depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes. Recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce, to transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights. If we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market, if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nAdditionally, from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth, such as the International Optimization Program, which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020. This program is intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 13 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRisks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes \n\nChanges in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products. \n\nChanges in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation compliance and requirements, competition laws, employment laws, import/export requirements and environmental laws, among others. It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nPolitical, economic and/or financial market conditions, including impacts on our business arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could negatively impact our financial results. \n\nOur operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases, which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, broad political instability, rising unemployment, pandemic outbreak of disease (such as COVID-19), climate change, weather, natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition. \n\nChanges in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers. A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense. \n\nAdditionally, in February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and this conflict is still ongoing. In response, the U.S. and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and may impose further sanctions that could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. With respect to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change. The Company&#8217;s efforts to manage and mitigate any direct or indirect effects from this conflict may ultimately be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration of the conflict and potential governmental actions. The potential effects of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may also impact many of the other risk factors described herein. \n\nRisks Related to Digital Transformation, Cybersecurity and Data Privacy \n\nDisruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations. \n\nInformation technology is critically important to our business operations. We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and other third parties. \n\nWe are regularly the target of cyber, ransomware and other security threats. Therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company&#8217;s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry-accepted methods and remediate significant findings. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards. We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business resiliency preparedness. We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from our implementation of new software and systems. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 14 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWhile we have been subject to cyber attacks, ransomware and other security breaches, these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations. We believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security and data breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees and those with whom we do business. This in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations. In addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant. \n\nComplications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations. \n\nWe rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) system. This ERP system will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company&#8217;s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company&#8217;s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing further delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be further delayed. \n\n"

Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nThe MD&#38;A is organized in the following sections: \n\n&#8226; Business Model and Growth Strategy \n\n&#8226; Overview \n\n&#8226; Trends Affecting Our Business \n\n&#8226; Consolidated Results of Operations \n\n&#8226; Segment Results \n\n&#8226; Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#8226; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nBUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH STRATEGY \n\nWe are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America, a leading snack maker in the United States and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. We report our operations through three segments: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International, as discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOur vision is to be a leading snacking powerhouse. We aspire to be a leader in meeting consumers&#8217; evolving snacking needs while strengthening the capabilities that drive our growth. We are focused on four strategic imperatives to ensure the Company&#8217;s success now and in the future: \n\n&#8226; Drive Core Confection Business and Broaden Participation in Snacking . We continue to be the undisputed leader in U.S. confection by taking actions to deepen our consumer connections and utilize our beloved brands to deliver meaningful innovation, while also diversifying our portfolio to capture profitable and incremental growth across the broader snacking continuum. \n\n&#9702; Our products frequently play an important role in special moments among family and friends. Seasons are an important part of our business model and for consumers, as they are highly anticipated, cherished times, centered around traditions. For us, it&#8217;s an opportunity for our brands to be part of many connections during the year when family and friends gather. \n\n&#9702; Innovation is an important lever in this variety-seeking category and we are leveraging work from our proprietary demand landscape analytical tool to shape our future innovation and make it more impactful. We are becoming more disciplined in our focus on platform innovation, which should enable sustainable growth over time and significant extensions to our core. \n\n&#9702; To expand our breadth in snacking, we are focused on expanding the boundaries of our core confection brands to capture new snacking occasions and increasing our exposure into new snack categories through acquisitions. Our expansion into snacking recently has been fueled by the acquisitions of Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels in December 2021, which are included in our North America Salty Snacks segment. \n\n&#8226; Deliver Profitable International Growth . We are focused on ensuring that we efficiently allocate our resources to the areas with the highest potential for profitable growth. We have reset our international investment strategy, while holding fast to our belief that our targeted emerging market strategy will deliver long-term, profitable growth. The uncertain macroeconomic environment in many of these markets is expected to continue and we aim to ensure our investments in these international markets are appropriate relative to the size of the opportunity. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 20 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8226; Expand Competitive Advantage through Differentiated Capabilities . In order to generate actionable insights, we must acquire, integrate, access and utilize vast sources of the right data in an effective manner. We are working to leverage our advanced data and analytical techniques to gain a deep understanding of our consumers, our customers, our shoppers, our end-to-end supply chain, our retail environment and key economic drivers at both a macro and precision level, including digital transformation and new media models. In addition, we are in the process of transforming our supply chain capabilities and enterprise resource planning system, which will enable employees to work more efficiently and effectively. \n\n&#8226; Responsibly Manage Our Operations to Ensure the Long-Term Sustainability of Our Business, Our Planet and Our People . We are a purpose-driven company and for more than a century, our iconic brands have been built on a foundation of community investment and connections between people around the world. We could not have achieved this without our remarkable employees who make our purpose a reality. We believe our long-standing values make our Company a special place to work. \n\n&#9702; We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We utilize continuous listening surveys that are distributed throughout the year to all employees globally. These short and fast surveys reach all of our employees around the world to hear their thoughts on the Company&#8217;s direction and their place in it. These continuous touchpoints allow for real-time feedback and action from the Company. These surveys are further supplemented with quarterly and informative enterprise and team town halls, which, in conjunction with the continuous listening surveys, generate stronger employee engagement with the Company&#8217;s strategy, initiatives and leadership. \n\n&#9702; Our diverse and inclusive culture makes the difference across all areas of the business. Our gender representation includes women occupying many of the top positions in the Company, including Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Chief Accounting Officer and President, Salty Snacks, and approximately 50% representation across the Company. In 2022, we maintained fair and equitable pay achievements, including 1:1 aggregate people of color pay equity for salaried employees in the United States (2021) and 1:1 aggregate gender pay (2020). \n\n&#9702; We have made strong progress on our ESG priorities and continue to elevate these ESG initiatives for a greater global impact. While we focus on sustainability and social impact across our value chain, we continue to improve and focus on the lives of cocoa farmers and cocoa communities, the environmental priorities of climate change and the role of packaging in our business, responsibly and sustainably sourcing the inputs to our products and increasing investments in human rights and diversity initiatives and growing diverse representation across the organization. \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nHershey is a global confectionery leader known for making more moments of goodness through chocolate, sweets, mints and other great tasting snacks. We are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America, a leading snack maker in the United States and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. We market, sell and distribute our products under more than 100 brand names in approximately 80 countries worldwide. \n\nOur principal product offerings include chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products; gum and mint refreshment products and protein bars; pantry items, such as baking ingredients, toppings and beverages; and snack items such as spreads, bars, and snack bites and mixes, popcorn and pretzels. \n\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures \n\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pretzels Inc. (&#8220;Pretzels&#8221;), previously a privately held company that manufactures and sells pretzels and other salty snacks for other branded products and private labels in the United States. Pretzels is an industry leader in the pretzel category with a product portfolio that includes filled, gluten free and seasoned pretzels, as well as extruded snacks that complements Hershey&#8217;s snacks portfolio. Based in Bluffton, Indiana, Pretzels operates three manufacturing locations in Indiana and Kansas. Pretzels provides Hershey with deep pretzel category and product expertise and the manufacturing capabilities to support brand growth and future pretzel innovation. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Dot&#8217;s Pretzels, LLC (&#8220;Dot&#8217;s&#8221;), previously a privately held company that produces and sells pretzels and other snack food products to retailers and distributors in the United States, with Dot&#8217;s Homestyle Pretzels snacks as its primary product. Dot&#8217;s is the fastest-growing scale brand in the pretzel category and complements Hershey&#8217;s snacks portfolio. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 21 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn June 2021, we completed the acquisition of Lily&#8217;s Sweets, LLC (&#8220;Lily&#8217;s&#8221;), previously a privately held company that sells a line of sugar-free and low-sugar confectionery foods to retailers and distributors in the United States and Canada. Lily&#8217;s products include dark and milk chocolate style bars, baking chips, peanut butter cups and other confection products that complement Hershey&#8217;s confectionery and confectionery-based portfolio. \n\nIn January 2021, we completed the divestiture of Lotte Shanghai Foods Co., Ltd. (&#8220;LSFC&#8221;), which was previously included within the International segment results in our consolidated financial statements. Total proceeds from the divestiture and the impact on our consolidated financial statements were immaterial. \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we completed the divestitures of KRAVE Pure Foods, Inc. (&#8220;Krave&#8221;), which was previously included within the North America Salty Snacks segment, and the Scharffen Berger and Dagoba brands, both of which were previously included within the North America Confectionery segment results in our consolidated financial statements. \n\nTRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS \n\nDemand for consumer goods has remained strong throughout 2022, with continued positive consumer patterns identified for our products, as well as increased consumer optimism and mobility, including retail foot traffic. However, negative macroeconomic conditions, including inflation on inputs to consumer products, labor shortages and demand outpacing supply, have led to broad-based supply chain disruptions across the U.S. and globally. As a result, we experienced corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures during the year ended December 31, 2022 (see Results of Operations included in this MD&#38;A). We are continuing to work closely with our business units, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and other external business partners to minimize the potential impact on our business. \n\nIn addition to broad-based supply chain disruptions, certain geopolitical events, specifically the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have increased global economic and political uncertainty. For the year ended December 31, 2022, this conflict did not have a material impact on our commodity prices or supply availability. However, we are continuing to monitor for any significant escalation or expansion of economic or supply chain disruptions or broader inflationary costs, which may result in material adverse effects on our results of operations. \n\nNet sales and net income increased during the year ended December 31, 2022, which was primarily driven by strong everyday performance on our core U.S. confection brands and salty snack brands (see Segment Results included in this MD&#38;A), partially offset by the aforementioned supply chain disruptions and gross margin pressures. As of December 31, 2022, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our key strategic initiatives and other material cash requirements in both the short-term and in the long-term; however, we continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can operate effectively during the current economic environment. We continue to monitor our discretionary spending across the organization (see Liquidity and Capital Resources included in this MD&#38;A). \n\nBased on the length and severity of broad-based supply chain disruptions, fluctuating levels of inflation, changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we may experience increasing supply chain costs and higher inflation. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential and evolving impacts on our business, consolidated results of operations, segment results, liquidity and capital resources. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 22 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n##TABLE_START Percent Change For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 2021 vs 2020 In millions of dollars except per share amounts Net sales $ 10,419.3 $ 8,971.3 $ 8,149.7 16.1 % 10.1 % Cost of sales 5,920.5 4,922.7 4,448.5 20.3 % 10.7 % Gross profit 4,498.8 4,048.6 3,701.2 11.1 % 9.4 % Gross margin 43.2 % 45.1 % 45.4 % SM&#38;A expense 2,236.0 2,001.4 1,890.9 11.7 % 5.8 % SM&#38;A expense as a percent of net sales 21.5 % 22.3% 23.2% Long-lived asset impairment charges &#8212; &#8212; 9.1 NM NM Business realignment costs 2.0 3.5 18.5 (43.6) % (80.9) % Operating profit 2,260.8 2,043.7 1,782.7 10.6 % 14.6 % Operating profit margin 21.7 % 22.8 % 21.9 % Interest expense, net 137.6 127.4 149.4 8.0 % (14.7) % Other (income) expense, net 206.1 119.1 138.3 73.1 % (13.9) % Provision for income taxes 272.3 314.4 219.6 (13.4) % 43.2 % Effective income tax rate 14.2 % 17.5 % 14.7 % Net income including noncontrolling interest 1,644.8 1,482.8 1,275.4 10.9 % 16.3 % Less: Net gain (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest &#8212; 5.3 (3.3) NM NM Net income attributable to The Hershey Company $ 1,644.8 $ 1,477.5 $ 1,278.7 11.3 % 15.5 % Net income per share&#8212;diluted $ 7.96 $ 7.11 $ 6.11 12.0 % 16.4 % Note: Percentage changes may not compute directly as shown due to rounding of amounts presented above. \n\nNM = not meaningful ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Sales \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nNet sales increased 16.1% in 2022 compared with 2021, reflecting a favorable price realization of 8.0% due to higher prices on certain products, a 4.3% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures driven by the 2021 acquisitions of Lily&#8217;s, Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels and a volume increase of 4.0% due to an increase in consumer demand primarily in everyday core U.S. confection brands and salty snack brands. These increases were slightly offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%. \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nNet sales increased 10.1% in 2021 compared with 2020, reflecting a volume increase of 5.6% due to an increase in everyday core U.S. confection brands and salty snack brands, a favorable price realization of 3.1% due to higher prices on certain products, a 1.0% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures driven by the 2021 acquisitions of Lily&#8217;s, Dot's and Pretzels and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.4%. \n\nKey U.S. Marketplace Metrics \n\nFor the full year 2022, our total U.S. retail takeaway increased 11.4% in the expanded multi-outlet combined plus convenience store channels (IRI MULO + C-Stores), which includes candy, mint, gum, salty snacks and grocery items. Our U.S. candy, mint and gum (&#8220;CMG&#8221;) consumer takeaway increased 10.7%, resulting in a CMG market share decline of approximately 54 basis points. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 23 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe CMG consumer takeaway and market share information reflect measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Information Resources, Incorporated (&#8220;IRI&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s market insights and analytics provider, and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category. \n\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nCost of sales increased 20.3% in 2022 compared with 2021. The increase was driven by higher sales volume, higher supply chain inflation costs, including higher logistics and labor costs and an incremental $40.8 million of unfavorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years&#8217; commodity purchases. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by favorable price realization and supply chain productivity. \n\nGross margin decreased by 200 basis points in 2022 compared with 2021. The decrease was driven by unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, higher supply chain inflation costs, including higher logistics and labor costs, and unfavorable product mix. These declines were offset by favorable price realization and volume increases. \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nCost of sales increased 10.7% in 2021 compared with 2020. The increase was driven by higher sales volume, higher freight and logistics costs and additional plant costs. These drivers were partially offset by the incremental $78.8 million of favorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years&#8217; commodity purchases; however, our mark-to-market activity was significantly impacted by financial market volatility during March 2020 amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by favorable price realization and supply chain productivity. \n\nGross margin decreased by 30 basis points in 2021 compared with 2020. The decrease was driven by higher freight and logistics costs and additional plant costs. These factors were partially offset by favorable price realization, supply chain productivity and the favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments. \n\nSelling, Marketing and Administrative \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nSelling, marketing and administrative (&#8220;SM&#38;A&#8221;) expenses increased $234.7 million, or 11.7%, in 2022 driven by increased corporate expenses. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses increased 2.7% driven by advertising increases in our confectionery brands and increased investment in our salty snacks portfolio, which were partially offset by cost efficiencies related to new media partners. SM&#38;A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased approximately 16.3% in 2022 driven by an increase in acquisition and integration related costs, as well as higher compensation costs, investments in capabilities and technology and broad-based marketplace inflation. \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nSM&#38;A expenses increased $110.4 million, or 5.8%, in 2021 driven by increased corporate expenses. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses decreased 0.2% driven by lower advertising in our North America Confectionery segment. SM&#38;A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased approximately 9.2% in 2021 driven by higher compensation costs and investments in capabilities and technology. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 24 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment Charges \n\nIn 2022 and 2021, we recorded no impairments charges. In 2020, we recorded the following impairment charges: ##TABLE_START For the year ended December 31, 2020 In millions of dollars Adjustment to disposal group (1) $ 6.2 Other asset write-down (2) 2.9 Long-lived asset impairment charges $ 9.1 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) In connection with our LSFC disposal group, which was previously classified as held for sale during 2020, we recorded impairment charges to adjust long-lived asset values. The fair value of the disposal group was supported by potential sales prices with third-party buyers. The sale of the LSFC joint venture was completed in January 2021. \n\n(2) In connection with a previous sale, the Company wrote-down certain receivables deemed uncollectible. \n\nThe assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions, as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. \n\nBusiness Realignment Activities \n\nWe periodically undertake business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business in support of our key growth strategies. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 , we recorded business realignment costs of $2.0 million, $3.5 million and $18.5 million, respectively. The 2022, 2021, and 2020 costs related primarily to the International Optimization Program, a program focused on optimizing our China operating model to improve our operational efficiency and provide for a strong, sustainable and simplified base going forward. Costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our Consolidated Statements of Income as described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOperating Profit and Operating Profit Margin \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nOperating profit increased 10.6% in 2022 compared with 2021 predominantly due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SM&#38;A expenses, as noted above. Operating profit margin decreased to 21.7% in 2022 from 22.8% in 2021 by the same factors noted above that resulted in lower gross margin for the period. \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nOperating profit increased 14.6% in 2021 compared with 2020 due primarily to higher gross profit, lower business realignment costs and lower impairment charges, partially offset by higher SM&#38;A in the 2021 period, as noted above. Operating profit margin increased to 22.8% in 2021 from 21.9% in 2020 driven by these same factors. \n\nInterest Expense, Net \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nNet interest expense was $10.1 million higher in 2022 than in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher rates on short-term debt balances in 2022 versus 2021, specifically related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings. The increase was partially offset due to lower average long-term debt balances, specifically resulting from the repayment of $84.7 million of 8.800% Debentures upon their maturity in February 2021 and $350 million of 3.100% Notes upon their maturity in May 2021. \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nNet interest expense was $22.0 million lower in 2021 than in 2020. The decrease was due to lower average long-term debt balances in 2021 versus 2020, specifically resulting from $435 million of long-term debt repayments with varying maturity dates during 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 25 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOther (Income) Expense, Net \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nOther (income) expense, net totaled an expense of $206.1 million in 2022 versus an expense of $119.1 million in 2021. The increase in the net expense was primarily due to higher write-downs on equity investments qualifying for tax credits in 2022 versus 2021 and higher non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nOther (income) expense, net totaled an expense of $119.1 million in 2021 versus an expense of $138.3 million in 2020. The decrease in the net expense was primarily due to lower write-downs on equity investments qualifying for historic and renewable energy tax credits, in addition to lower non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans during 2021 compared to the 2020 period. \n\nIncome Taxes and Effective Tax Rate \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nOur effective income tax rate was 14.2% for 2022 compared with 17.5% for 2021. Relative to the 21% statutory rate, the 2022 effective tax rate benefited from investment tax credits, partially offset by state taxes. The 2021 effective rate, relative to the 21% statutory rate, benefited from investment tax credits, partially offset by incremental tax reserves incurred as a result of an adverse ruling in connection with a non-U.S. tax litigation matter, as well as state taxes. \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nOur effective income tax rate was 17.5% for 2021 compared with 14.7% for 2020. Relative to the 21% statutory rate, the 2021 effective tax rate benefited from investment tax credits, partially offset by incremental tax reserves incurred as a result of an adverse ruling in connection with a non-U.S. tax litigation matter, as well as state taxes. The 2020 effective rate, relative to the 21% statutory rate, benefited from investment tax credits and the benefit of employee share-based payments, partially offset by state taxes. \n\nNet Income Attributable to The Hershey Company and Earnings Per Share-diluted \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nNet income increased $167.3 million, or 11.3%, while EPS-diluted increased $0.85, or 12.0%, in 2022 compared with 2021. The increase in both net income and EPS-diluted was driven primarily by higher gross profit and lower income taxes, partially offset by higher SM&#38;A expenses and higher other income and expenses. Our 2022 EPS-diluted also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our Board-approved repurchase programs. \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nNet income increased $198.8 million, or 15.5%, while EPS-diluted increased $1.00, or 16.4%, in 2021 compared with 2020. The increase in both net income and EPS-diluted was driven primarily by higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SM&#38;A and higher income taxes in 2021. Our 2021 EPS-diluted also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our Board-approved repurchase programs. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 26 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSEGMENT RESULTS \n\nThe summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three segments: North America Confectionery, North America Salty Snacks and International. For segment reporting purposes, we use &#8220;segment income&#8221; to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. These items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation. Segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations. \n\nOur segment results, including a reconciliation to our consolidated results, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 In millions of dollars Net Sales: North America Confectionery $ 8,536.5 $ 7,682.4 $ 7,084.9 North America Salty Snacks 1,029.4 555.4 438.2 International 853.4 733.5 626.6 Total $ 10,419.3 $ 8,971.3 $ 8,149.7 Segment Income: North America Confectionery $ 2,811.1 $ 2,475.9 $ 2,274.6 North America Salty Snacks 159.9 100.7 75.8 International 107.9 74.2 &#8212; Total segment income 3,078.9 2,650.8 2,350.4 Unallocated corporate expense (1) 735.5 614.9 520.7 Unallocated mark-to-market losses (gains) on commodity derivatives (2) 78.2 (24.4) 6.4 Long-lived asset impairment charges &#8212; &#8212; 9.1 Costs associated with business realignment activities 4.4 16.6 31.5 Operating profit 2,260.8 2,043.7 1,782.7 Interest expense, net 137.6 127.4 149.4 Other (income) expense, net 206.2 119.1 138.3 Income before income taxes $ 1,917.0 $ 1,797.2 $ 1,495.0 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (d) acquisition-related costs and (e) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance. \n\n(2) Net losses (gains) on mark-to-market valuation of commodity derivative positions recognized in unallocated derivative losses (gains).

This includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines.

The increase was primarily driven by an increase in acquisition and integration related costs, as well as higher compensation costs, investments in capabilities and technology and broad-based marketplace inflation. \n\nUnallocated corporate expense totaled $614.9 million in 2021 as compared to $520.7 million in 2020 primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, higher group insurance costs from COVID-19-related delays in preventive care and incremental investments in capabilities and technology. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial amounts of cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment, strategic acquisitions and the payment of dividends. \n\nCash Flow Summary \n\nThe following table is derived from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: \n\n##TABLE_START In millions of dollars 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,327.8 $ 2,082.9 $ 1,699.6 Investing activities (787.4) (2,222.8) (531.3) Financing activities (1,415.7) (681.1) (499.2) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 9.9 (5.1) (7.0) Less: Cash classified as assets held for sale &#8212; 11.4 (11.4) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 134.6 $ (814.7) $ 650.7 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating activities \n\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. We meet these needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper. \n\nWe generated cash of $2.3 billion from operating activities in 2022, an increase of $244.9 million compared to $2.1 billion in 2021. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors: \n\n&#8226; In the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, consumed cash of $9 million in 2022 and generated cash of $47 million in 2021. This $56 million fluctuation was mainly driven by a higher year-over-year build up of U.S. inventories to satisfy product requirements and maintain sufficient levels to accommodate customer requirements, partially offset by the timing of vendor and supplier payments. \n\n&#8226; Net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, write-down of equity investments and other charges) resulted in $348 million of higher cash flow in 2022 relative to 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 31 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe generated cash of $2.1 billion from operating activities in 2021, an increase of $383.3 million compared to $1.7 billion in 2020. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors: \n\n&#8226; In the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, generated cash of $47 million in 2021 and consumed cash of $166 million in 2020. This $213 million fluctuation was mainly driven by strong demand of U.S. inventories, specifically our everyday core U.S. confection brands and salty snack brands. \n\n&#8226; Net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, long-lived asset charges, write-down of equity investments and other charges) resulted in $185 million of higher cash flow in 2021 relative to 2020. \n\nPension and Post-Retirement Activity. We recorded net periodic benefit costs of $36.3 million, $28.4 million and $34.5 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans). The main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value plan obligations, expected returns on plan assets, the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses. \n\nThe funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. We contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. Cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled $78.5 million, $51.1 million and $11.7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nInvesting activities \n\nOur principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, as well as acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. We used cash of $787.4 million for investing activities in 2022 compared to $2.2 billion in 2021, with the decrease in cash spend driven by lower levels of acquisition activity, partially offset by higher capital spend and investment tax credits. We used cash of $531.3 million for investing activities in 2020, with the increase in 2021 in cash spend driven by higher levels acquisition activity. \n\nPrimary investing activities include the following: \n\n&#8226; Capital spending . Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, primarily to support our ERP system implementation, capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $519.5 million in 2022, $495.9 million in 2021 and $441.6 million in 2020. For each of the years presented, our expenditures increased due to progress on capacity expansion projects and our ERP system implementation. We expect 2023 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, to approximate $800 million to $900 million. The increase in our 2023 capital expenditures is largely driven by our key strategic initiatives, including core confection capacity expansion and continued investments in a digital infrastructure including the build and upgrade of a new ERP system across the enterprise. We intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds to meet our 2023 capital requirements. \n\n&#8226; Investments in partnerships qualifying for tax credits . We make investments in partnership entities that in turn make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits. We invested approximately $275.5 million in 2022, $128.4 million in 2021 and $87.2 million in 2020 in projects qualifying for tax credits. \n\n&#8226; Business acquisitions . In 2022 and 2020, we had no acquisition activity. In 2021, we spent an aggregate $1.6 billion to acquire Lily's (June 2021), as well as Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels (December 2021). Further details regarding our business acquisition activity is provided in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#8226; Other investing activities . In 2022, 2021, and 2020, our other investing activities were minimal. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 32 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFinancing activities \n\nOur cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our Common Stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Financing activities in 2022 used cash of $1.4 billion, compared to cash used of $681.1 million in 2021. We used cash of $499.2 million for financing activities in 2020. \n\nThe majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following: \n\n&#8226; Short-term borrowings, net. In addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. In 2022, used cash of $245.6 million to reduce a portion of our short-term commercial paper borrowings originally used to fund our 2021 acquisitions of Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels, partially offset by an increase in short-term foreign bank borrowings. In 2021, we generated cash flow of $869.0 million predominantly through the issuance of short-term commercial paper. In 2020, we generated cash flow of $41.8 million due to an increase in short-term foreign bank borrowings. \n\n&#8226; Long-term debt borrowings and repayments . In 2022, long-term debt activity was minimal. In February 2021 and May 2021, we repaid $84.7 million of 8.800% Debentures and $350 million of 3.100% Notes due upon their maturities, respectively. In May 2020, we issued $300 million of 0.900% Notes due in 2025, $350 million of 1.700% Notes due in 2030 and $350 million of 2.650% Notes due in 2050 (the &#8220;2020 Notes&#8221;). Proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 Notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, totaled $989.9 million. Additionally, in May 2020 and December 2020, we repaid $350 million of 2.900% Notes and $350 million of 4.125% Notes due upon their maturities, respectively. In 2023, we expect our long-term debt repayments to approximate $750 million upon the maturity of $250 million of 2.625% Notes and $500 million of 3.375% Notes, both due in May 2023. \n\n&#8226; Dividend payments . Total dividend payments to holders of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock were $775.0 million in 2022, $686.0 million in 2021 and $640.7 million in 2020. Dividends per share of Common Stock increased 13.6% to $3.874 per share in 2022 compared to $3.410 per share in 2021, while dividends per share of Class B Common Stock increased 13.6% in 2022. Details regarding our 2022 cash dividends paid to stockholders are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Quarter Ended In millions of dollars except per share amounts April 3, 2022 July 3, 2022 October 2, 2022 December 31, 2022 Dividends paid per share &#8211; Common stock $ 0.901 $ 0.901 $ 1.036 $ 1.036 Dividends paid per share &#8211; Class B common stock $ 0.819 $ 0.819 $ 0.942 $ 0.942 Total cash dividends paid $ 181.1 $ 179.9 $ 207.0 $ 207.0 Declaration date February 2, 2022 April 27, 2022 July 27, 2022 November 2, 2022 Record date February 18, 2022 May 20, 2022 August 19, 2022 November 18, 2022 Payment date March 15, 2022 June 15, 2022 September 15, 2022 December 15, 2022 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 33 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8226; Share repurchases . We repurchase shares of Common Stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans. The value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price. In addition, we periodically repurchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to Board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value. Details regarding our share repurchases are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START In millions 2022 2021 2020 Milton Hershey School Trust repurchase (1) $ 203.4 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Shares repurchased in the open market under pre-approved share repurchase programs (2) &#8212; 150.0 150.0 Shares repurchased in the open market to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options and incentive compensation $ 185.6 $ 308.0 $ 61.2 Cash used for total share repurchases 389.0 458.0 211.2 Total shares repurchased under pre-approved share repurchase programs &#8212; 0.9 1.0 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) In February 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock from the School Trust at a price equal to $203.35 per share, for a total purchase price of $203.4 million. \n\n(2) In July 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase authorization. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $110 million remained available for repurchases of our Common Stock under this program. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. This program is to commence after the existing 2018 authorization is completed and is to be utilized at management&#8217;s discretion. These share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date. We expect 2023 share repurchases to be in line with our traditional buyback strategy. \n\nAdditionally, in February 2023, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock from the School Trust at a price equal to $239.91 per share, for a total purchase price of $239.9 million. As a result of this repurchase, our July 2018 share repurchase authorization program was completed in February 2023, and approximately $370 million remains available for repurchases under our May 2021 share repurchase authorization. \n\n&#8226; Proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including tax benefits. In 2022 we received $34.2 million from employee exercises of stock options and paid $35.5 million of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards. We received $33.2 million and $25.5 million from employee exercises of stock options, net of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 34 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFinancial Condition \n\nAt December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $463.9 million. At December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $329.3 million. Our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2022 increased $134.6 million compared to the 2021 year-end balance as a result of the net sources of cash outlined in the previous discussion. \n\nApproximately 90% of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the United States. A majority of this balance is distributable to the United States without material tax implications, such as withholding tax. We intend to continue to reinvest the remainder of the earnings outside of the United States for which there would be a material tax implication to distributing for the foreseeable future and, therefore, have not recognized additional tax expense on these earnings. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short- and long-term cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. \n\nWe maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders&#8217; equity. Our total short- and long-term debt was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Our total debt decreased in 2022 mainly due the repayment of short-term commercial paper borrowings originally used to fund our 2021 acquisitions of Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels. \n\nAs a source of short-term financing, we maintain a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional $500 million with the consent of the lenders. As of December 31, 2022, the termination date of this agreement is July 2, 2024, however, we may extend the termination date for up to two additional one-year periods upon notice to the administrative agent under the facility. We may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, we had $942 million of available capacity under the agreement. The unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties and events of default. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022. \n\nIn addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks. As of December 31, 2022, we had available capacity of $178 million under these lines of credit. \n\nFurthermore, we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements, including reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements. \n\nOur ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit rating. \n\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short- and long-term cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 35 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nEquity Structure \n\nWe have two classes of stock outstanding &#8211; Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of the Common Stock have 1 vote per share. Holders of the Class B Stock have 10 votes per share. Holders of the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our Board. With respect to dividend rights, holders of the Common Stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock. \n\nHershey Trust Company, as trustee for the trust established by Milton S. and Catherine S. Hershey that has as its sole beneficiary Milton Hershey School, maintains voting control over The Hershey Company. In addition, three representatives of Hershey Trust Company currently serve as members of the Company's Board. In performing their responsibilities on the Company&#8217;s Board, these representatives may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our Board or management. Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Trust, in its role as controlling stockholder of the Company, has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in The Hershey Company. The Company&#8217;s Board, and not the Hershey Trust Company board, is solely responsible and accountable for the Company&#8217;s management and performance. \n\nPennsylvania law requires that the Office of Attorney General be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Trust, no longer having voting control of the Company. The law provides specific statutory authority for the Attorney General to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Trust, to stop such a transaction if the Attorney General can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the Company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. This legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. \n\nMaterial Cash Requirements \n\nThe following table summarizes our future material cash requirements as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Payments due by Period In millions of dollars Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Short-term debt (primarily U.S. commercial paper) $ 693.8 $ 693.8 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Long-term notes (excluding finance lease obligations) 4,043.6 750.0 900.0 693.6 1,700.0 Interest expense (1) 1,080.8 99.0 164.3 120.2 697.3 Operating lease obligations (2) 419.7 41.4 66.3 47.4 264.6 Finance lease obligations (3) 171.4 8.3 13.0 8.1 142.0 Unconditional purchase obligations (4) 2,246.4 1,871.0 215.1 25.0 135.3 Total obligations $ 8,655.7 $ 3,463.5 $ 1,358.7 $ 894.3 $ 2,939.2 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed rate debt associated with long-term notes. \n\n(2) Includes the minimum rental commitments (including imputed interest) under non-cancelable operating leases primarily for offices, retail stores, warehouses and distribution facilities. \n\n(3) Includes the minimum rental commitments (including imputed interest) under non-cancelable finance leases primarily for offices and warehouse facilities, as well as vehicles. \n\n(4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business. Amounts presented include fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2022. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at year-end 2022, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. Such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 36 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. Our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. We do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults. \n\nThese obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. To meet those cash requirements, we intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds. To the extent necessary, we may also borrow under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility or under other short-term borrowings, and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular Note maturity or acquisition to our then-available sources of funds, to obtain additional short- and long-term financing. We believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future short- and long-term cash requirements. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\nWe have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. Our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. We do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos. \n\nIncome Tax Obligations \n\nLiabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nInformation on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 37 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: \n\n&#8226; Accrued Liabilities for Trade Promotion Activities \n\n&#8226; Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans \n\n&#8226; Business Acquisitions, Valuation and Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\n&#8226; Income Taxes \n\nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board. While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. Other significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAccrued Liabilities for Trade Promotion Activities \n\nWe promote our products with advertising, trade promotions and consumer incentives. These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred. We recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. These estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. During 2022, 2021, and 2020, actual annual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3%. Our trade promotion and consumer incentive accrued liabilities totaled $215.7 million and $174.0 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans \n\nWe sponsor various defined benefit pension plans. The primary plans are The Hershey Company Retirement Plan and The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees, which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2007. We also sponsor two primary other post-employment benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) plans, consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees. The health care plan is contributory, with participants&#8217; contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory. \n\nFor accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management&#8217;s best judgment regarding future expectations. Our related accounting policies, accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPension Plans \n\nChanges in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations: \n\n&#8226; Long-term rate of return on plan assets . The expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. We consider a number of factors when setting assumptions with respect to the long-term rate of return, including current and expected asset allocation and historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories. Actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return estimated using the \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 38 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nlong-term rate of return and the actual return realized. For 2022, we increased the expected return on plan assets assumption to 6.3% from the 4.9% assumption used during 2021. The historical average return (compounded annually) over the 20 years prior to December 31, 2022 was approximately 6.4%. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $213 million. W e amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount, which is the greater of 10% of a respective plan&#8217;s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets. These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the expected long-term rate of investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or (iii) other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience. A 100 basis point decrease or increase in the long-term rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $7 million. \n\n&#8226; Discount rate . We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. This approach does not affect the measurement of our pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping. \n\nA 100 basis point decrease (increase) in the weighted-average pension discount rate would increase (decrease) annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $5 million and the December 31, 2022 pension liability would increase by approximately $57 million or decrease by approximately $50 million, respectively. \n\nPension expense for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately $21 million in 2023. Pension expense beyond 2023 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans. \n\nOther Post-Employment Benefit Plans \n\nChanges in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations: \n\n&#8226; Discount rate . The determination of the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligati ons of the OPEB plans is discussed in the pension plans section above. A 100 basis point decrease (increase) in the discount rate assumption for these plans would not be material to the OPEB plans&#8217; consolidated expense and the December 31, 2022 benefit liability would increase by approximately $13 million or decrease by approximately $12 million, respectively. \n\nBusiness Acquisitions, Valuation and Imp airment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. Under the acquisition method, the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. As a result, we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. \n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead, are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 39 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill). We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset. \n\nWe determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses. We believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. \n\nWe also have intangible assets, consisting primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions, that are expected to have determinable useful lives. The costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. We conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finite-lived assets may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets. \n\nResults of Impairment Tests \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the net book value of our goodwill totaled $2.6 billion. As it relates to our 2022 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we tested all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment and determined that no quantitative testing was deemed necessary. Based on our testing, all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over the their respective carrying values. There were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist. We had no goodwill impairment charges in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our Company, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities; a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. We maintain reserves for such assessments. \n\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 40 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. \n\nWe believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. Our valuation allowances are primarily related to U.S. capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions&#8217; net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nWe use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. \n\nWe enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures. We enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods. These commodity derivative instruments are intended to be, and are effective as, economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. \n\nIn entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by entering into exchange-traded contracts with collateral posting requirements and/or by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. \n\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nIn December 2020, our fixed-to-floating interest rate swap matured in connection with the repayment of certain long-term debt upon its maturity. Therefore, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no interest rate swap derivative instruments in a fair value hedging relationship. Prior to maturing in December 2020, the total notional amount of interest rate swaps was $350 million. The notional amount relates to fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps which convert a comparable amount of fixed-rate debt to variable rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variable-rate debt through its December 2020 maturity would have increased interest expense by approximately $3.2 million for 2020. \n\nIn addition, the total amount of short-term debt, net of cash, amounted to net debt of $230 million and net debt of $610 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variable-rate short-term debt as of December 31, 2022 would have changed interest expense by approximately $4.5 million for 2022 and $2.4 million for 2021. \n\nWe consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio, excluding fixed-rate debt converted to variable rates with fixed-to-floating instruments, to be minimal since this debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 by approximately $187 million and $319 million, respectively. However, since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 41 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \n\nWe are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment, raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies. We also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the United States. We generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 12 months. \n\nA summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Contract Amount Primary Currencies Contract Amount Primary Currencies In millions of dollars \n\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase foreign currencies $ 58.3 Euros Malaysian ringgit $ 53.1 Euros Malaysian ringgit British pound Foreign currency forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies $ 119.6 Canadian dollars Brazilian reals Japanese yen Mexican Pesos $ 144.7 Canadian dollars Brazilian reals Japanese yen ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net fair value of these instruments was an asset of $3.9 million and an asset of $2.8 million, respectively. In addition, assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year-end foreign currency exchange rates, the fair value of these instruments would have declined by $18.4 million and $24.8 million, respectively, generally offset by a reduction in foreign exchange associated with our transactional activities. \n\nCommodities&#8212;Price Risk Management and Futures Contracts \n\nOur most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products, sugar, corn products, dairy products, wheat, peanuts and almonds. The cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors. These factors include: \n\n&#8226; Commodity market fluctuations; \n\n&#8226; Currency exchanges rates; \n\n&#8226; Imbalances between supply and demand; \n\n&#8226; Rising levels of inflation and interest rates related to domestic and global economic conditions or supply chain issues; \n\n&#8226; The effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality; \n\n&#8226; Speculative influences; \n\n&#8226; Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations; \n\n&#8226; Supplier compliance with commitments; \n\n&#8226; Import/export requirements for raw materials and finished goods; \n\n&#8226; Political unrest in producing countries; \n\n&#8226; Introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements; \n\n&#8226; Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies; and \n\n&#8226; Other events beyond our control such as the impacts on the business or supply chain arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 42 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products, sugar, corn products, certain dairy products, wheat products, natural gas and diesel fuel primarily to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs within our supply chain. Currently, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements, primarily peanuts and almonds. We attempt to minimize the effect of future raw material and energy price fluctuations by using derivatives and forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months. However, dairy futures liquidity is not as developed as many of the other commodity futures markets and, therefore, it can be difficult to hedge dairy costs for extended periods of time. We use diesel fuel futures to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases. Our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices. \n\nCocoa Products \n\nDuring 2022, average cocoa futures contract prices decreased 0.9% compared with 2021 and continued to trade in a narrow range between $1.06 and $1.22 per pound, based on the Intercontinental Exchange futures contract. Production was down significantly in Ghana by nearly 30%, while it was stable in the rest of West Africa. As consumption remained strong, the large surplus in the 2020 - 2021 season became a small deficit in the 2022 season. The global surplus of the 2020 - 2021 season weighed on the price outlook for the first half of 2022 and the futures market corrected to accommodate the Living Income Differential being imposed by the Ghana and Ivory Coast cocoa marketing boards, leading to fairly similar price levels to the previous year. The table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated. The prices reflect the monthly averages of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the Intercontinental Exchange. \n\n##TABLE_START Cocoa Futures Contract Prices (dollars per pound) 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Annual Average $ 1.13 $ 1.14 $ 1.11 $ 1.03 $ 1.06 High 1.22 1.27 1.29 1.14 1.23 Low 1.06 1.04 1.00 0.90 0.88 ##TABLE_END\n\nSource: International Cocoa Organization Quarterly Bulletin of Cocoa Statistics \n\nOur costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices, premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times, and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder. As a result, the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs. \n\nSugar \n\nThe price of sugar is subject to price supports under U.S. farm legislation. Such legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar. As a result, sugar prices paid by users in the U.S. are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market. The U.S. delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range from $0.53 to $0.71 per pound during 2022. Prices were historically high throughout 2022 due to lack of imports by the U.S. government resulting in an extremely tight domestic raw sugar market and strong demand which resulted in a scarcity market for much of the year. \n\nCorn Products \n\nWe use corn futures to price our corn sweetener product requirements. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine caused a tightness for global grain stocks in 2022. Corn prices traded in a range from $5.62 to $8.25 per bushel during 2022. Corn sweetener prices were also higher as strong demand resulted in a scarcity market during the year. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 43 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nDairy Products \n\nDuring 2022 prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of $0.23 per pound to a high of $0.26 per pound, on a Class IV milk basis. Fluid dairy milk prices were higher than 2021, driven by declines in U.S. milk production and higher global dairy demand. \n\nWheat Products \n\nIn 2022 we continued utilizing soft and hard wheat futures as a risk management tool for our flour purchasing. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in addition to poor U.S. weather, resulted in uncertainty in the wheat market and impacted global availability of supplies. Wheat stock levels were at historic 15-year lows and prices reached historic highs in 2022. Hard wheat prices traded in the range of $7.72 to $13.21 per bushel during 2022, while soft wheat prices traded in the range of $7.40 to $12.29 per bushel during 2022. \n\nPeanuts and Almonds \n\nPeanut prices in the U.S. ranged from a low of $0.55 per pound to a high of $0.64 per pound during 2022. Prices rose this year due to higher competing crop prices and a smaller peanut crop. Almond prices traded in the range of $2.00 per pound to $2.25 per pound during 2022. Prices were lower than 2021 as a result of large crop and high inventory levels. \n\nChanges in the Value of Futures Contracts \n\nWe make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange or various other exchanges. These changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses. The cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs. \n\nCommodity Sensitivity Analysis \n\nOur open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $243.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and $313.2 million as of December 31, 2021. At the end of 2022, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2022 by $25.1 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 44 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 46 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Valuation of Accrued Liabilities for Trade Promotion Activities Description of the Matter The unsettled portion of the Company&#8217;s obligation for trade promotion activities at December 31, 2022 was $215.7 million. As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company promotes its products through programs such as, but not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, and volume-based incentives. The Company recognizes the estimated costs of these trade promotion activities as a component of variable consideration when determining the transaction price. The unsettled portion of the Company&#8217;s obligation for trade promotion activities is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. \n\nAuditing management&#8217;s calculation of the unsettled portion of the Company&#8217;s obligation for trade promotion activities was highly subjective and required significant judgment as a result of the nature of the required estimates and assumptions. In particular, the estimates required an analysis of the programs offered, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, historical sales and payment trends, and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past. The estimated cost of these programs is sensitive to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls related to the Company&#8217;s calculation of the accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities. For example, we tested controls over management&#8217;s review of the completeness of the promotional activities as well as the significant assumptions and the data inputs utilized in the calculations. \n\nTo test the unsettled portion of the Company&#8217;s obligation for trade promotion activities, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing (1) the expected value estimation methodology used by management, (2) whether all material trade promotion activities were properly included in management&#8217;s estimate, and (3) the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used in its analyses. Specifically, when evaluating the significant assumptions, we compared them to historical trends, third party data, and assumptions used in prior periods, and inspected management&#8217;s retrospective review of actual trade promotion activities compared to previous estimates. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the estimate that would result from changes in the assumptions. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n/s/ ERNST &#38; YOUNG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2016. \n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania \n\nFebruary 17, 2023 ##TABLE_END . \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 47 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Hershey Company \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited The Hershey Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Hershey Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 48 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n/s/ ERNST &#38;

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nDescription of Business \n\nThe Hershey Company together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which it has a controlling interest, (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Hershey,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a global confectionery leader known for its branded portfolio of chocolate, sweets, mints and other great tasting snacks. The Company has more than 100 brands worldwide including such iconic brand names as Hershey&#8217;s, Reese&#8217;s, Kisses, Jolly Rancher and Ice Breakers, which are marketed, sold and distributed in approximately 80 countries worldwide. Hershey&#8217;s structure is designed to ensure continued focus on North America, coupled with an emphasis on profitable growth in our focus international markets. The Company currently operates through three segments that are aligned with its management structure and the key markets it serves: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International. For additional information on our segment presentation, see Note 13 . \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Hershey Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. We have a controlling financial interest if we own a majority of the outstanding voting common stock and minority shareholders do not have substantive participating rights, we have significant control through contractual or economic interests in which we are the primary beneficiary or we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We use the equity method of accounting when we have a 20% to 50% interest in other companies and exercise significant influence. In addition, we use the equity method of accounting for our investments in partnership entities which make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits. See Note 10 for additional information on our equity investments in partnership entities qualifying for tax credits. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are included as Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, see Note 8 . \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Our significant estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, marketing and trade promotion accruals and income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on management&#8217;s best judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and the effects of any revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period that they are determined. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe majority of our revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer orders for the purchase of our products, including chocolate, sweets, mints and other grocery and snack offerings. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for these contracts based on our selling list price which is then reduced by estimated costs for trade promotional programs, consumer incentives, and allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsaleable products. We recognize revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product(s) is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon delivery to the customer or other customer-designated delivery point. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis. \n\nOur trade promotional programs and consumer incentives are used to promote our products and include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, and volume-based incentives. The estimated costs \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 55 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nassociated with these programs and incentives are based upon our analysis of the programs offered, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, historical sales and payment trends, and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3 %. The Company&#8217;s unsettled portion remaining in accrued liabilities at year-end for these activities was $ 215,688 and $ 174,046 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nWe also recognize a minor amount of royalty income (less than 1% of our consolidated net sales) from sales-based licensing arrangements, pursuant to which revenue is recognized as the third-party licensee sales occur. Shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver product to the customer are recorded within cost of sales. Sales, value add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. \n\nThe majority of our products are confectionery or confectionery-based and, therefore, exhibit similar economic characteristics, as they are based on similar ingredients and are marketed and sold through the same channels to the same customers. In connection with our recent acquisitions, we have expanded our portfolio of salty snacking products, which also exhibit similar economic characteristics to our confectionery products and are sold through the same channels to the same customers. See Note 13 for revenues reported by geographic segment, which is consistent with how we organize and manage our operations, as well as product line net sales information. \n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 28 %, 30 % and 31 %, respectively, of our consolidated net sales were made to McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. \n\nCost of Sales \n\nCost of sales represents costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of our products. Primary costs include raw materials, packaging, direct labor, overhead, shipping and handling, warehousing and the depreciation of manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities. Manufacturing overhead and related expenses include salaries, wages, employee benefits, utilities, maintenance and property taxes. \n\nSelling, Marketing and Administrative Expense \n\nSelling, marketing and administrative expense (&#8220;SM&#38;A&#8221;) represents costs incurred in generating revenues and in managing our business. Such costs include advertising and other marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of capitalized software and intangible assets and depreciation of administrative facilities. &#160; Research and development costs, charged to expense as incurred, totaled $ 46,943 in 2022, $ 40,107 in 2021 and $ 37,577 in 2020. Advertising expense is also charged to expense as incurred and totaled $ 517,677 in 2022, $ 511,798 in 2021 and $ 516,936 in 2020. Prepaid advertising expense was $ 241 as of December 31, 2022. There was no prepaid advertising expense as of December 31, 2021. \n\nCash Equivalents \n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments, time deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less. The fair value of cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount. \n\nAccounts Receivable&#8212;Trade \n\nIn the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria, based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of current and projected economic conditions. Our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with McLane Company, Inc., one customer served principally by our North America Confectionery segment. As of December 31, 2022, McLane Company, Inc. accounted for approximately 26 % of our total accounts receivable. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our year-end accounts receivable. We believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base. Accounts receivable-trade in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is presented net of allowances for bad debts and anticipated discounts of $ 26,001 and $ 28,837 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 56 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nInventories \n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value, adjusted for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise unsaleable. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 53 % of our inventories, representing the majority of our United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) inventories, were valued under the last-in, first-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;) method. The remainder of our inventories in the U.S. and inventories for our international businesses were valued at the lower of first-in, first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;), average cost or net realizable value. LIFO cost of inventories valued using the LIFO method was $ 621,614 as of December 31, 2022 and $ 589,850 as of December 31, 2021. The adjustment to LIFO, as shown in Note 1 9 , approximates the excess of replacement cost over the stated LIFO inventory value. The net impact of LIFO acquisitions and liquidations was not material to 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment; and 25 to 40 years for buildings and related improvements. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, property, plant and equipment included assets under finance lease arrangements with net book values totaling $ 72,160 and $ 72,496 , respectively. Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 253,582 , $ 230,638 and $ 219,021 , respectively, and included depreciation on assets recorded under finance lease arrangements. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. We capitalize applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of new facilities and production lines and amortize these costs over the assets&#8217; estimated useful lives. \n\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. If these assets are considered to be impaired, we measure impairment as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. We report assets held for sale or disposal at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. \n\nWe assess asset retirement obligations on a periodic basis and recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We capitalize associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. \n\nComputer Software \n\nWe capitalize costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable the software being developed will be completed and placed in service. Capitalized costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software, (ii) payroll and other related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal-use software project and (iii) interest costs incurred, when material, while developing internal-use software. We cease capitalization of such costs no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. \n\nThe unamortized amount of capitalized software totaled $ 320,034 and $ 260,656 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We amortize software costs using the straight-line method over the expected life of the software, generally 3 to 7 years. Accumulated amortization of capitalized software was $ 350,620 and $ 321,939 as of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Such amounts are recorded within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nWe review the carrying value of software and development costs for impairment in accordance with our policy pertaining to the impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 57 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nrequired. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill). We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset. \n\nWe determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses. We believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. \n\nThe cost of intangible assets with finite useful lives is amortized on a straight-line basis. Our finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions. The weighted-average amortization period for our finite-lived intangible assets is approximately 29 years , which is primarily driven by recently acquired trademarks. If certain events or changes in operating conditions indicate that the carrying value of these assets, or related asset groups, may not be recoverable, we perform an impairment assessment and may adjust the remaining useful lives. See Note 3 for additional information regarding the results of impairment tests. \n\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations \n\nDuring 2020, we entered into an agreement with a third-party financial institution to facilitate a supplier finance program which allows qualifying suppliers to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institution. These participating suppliers negotiate their outstanding receivable arrangements directly with the financial institution, and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted. We have no economic interest in a supplier&#8217;s decision to enter into these agreements. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the supplier finance program and reaches an agreement with a financial institution, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the financial institution. However, all Company payments to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. The financial institution pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold under the supplier finance program. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted by our suppliers&#8217; decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Included in Accounts Payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 105,293 and $ 36,386 of outstanding payment obligations, respectively, that were sold to the financial institution under the Company&#8217;s supplier finance program. \n\nCurrency Translation \n\nThe financial statements of our foreign entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars, with the resulting translation adjustments recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rates during the period. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 58 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to offset exposure to market risks arising from changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. See Note 5 for additional information on our risk management strategy and the types of instruments we use. \n\nDerivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When we become party to a derivative instrument and intend to apply hedge accounting, we designate the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a cash flow or fair value hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value (gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether we have designated it and it qualified as part of a hedging relationship, as noted below: \n\n&#8226; Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) to the extent effective and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the transaction hedged by that derivative also affects earnings. \n\n&#8226; Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge, along with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the risk being hedged, are recorded in earnings, thereby reflecting in earnings the net extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. \n\n&#8226; Changes in the fair value of a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument are recognized in earnings in cost of sales or SM&#38;A, consistent with the related exposure. \n\nFor derivatives designated as hedges, we assess, both at the hedge&#8217;s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether they are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The ineffective portion, if any, is recorded directly in earnings. In addition, if we determine that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. \n\nWe do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. \n\nCash flows related to the derivative instruments we use to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This ASU modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all periods presented. We adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2020. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . This ASU modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. We adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2020. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract .

ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . This ASU is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and clarifying certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. Most amendments within this ASU are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We adopted the provisions of this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . The ASU is intended to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. Entities may apply this ASU upon issuance through December 31, 2022 on a prospective basis. We early adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2022. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities&#8212;Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): \n\nDisclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations . This ASU requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the program including the program&#8217;s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude. ASU 2022-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those annual periods. A rollforward of obligations during the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid, is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 with early adoption permitted. This ASU should be applied retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. We early adopted provisions of this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the exception of the amendment on rollforward information, which will be adopted in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those annual periods. This ASU should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the date of adoption. Evaluation of this new standard is dependent on multiple circumstances including the timing and complexity of completed business combinations. As a result, we intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nNo other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 60 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\n2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES \n\nAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for as business combinations and, accordingly, the results of operations of the businesses acquired have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions. The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. \n\nIn conjunction with acquisitions noted below, we used various valuation techniques to determine fair value of the assets acquired, with the primary techniques being discounted cash flow analysis, relief-from-royalty, a form of the multi-period excess earnings and the with-and-without valuation approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Inputs to these valuation approaches require significant judgment including: (i) forecasted sales, growth rates and customer attrition rates, (ii) forecasted operating margins, (iii) royalty rates and discount rates used to present value future cash flows, (iv) the amount of synergies expected from the acquisition, (v) the economic useful life of assets and (vi) the evaluation of historical tax positions. In certain acquisitions, historical data is limited, therefore, we base our estimates and assumptions on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. \n\n2021 Activity \n\nPretzels Inc. \n\nOn December 14, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pretzels Inc. (&#8220;Pretzels&#8221;), previously a privately held company that manufactures and sells pretzels and other salty snacks for other branded products and private labels in the United States. Pretzels is an industry leader in the pretzel category with a product portfolio that includes filled, gluten free and seasoned pretzels, as well as extruded snacks that complements Hershey&#8217;s snacks portfolio. Based in Bluffton, Indiana, Pretzels operates three manufacturing locations in Indiana and Kansas. Pretzels provides Hershey with deep pretzel category and product expertise and the manufacturing capabilities to support brand growth and future pretzel innovation. The cash consideration paid for Pretzels totaled $ 304,334 and consisted of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Acquisition-related costs for the Pretzels acquisition were immaterial. \n\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Pretzels has been included within the North America Salty Snacks segment from the date of acquisition. The purchase consideration was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Goodwill $ 166,191 &#160; Other intangible assets 26,100 &#160; Current assets acquired 30,835 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net 100,716 &#160; Other non-current assets, primarily operating lease ROU assets 111,787 &#160; Deferred income taxes 773 &#160; Current liabilities acquired ( 22,713 ) Other long-term liabilities, primarily operating lease liabilities ( 109,355 ) Net assets acquired $ 304,334 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe purchase price allocation presented above has been finalized as of the third quarter of 2022 and includes an immaterial amount of measurement period adjustments. The measurement period adjustments to the initial allocation were based on more detailed information obtained about the specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed, specifically, post-closing adjustments to the working capital acquired including certain holdbacks. \n\nGoodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (including the identifiable intangible assets). A portion of goodwill derived from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our brand building expertise, supply chain capabilities and retail relationships to accelerate growth and access to the portfolio of Pretzels&#8217; products. \n\nOther intangible assets include trademarks valued at $ 5,700 and customer relationships valued at $ 20,400 . Trademarks were assigned an estimated useful life of five years and customer relationships were assigned an estimated useful life of 19 years. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 61 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nDot's Pretzels, LLC \n\nOn December 13, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Dot&#8217;s Pretzels, LLC (&#8220;Dot&#8217;s&#8221;), previously a privately held company that produces and sells pretzels and other snack food products to retailers and distributors in the United States, with Dot&#8217;s Homestyle Pretzels snacks as its primary product. Dot&#8217;s is the fastest-growing scale brand in the pretzel category and complements Hershey&#8217;s snacks portfolio. The cash consideration paid for Dot&#8217;s totaled $ 891,169 and consisted of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Acquisition-related costs for the Dot&#8217;s acquisition were immaterial. \n\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Dot&#8217;s has been included within the North America Salty Snacks segment from the date of acquisition.

The measurement period adjustments to the initial allocation were based on more detailed information obtained about the specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed, specifically, the refinement of certain assumptions in the value of customer relationships based on an analysis of historical customer-specific data and post-closing adjustments to the working capital acquired including certain holdbacks. \n\nGoodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (including the identifiable intangible assets). The goodwill derived from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our brand building expertise, supply chain capabilities and retail relationships to accelerate growth and access to the portfolio of Dot&#8217;s products. \n\nOther intangible assets include trademarks valued at $ 336,600 and customer relationships valued at $ 206,500 . Trademarks were assigned an estimated useful life of 33 years and customer relationships were assigned estimated useful life of 18 years. \n\nLily's Sweets, LLC \n\nOn June 25, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Lily&#8217;s Sweets, LLC (&#8220;Lily&#8217;s&#8221;), previously a privately held company that sells a line of sugar-free and low-sugar confectionery foods to retailers and distributors in the United States and Canada. Lily&#8217;s products include dark and milk chocolate style bars, baking chips, peanut butter cups and other confection products that complement Hershey&#8217;s confectionery and confectionery-based portfolio. The cash consideration paid for Lily&#8217;s totaled $ 422,210 and the Company may be required to pay additional cash consideration if certain defined targets related to net sales and gross margin are exceeded during the period from the closing date through December 31, 2021. As of the acquisition date, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation was classified as a liability of $ 5,000 and was determined using a scenario-based analysis on forecasted future results. Based on financial results through December 31, 2021, the fair value was reduced during the fourth quarter of 2021 to $ 1,250 , with the adjustment to fair value recorded in the selling, marketing and administrative (&#8220;SM&#38;A&#8221;) expense caption within the Consolidated Statements of Income. We paid this contingent consideration during the second quarter of 2022. Acquisition-related costs for the Lily&#8217;s acquisition were immaterial. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 62 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Lily&#8217;s has been included within the North America Confectionery segment from the date of acquisition.

The majority of goodwill derived from this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our brand building expertise, supply chain capabilities and retail relationships to accelerate growth and access to the portfolio of Lily&#8217;s products. \n\nOther intangible assets include trademarks valued at $ 151,600 and customer relationships valued at $ 84,200 . Trademarks were assigned an estimated useful life of 33 years and customer relationships were assigned estimated useful lives ranging from 17 to 18 years. \n\nLotte Shanghai Foods Co., Ltd. \n\nIn January 2021, we completed the divestiture of Lotte Shanghai Foods Co., Ltd. (&#8220;LSFC&#8221;), which was previously included within the International segment results in our consolidated financial statements. Total proceeds from the divestiture and the impact on our consolidated financial statements were immaterial and were recorded in the SM&#38;A expense caption within the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\n2020 Activity \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we completed the divestitures of KRAVE Pure Foods, Inc.

SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT \n\nShort-term Debt \n\nAs a source of short-term financing, we utilize cash on hand and commercial paper or bank loans with an original maturity of three months or less. We maintain a $ 1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional $ 500 million with the consent of the lenders. This facility is scheduled to expire \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 64 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\non July 2, 2024; however, we may extend the termination date for up to two additional one-year periods upon notice to the administrative agent under the facility. \n\nThe unsecured committed revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant whereby the ratio of (a) pre-tax income from operations from the most recent four fiscal quarters to (b) consolidated interest expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter. The credit agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and events of default. Payment of outstanding advances may be accelerated, at the option of the lenders, should we default in our obligation under the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we are in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants and the financial covenant pertaining to our credit agreement. There were no significant compensating balance agreements that legally restricted these funds. \n\nIn addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks. Our credit limit in various currencies was $ 313,195 at December 31, 2022 and $ 280,650 at December 31, 2021. These lines permit us to borrow at the respective banks&#8217; prime commercial interest rates, or lower. Commitment fees relating to our revolving credit facility and lines of credit are not material. Short-term debt consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Short-term foreign bank borrowings against lines of credit $ 135,555 $ 119,038 U.S. commercial paper 558,235 820,385 Total short-term debt $ 693,790 $ 939,423 Weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper 4.3 &#160; % 0.1 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nThe maximum amount of short-term borrowings outstanding during 2022 and 2021 was $ 937,593 and $ 939,423 , respectively.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS \n\nWe are exposed to market risks arising principally from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We use certain derivative instruments to manage these risks. These include interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk, foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, and commodities futures and options contracts to manage commodity market price risk exposures. \n\nIn entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by entering into exchanged-traded contracts with collateral posting requirements and/or by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. \n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nWe enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments to reduce the effect of future price fluctuations associated with the purchase of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation services. We generally hedge commodity price risks for 3 - to 24 -month periods. Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $ 243,009 as of December 31, 2022 and $ 313,200 as of December 31, 2021. \n\nDerivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded as incurred within cost of sales. As discussed in Note 13 , we define our segment income to exclude gains and losses on commodity derivatives until the related inventory is sold, at which time the related gains and losses are reflected within segment income. This enables us to continue to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 66 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nForeign Exchange Price Risk \n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and other non-functional currency transactions of certain subsidiaries. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, Brazilian real, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Swiss franc. We typically utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge these exposures for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months. The contracts are either designated as cash flow hedges or are undesignated. The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges was $ 59,448 at December 31, 2022 and $ 94,623 at December 31, 2021. The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $ 1,843 at December 31, 2022 and $ 2,993 at December 31, 2021. The change in fair value on these instruments is recorded directly in cost of sales or selling, marketing and administrative expense, depending on the nature of the underlying exposure. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nIn order to manage interest rate exposure, in previous years we utilized interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. These swaps, which were settled upon issuance of the related debt, were designated as cash flow hedges and the gains and losses that were deferred in other comprehensive income are being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings. \n\nEquity Price Risk \n\nWe are exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices related to our deferred compensation obligations to our employees. To mitigate this risk, we use equity swap contracts to hedge the portion of the exposure that is linked to market-level equity returns. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are entered into for periods of 3 to 12 months. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in SM&#38;A expense, together with the change in the related liabilities. The notional amount of the contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 18,803 and $ 24,975 , respectively. \n\nThe following table presents the classification of derivative assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Assets (1) Liabilities (1) Assets (1) Liabilities (1) Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts $ 3,921 &#160; $ 261 &#160; $ 2,949 &#160; $ 711 &#160; Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Commodities futures and options (2) 685 &#160; 662 &#160; 2,423 &#160; 1,376 &#160; Deferred compensation derivatives 1,222 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,412 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts 246 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 550 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,153 &#160; 662 &#160; 5,385 &#160; 1,376 &#160; Total $ 6,074 &#160; $ 923 &#160; $ 8,334 &#160; $ 2,087 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Derivatives assets are classified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within prepaid expenses and other as well as other non-current assets.

The comparable amounts reflected on a net basis in liabilities at December 31, 2021 were assets of $ 31,774 and liabilities of $ 32,701 . At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the remaining amount reflected in assets and liabilities related to the fair value of other non-exchange traded derivative instruments, respectively. \n\nIncome Statement Impact of Derivative Instruments \n\nThe effect of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Non-designated Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Gains (losses) recognized in income (a) Gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;) Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into income (b) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Commodities futures and options \n\n$ 44,569 &#160; $ 85,402 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts ( 274 ) 547 &#160; 2,056 &#160; ( 1,551 ) 636 &#160; ( 7,145 ) Interest rate swap agreements \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 10,836 ) ( 10,972 ) Deferred compensation derivatives \n\n( 4,920 ) 6,004 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total \n\n$ 39,375 &#160; $ 91,953 &#160; $ 2,056 &#160; $ ( 1,551 ) $ ( 10,200 ) $ ( 18,117 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Gains (losses) recognized in income for non-designated commodities futures and options contracts were included in cost of sales. Gains (losses) recognized in income for non-designated foreign currency forward exchange contracts and deferred compensation derivatives were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. \n\n(b) Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into income for foreign currency forward exchange contracts were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Losses reclassified from AOCI into income for interest rate swap agreements were included in interest expense. \n\nThe amount of pretax net losses on derivative instruments, including interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately $ 7,176 as of December 31, 2022. This amount is primarily associated with interest rate swap agreements. \n\n6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nAccounting guidance on fair value measurements requires that financial assets and liabilities be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories of the fair value hierarchy: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLevel 1 &#8211; Based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. \n\nLevel 2 &#8211; Based on observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. \n\nLevel 3 &#8211; Based on unobservable inputs that reflect the entity&#8217;s own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe did no t have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities, nor were there any transfers between levels during the periods presented. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 68 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Assets (Liabilities) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total December 31, 2022: \n\nDerivative Instruments: Assets: Foreign exchange contracts (1) $ &#8212; &#160; $ 4,167 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 4,167 &#160; Deferred compensation derivatives (2) &#8212; &#160; 1,222 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,222 &#160; Commodities futures and options (3) 685 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 685 &#160; Liabilities: Foreign exchange contracts (1) &#8212; &#160; 261 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 261 &#160; Commodities futures and options (3) 662 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 662 &#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2021: \n\nAssets: Foreign exchange contracts (1) $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,499 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,499 &#160; Deferred compensation derivatives (2) &#8212; &#160; 2,412 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,412 &#160; Commodities futures and options (3) 2,423 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,423 &#160; Liabilities: Foreign exchange contracts (1) &#8212; &#160; 711 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 711 &#160; Commodities futures and options (3) 1,376 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,376 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is the difference between the contract and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. \n\n(2) The fair value of deferred compensation derivatives is based on quoted prices for market interest rates and a broad market equity index. \n\n(3) The fair value of commodities futures and options contracts is based on quoted market prices. \n\nOther Financial Instruments \n\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximated fair values as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. \n\nThe estimated fair value of our long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar debt issuances and is, therefore, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The fair values and carrying values of long-term debt, including the current portion, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Carrying Value At December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Current portion of long-term debt $ 749,345 &#160; $ 2,844 &#160; $ 753,578 &#160; $ 2,844 &#160; Long-term debt 2,854,165 &#160; 4,274,304 &#160; 3,343,977 &#160; 4,086,627 &#160; Total $ 3,603,510 &#160; $ 4,277,148 &#160; $ 4,097,555 &#160; $ 4,089,471 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 69 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nOther Fair Value Measurements \n\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, GAAP requires that, under certain circumstances, we also record assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \n\n2021 Activity \n\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Lily&#8217;s, Dot&#8217;s and Pretzels during 2021, as discussed in Note 2 , we used various valuation techniques to determine fair value, with the primary techniques being discounted cash flow analysis and the relief-from-royalty, a form of the multi-period excess earnings, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. \n\n2020 Activity \n\nDuring 2020, we recorded the following impairment charges, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy: \n\n##TABLE_START 2020 Adjustment to disposal group (1) $ 6,200 &#160; Other asset write-down (2) 2,943 &#160; Long-lived asset impairment charges $ 9,143 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) In connection with the sale of the LSFC joint venture (disposal group previously classified as held for sale), we recorded impairment charges to adjust long-lived asset values. The fair value of the disposal group was supported by potential sales prices with third-party buyers. The sale of the LSFC joint venture was completed in January 2021. \n\n(2) In connection with a previous sale, the Company wrote-down certain receivables deemed uncollectible. \n\n7. LEASES \n\nWe lease office and retail space, warehouse and distribution facilities, land, vehicles, and equipment. We determine if an agreement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. \n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term and are recognized at the lease commencement date. \n\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. \n\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. A limited number of our lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Our lease agreements generally do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. \n\nFor real estate, equipment and vehicles that support selling, marketing and general administrative activities the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. These asset categories comprise the majority of our leases. The lease and non-lease components of real estate and equipment leases supporting production activities are not accounted for as a single lease component. Consideration for such contracts is allocated to the lease component and non-lease components based upon relative standalone prices either observable or estimated if observable prices are not readily available. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 70 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nThe components of lease expense were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Lease expense Classification 2022 2021 Operating lease cost Cost of sales or SM&#38;A (1) $ 48,988 &#160; $ 44,444 &#160; Finance lease cost: Amortization of ROU assets Depreciation and amortization (1) 7,043 &#160; 8,098 &#160; Interest on lease liabilities Interest expense, net 4,192 &#160; 4,358 &#160; Net lease cost (2) $ 60,223 &#160; $ 56,900 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Supply chain-related amounts were included in cost of sales. \n\n(2) Net lease cost does not include short-term leases, variable lease costs or sublease income, all of which are immaterial. \n\nInformation regarding our lease terms and discount rates were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) Operating leases 15.0 15.4 Finance leases 27.7 30.0 Weighted-average discount rate Operating leases 3.2 &#160; % 3.1 &#160; % Finance leases 6.1 &#160; % 6.1 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Leases Classification 2022 2021 Assets Operating lease ROU assets Other non-current assets $ 326,472 &#160; $ 351,712 &#160; Finance lease ROU assets, at cost Property, plant and equipment, gross 86,703 &#160; 89,190 &#160; Accumulated amortization Accumulated depreciation ( 14,543 ) ( 16,694 ) Finance lease ROU assets, net Property, plant and equipment, net 72,160 &#160; 72,496 &#160; Total leased assets $ 398,632 &#160; $ 424,208 &#160; Liabilities Current Operating Accrued liabilities $ 31,787 &#160; $ 36,292 &#160; Finance Current portion of long-term debt 4,285 &#160; 3,564 &#160; Non-current Operating Other long-term liabilities 294,849 &#160; 310,899 &#160; Finance Long-term debt 69,194 &#160; 65,582 &#160; Total lease liabilities $ 400,115 &#160; $ 416,337 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 71 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nThe maturity of our lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Operating leases Finance leases Total 2023 $ 41,393 &#160; $ 8,289 &#160; $ 49,682 &#160; 2024 38,789 &#160; 7,478 &#160; 46,267 &#160; 2025 27,466 &#160; 5,535 &#160; 33,001 &#160; 2026 23,596 &#160; 4,036 &#160; 27,632 &#160; 2027 23,770 &#160; 4,065 &#160; 27,835 &#160; Thereafter 264,553 &#160; 142,020 &#160; 406,573 &#160; Total lease payments 419,567 &#160; 171,423 &#160; 590,990 &#160; Less: Imputed interest 92,931 &#160; 97,944 &#160; 190,875 &#160; Total lease liabilities $ 326,636 &#160; $ 73,479 &#160; $ 400,115 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to leases were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 45,179 &#160; $ 42,584 &#160; Operating cash flows from finance leases $ 4,192 &#160; $ 4,730 &#160; Financing cash flows from finance leases $ 4,717 &#160; $ 4,358 &#160; ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities: Operating leases $ 13,998 &#160; $ 164,951 &#160; Finance leases $ 9,617 &#160; $ ( 6,424 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n8. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES \n\nWe invest in partnerships that make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and renewable energy tax credits. The tax credits, when realized, are recognized as a reduction of tax expense under the flow-through method, at which time the corresponding equity investment is written-down to reflect the remaining value of the future benefits to be realized. The equity investment write-down is reflected within other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 17 ). \n\nAdditionally, we acquire ownership interests in emerging snacking businesses and startup companies, which vary in method of accounting based on our percentage of ownership and ability to exercise significant influence over decisions relating to operating and financial affairs. These investments afford the Company the rights to distribute brands that the Company does not own to third-party customers primarily in North America. Net sales and expenses of our equity method investees are not consolidated into our financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of earnings or losses are recorded on a net basis within other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nBoth equity and cost method investments are reported within other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly review our investments and adjust accordingly for capital contributions, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments. Total investments in unconsolidated affiliates was $ 133,029 and $ 93,089 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\n9. BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES \n\nWe periodically undertake business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business in support of our key growth strategies. Costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 72 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\n##TABLE_START For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cost of sales $ 3 &#160; $ 5,220 &#160; $ 2,209 &#160; Selling, marketing and administrative expense 2,425 &#160; 7,854 &#160; 10,801 &#160; Business realignment costs 1,989 &#160; 3,525 &#160; 18,503 &#160; Costs associated with business realignment activities $ 4,417 &#160; $ 16,599 &#160; $ 31,513 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCosts recorded by program in 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to these activities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 International Optimization Program: Severance and employee benefit costs $ 2,001 &#160; $ 3,982 &#160; $ 18,977 &#160; Other program costs 2,416 &#160; 12,617 &#160; 10,366 &#160; Margin for Growth Program: Severance &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 653 ) Other program costs &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,823 &#160; Total $ 4,417 &#160; $ 16,599 &#160; $ 31,513 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAmounts classified as liabilities qualifying as exit and disposal costs primarily represent employee-related and certain third-party service provider charges, however, such amounts at December 31, 2022 are not significant and are expected to be paid within the next 12 months. \n\n2020 International Optimization Program \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we commenced a program (&#8220;International Optimization Program&#8221;) to streamline resources and investments in select international markets, including the optimization of our China operating model that will improve our operational efficiency and provide for a strong, sustainable and simplified base going forward. \n\nThe International Optimization Program is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, with total pre-tax costs anticipated to be $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 . Cash costs are expected to be $ 40,000 to $ 65,000 , primarily related to workforce reductions of approximately 350 positions outside of the United States, costs to consolidate and relocate production, and third-party costs incurred to execute these activities. The costs and related benefits of the International Optimization Program relate to the International segment. However, segment operating results do not include these business realignment expenses because we evaluate segment performance excluding such costs. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized total costs associated with the International Optimization Program of $ 4,417 and $ 16,599 . These charges predominantly included third-party charges in support of our initiative to transform our China operating model, as well as severance and employee benefit costs. Since inception, we have incurred pre-tax charges to execute the program totaling $ 50,359 . \n\nMargin for Growth Program \n\nIn the first quarter of 2017, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;) unanimously approved several initiatives under a single program focused on improving global efficiency and effectiveness, optimizing the Company&#8217;s supply chain, streamlining the Company&#8217;s operating model and reducing administrative expenses to generate long-term savings. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized total costs associated with the Margin for Growth Program of $ 2,170 . These charges included other program costs, which related primarily to third-party charges in support of our initiative to improve global efficiency and effectiveness. This project was completed in mid-2020. \n\nThe costs and related benefits of the Margin for Growth Program relate approximately 63 % to the North America Confectionery segment and 37 % to the International segment.

We recognized a net tax expense of $ 4,862 , $ 8,924 and $ 1,564 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for interest and penalties. Accrued net interest and penalties were $ 25,328 as of December 31, 2022 and $ 20,466 as of December 31, 2021. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States, including various state and local returns, and in other foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely audited by taxing authorities in our filing jurisdictions, and a number of these disputes are currently underway, including multi-year controversies at various stages of review, negotiation and litigation in Mexico, China, Canada and the United States. The outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, including the timing of resolution or potential settlements. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management&#8217;s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Based on our current assessments, we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. \n\nWe reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $ 22,253 within the next 12 months because of the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlements of tax audits. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $ 620,697 of undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. During 2020, previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested; however, the Company had previously recognized a one-time U.S. repatriation tax due under U.S. tax reform, and as a result, only an immaterial amount of withholding tax was recognized. We intend to continue to reinvest the remainder of the earnings outside of the United States for which there would be a material tax implication to distributing, such as withholding tax, for the foreseeable future and, therefore, have not recognized additional tax expense on these earnings beyond the one-time U.S. repatriation tax due under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 76 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nInvestments in Partnerships Qualifying for Tax Credits \n\nWe invest in partnerships which make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits. The investments are accounted for under the equity method and reported within other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The tax credits, when realized, are recognized as a reduction of tax expense under the flow-through method, at which time the corresponding equity investment is written-down to reflect the remaining value of the future benefits to be realized. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 we recognized investment tax credits and related outside basis difference benefits totaling $ 228,819 , $ 136,243 and $ 146,021 , respectively, and we wrote-down the equity investment by $ 188,286 , $ 113,756 and $ 125,579 , respectively, to reflect the realization of these benefits. The equity investment write-down is reflected within other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 17 ). \n\nInflation Reduction Act \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) was signed into law. The IRA enacted a 15% corporate minimum tax on certain corporations and an excise tax on share repurchases after December 31, 2022, and created and extended certain energy-related tax credits and incentives, as well as other provisions. We currently do not expect the tax-related provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including our annual effective tax rate, or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the IRA may have on our business and financial results. \n\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act \n\nOn March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (&#8220;ARPA&#8221;) was signed into law. The ARPA strengthens and extends certain federal programs enacted through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and other coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) relief measures, and establishes new federal programs, including provisions on taxes, healthcare and unemployment benefits. The ARPA did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax relief and government loans, grants and investments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n11. PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS \n\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. The primary plans are The Hershey Company Retirement Plan and The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees. These are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to January 1, 2007. We also sponsor two post-retirement benefit plans: health care and life insurance. The health care plan is contributory, with participants&#8217; contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non-contributory. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 77 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nObligations and Funded Status \n\nA summary of the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of these plans is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits Other Benefits December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in benefit obligation Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,076,180 &#160; $ 1,168,838 &#160; $ 211,490 &#160; $ 243,308 &#160; Service cost 17,500 &#160; 21,361 &#160; 302 &#160; 1,879 &#160; Interest cost 30,491 &#160; 18,320 &#160; 4,603 &#160; 3,857 &#160; Actuarial (gain) loss ( 184,775 ) ( 33,984 ) ( 28,145 ) ( 14,787 ) Settlement ( 82,907 ) ( 75,985 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Currency translation and other ( 3,268 ) 619 &#160; ( 613 ) 113 &#160; Benefits paid ( 22,936 ) ( 22,989 ) ( 22,748 ) ( 22,880 ) Projected benefit obligation at end of year 830,285 &#160; 1,076,180 &#160; 164,889 &#160; 211,490 &#160; Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 1,098,191 &#160; 1,100,245 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 196,969 ) 68,361 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Employer contributions 55,799 &#160; 28,220 &#160; 22,748 &#160; 22,880 &#160; Settlement ( 82,907 ) ( 75,985 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Currency translation and other ( 2,746 ) 339 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Benefits paid ( 22,936 ) ( 22,989 ) ( 22,748 ) ( 22,880 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 848,432 &#160; 1,098,191 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nFunded status at end of year \n\n$ 18,147 &#160; $ 22,011 &#160; $ ( 164,889 ) $ ( 211,490 ) \n\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: \n\nOther assets $ 53,495 &#160; $ 71,618 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Accrued liabilities ( 7,652 ) ( 12,584 ) ( 17,715 ) ( 17,886 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 27,696 ) ( 37,023 ) ( 147,174 ) ( 193,604 ) Total $ 18,147 &#160; $ 22,011 &#160; $ ( 164,889 ) $ ( 211,490 ) \n\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), net of tax: \n\nActuarial net (loss) gain $ ( 150,378 ) $ ( 132,917 ) $ 19,689 &#160; $ 1,137 &#160; Net prior service credit 12,435 &#160; 15,399 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net amounts recognized in AOCI $ ( 137,943 ) $ ( 117,518 ) $ 19,689 &#160; $ 1,137 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe projected benefit obligation during 2022 was impacted by actuarial gain of $ 184,775 which was mainly the result of the discount rate assumption increasing from 2.7 % at December 31, 2021 to 5.5 % at December 31, 2022.

The plans&#8217; expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. We base the asset return assumption on current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories. \n\nWe utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. This approach does not affect the measurement of our pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping. \n\nFor purposes of measuring our post-retirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2022, we assumed a 6.7 % annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for 2023, grading down to 5.0 % by 2030. For purposes of measuring our post-retirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2021, we assumed a 6.2 % annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for 2022, grading down to 5.0 % by 2025. \n\nThe valuations and assumptions reflect adoption of the Society of Actuaries updated Pri-2012 mortality tables with MP-2021 generational projection scales, which we adopted as of December 31, 2021. The Society of Actuaries did not update the Pri-2012 mortality tables in 2022. Adoption of the updated scales did not have a significant impact on our current pension obligations or net period benefit cost since our primary plans are cash balance plans and most participants take lump-sum settlements upon retirement. \n\nPlan Assets \n\nWe broadly diversify our pension plan assets across public equity, fixed income, diversified credit strategies and diversified alternative strategies asset classes. Our target asset allocation for our major domestic pension plans as of December 31, 2022 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Asset Class Target Asset Allocation Cash \n\n1 % Equity securities \n\n27 % Fixed income securities \n\n48 % Alternative investments, including real estate, listed infrastructure and other \n\n24 % ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, actual allocations were consistent with the targets and within our allowable ranges. We expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets within each asset class. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 80 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy (as defined in Note 6 ), pension plan assets at their fair values as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Quoted prices in active markets of identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant other unobservable inputs (Level 3) Investments Using NAV as a Practical Expedient (1) Total Cash and cash equivalents $ 327 &#160; $ 29,595 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 566 &#160; $ 30,488 &#160; Equity securities: Global all-cap (a) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 206,636 &#160; 206,636 &#160; Fixed income securities: U.S. government/agency &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 173,122 &#160; 173,122 &#160; Corporate bonds (b) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 58,646 &#160; 58,646 &#160; International government/corporate bonds (c) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 26,489 &#160; 26,489 &#160; Diversified credit (d) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 109,926 &#160; 109,926 &#160; Alternative investments: Global diversified assets (e) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 95,243 &#160; 95,243 &#160; Real assets fund (f) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 147,882 &#160; 147,882 &#160; Total pension plan assets $ 327 &#160; $ 29,595 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 818,510 &#160; $ 848,432 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, pension plan assets at their fair values as of December 31, 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Quoted prices in active markets of identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant other unobservable inputs (Level 3) Investments Using NAV as a Practical Expedient (1) Total Cash and cash equivalents \n\n$ 534 &#160; $ 23,715 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 649 &#160; $ 24,898 &#160; Equity securities: Global all-cap (a) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 294,090 &#160; 294,090 &#160; Fixed income securities: U.S. government/agency \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 248,579 &#160; 248,579 &#160; Corporate bonds (b) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 78,360 &#160; 78,360 &#160; International government/corporate bonds (c) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 31,922 &#160; 31,922 &#160; Diversified credit (d) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 154,004 &#160; 154,004 &#160; Alternative investments: Global diversified assets (e) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 97,412 &#160; 97,412 &#160; Real assets fund (f) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 168,926 &#160; 168,926 &#160; Total pension plan assets \n\n$ 534 &#160; $ 23,715 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,073,942 &#160; $ 1,098,191 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy but are included to reconcile to the amounts presented in our Obligations and Funded Status table. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 81 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\n##TABLE_START (a) This category comprises equity funds that primarily track the MSCI World Index or MSCI All Country World Index.

The fair value of the Level 2 assets was determined by management based on an assessment of valuations provided by asset management entities and was calculated by aggregating market prices for all underlying securities. \n\nInvestment objectives for our domestic plan assets are: \n\n&#8226; To ensure high correlation between the value of plan assets and liabilities; \n\n&#8226; To maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class; and \n\n&#8226; To focus on a long-term return objective. \n\nWe believe that there are no significant concentrations of risk within our plan assets as of December 31, 2022. We comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) and we prohibit investments and investment strategies not allowed by ERISA. We do not permit direct purchases of our Company&#8217;s securities or the use of derivatives for the purpose of speculation. We invest the assets of non-domestic plans in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. \n\nCash Flows and Plan Termination \n\nOur policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the ERISA, federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. \n\nWe made total contributions to the pension plans of $ 55,799 during 2022. In 2021, we made total contributions of $ 28,220 to the pension plans. For 2023, minimum funding requirements for our pension plans are approximately $ 1,746 . \n\nTotal benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants, including pension benefits funded from the plans and other benefits funded from Company assets, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Expected Benefit Payments \n\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028-2032 Pension Benefits \n\n$ 115,689 &#160; $ 88,637 &#160; $ 88,579 &#160; $ 91,949 &#160; $ 75,724 &#160; $ 326,440 &#160; Other Benefits \n\n17,745 &#160; 16,794 &#160; 15,579 &#160; 14,465 &#160; 13,654 &#160; 57,698 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSavings Plans \n\nThe Company sponsors several defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits to employees. Contributions to The Hershey Company 401(k) Plan and similar plans for non-domestic employees are based on a portion of eligible pay up to a defined maximum. All matching contributions were made in cash. Expense associated with the defined contribution plans was $ 61,477 in 2022, $ 58,883 in 2021 and $ 52,793 in 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 82 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\n12. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS \n\nShare-based grants for compensation and incentive purposes are made pursuant to the Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (&#8220;EICP&#8221;). The EICP provides for grants of one or more of the following stock-based compensation awards to employees, non-employee directors and certain service providers upon whom the successful conduct of our business is dependent: \n\n&#8226; Non-qualified stock options (&#8220;stock options&#8221;); \n\n&#8226; Performance stock units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;) and performance stock; \n\n&#8226; Stock appreciation rights; \n\n&#8226; Restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) and restricted stock; and \n\n&#8226; Other stock-based awards. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 65.8 million shares were authorized and approved by our stockholders for grants under the EICP. The EICP also provides for the deferral of stock-based compensation awards by participants if approved by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of our Board and if in accordance with an applicable deferred compensation plan of the Company. Currently, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee has authorized the deferral of PSU and RSU awards by certain eligible employees under the Company&#8217;s Deferred Compensation Plan. Our Board has authorized our non-employee directors to defer any portion of their cash retainer, committee chair fees and RSUs awarded that they elect to convert into deferred stock units under our Directors&#8217; Compensation Plan. \n\nAt the time stock options are exercised or PSUs and RSUs become payable, Common Stock is issued from our accumulated treasury shares. Dividend equivalents are credited on RSUs on the same date and at the same rate as dividends paid on our Common Stock. Dividend equivalents are charged to retained earnings and included in accrued liabilities until paid. \n\nAwards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, historical data is used to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. \n\nFor the periods presented, compensation expense for all types of stock-based compensation programs and the related income tax benefit recognized were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Pre-tax compensation expense \n\n$ 65,991 &#160; $ 66,711 &#160; $ 57,584 &#160; Related income tax benefit 9,635 &#160; 11,608 &#160; 8,580 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCompensation expenses for stock compensation plans are primarily included in SM&#38;A expense. As of December 31, 2022, total stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $ 74,635 and the weighted-average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized was approximately 1.9 years. \n\nStock Options \n\nThe exercise price of each stock option awarded under the EICP equals the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Each stock option has a maximum term of 10 years. Grants of stock options provide for pro-rated vesting, typically over a four-year period. Expense for stock options is based on grant date fair value and recognized on a straight-line method over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 83 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nA summary of activity relating to grants of stock options for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: ##TABLE_START Stock Options Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price (per share) Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at beginning of the period \n\n1,332,956 &#160; $ 102.78 4.4 years Granted 4,025 &#160; $ 202.03 Exercised \n\n( 351,503 ) $ 99.11 Forfeited ( 6,971 ) $ 123.07 Expired ( 1,873 ) $ 103.07 Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 \n\n976,634 &#160; $ 104.36 3.8 years $ 124,240 \n\nOptions exercisable as of December 31, 2022 \n\n943,561 &#160; $ 102.54 3.7 years $ 121,749 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe weighted-average fair value of options granted was $ 37.28 , $ 24.12 and $ 21.31 per share in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance objectives. We grant PSUs over 3 -year performance cycles. If we meet targets for financial measures at the end of the applicable 3 -year performance cycle, we award a resulting number of shares of our Common Stock to the participants. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award . \n\nFor PSUs granted, the target award is a combination of a market-based total shareholder return and performance-based components. For market-based condition components, market volatility and other factors are taken into consideration in determining the grant date fair value and the related compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. For performance-based condition components, we estimate the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved each quarter and adjust compensation expenses accordingly. The performance scores of PSUs granted in 2022, 2021, and 2020 can range from 0 % to 250 % of the targeted amounts. \n\nWe recognize the compensation expense associated with PSUs ratably over the 3 -year term. Compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value because the grants can only be settled in shares of our Common Stock. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component and the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock on the date of grant for performance-based components. \n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, we awarded RSUs to certain executive officers and other key employees under the EICP. We also awarded RSUs quarterly to non-employee directors. \n\nWe recognize the compensation expense associated with employee RSUs over a specified award vesting period based on the grant date fair value of our Common Stock. We recognize expense for employee RSUs based on the straight-line method. The compensation expense associated with non-employee director RSUs is recognized ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. \n\nA summary of activity relating to grants of PSUs and RSUs for the period ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units Number of units Weighted-average grant date fair value for equity awards (per unit) Outstanding at beginning of year \n\n1,303,521 &#160; $ 146.96 Granted \n\n313,285 &#160; $ 211.85 Performance assumption change (1) 77,150 &#160; $ 253.68 Vested \n\n( 516,502 ) $ 130.69 Forfeited \n\n( 35,775 ) $ 167.81 Outstanding at end of year \n\n1,141,679 &#160; $ 181.91 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Reflects the net number of PSUs above and below target levels based on the performance metrics. \n\nThe following table sets forth information about the fair value of the PSUs and RSUs granted for potential future distribution to employees and non-employee directors.

Each unit is equivalent to one share of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock. \n\n13. SEGMENT INFORMATION \n\nThe Company reports its operations through three segments: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International. This organizational structure aligns with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) manages our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment, and further aligns with our product categories and the key markets we serve. \n\n&#8226; North America Confectionery &#8211; This segment is responsible for our traditional chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position in the United States and Canada. This includes our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines. This segment also includes our retail operations, including Hershey&#8217;s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain of the Company&#8217;s trademarks and products to third parties around the world. \n\n&#8226; North America Salty Snacks &#8211; This segment is responsible for our salty snacking products in the United States. This includes ready-to-eat popcorn, baked and trans fat free snacks, pretzels and other snacks. \n\n&#8226; International &#8211; International is a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually material, including those geographic regions where we operate outside of North America. We currently have operations and manufacture product in Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia, primarily for consumers in these regions, and also distribute and sell confectionery products in export markets of Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Europe, Africa and other regions. \n\nFor segment reporting purposes, we use &#8220;segment income&#8221; to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. These items of our operating income are managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the CODM as well the measure of segment performance used for incentive compensation purposes. \n\nAccounting policies associated with our operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1 . \n\nAs discussed in Note 5 , derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. These derivatives are recognized at fair market value with the resulting realized and unrealized (gains) losses recognized in unallocated derivative (gains) losses outside of the reporting segment results until the related inventory is sold, at which time the related gains and losses are reallocated to segment income. This enables us to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income. \n\nCertain manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and other activities supporting our global operations are integrated to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, assets and capital expenditures are not managed on a segment basis and are not included in the information reported to the CODM for the purpose of evaluating performance or allocating resources. We disclose depreciation and amortization that is generated by segment-specific assets, since these amounts are included within the measure of segment income reported to the CODM. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 86 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nOur segment net sales and earnings were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net sales: \n\nNorth America Confectionery $ 8,536,480 &#160; $ 7,682,416 &#160; $ 7,084,860 &#160; North America Salty Snacks 1,029,405 555,424 438,224 International 853,409 733,497 626,635 Total $ 10,419,294 &#160; $ 8,971,337 &#160; $ 8,149,719 &#160; Segment income (loss): North America Confectionery $ 2,811,066 $ 2,475,873 $ 2,274,584 North America Salty Snacks 159,935 &#160; 100,777 &#160; 75,845 &#160; International 107,927 &#160; 74,170 &#160; ( 14 ) Total segment income 3,078,928 2,650,820 2,350,415 Unallocated corporate expense (1) 735,542 &#160; 614,875 &#160; 520,632 &#160; Unallocated mark-to-market losses (gains) on commodity derivatives 78,182 ( 24,376 ) 6,429 \n\nLong-lived asset impairment charges (see Note 6 ) \n\n&#8212; &#8212; 9,143 \n\nCosts associated with business realignment activities (see Note 9 ) \n\n4,417 &#160; 16,599 &#160; 31,513 &#160; Operating profit 2,260,787 2,043,722 1,782,698 \n\nInterest expense, net (see Note 4 ) \n\n137,557 &#160; 127,417 &#160; 149,374 &#160; \n\nOther (income) expense, net (see Note 17 ) \n\n206,159 119,081 138,327 Income before income taxes $ 1,917,071 &#160; $ 1,797,224 &#160; $ 1,494,997 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance, and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (d) acquisition-related costs and (e) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance. \n\nActivity within the unallocated mark-to-market losses (gains) on commodity derivatives is as follows: ##TABLE_START For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net gains on mark-to-market valuation of commodity derivative positions recognized in income $ ( 44,569 ) $ ( 85,402 ) $ ( 6,593 ) Net gains on commodity derivative positions reclassified from unallocated to segment income 122,751 &#160; 61,026 &#160; 13,022 &#160; Net losses (gains) on mark-to-market valuation of commodity derivative positions recognized in unallocated derivative losses (gains) $ 78,182 &#160; $ ( 24,376 ) $ 6,429 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the cumulative amount of mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives that have been recognized in our consolidated cost of sales and not yet allocated to reportable segments was $ 8,735 .

EQUITY AND TREASURY STOCK ACTIVITY \n\nWe had 1,055,000,000 authorized shares of capital stock as of December 31, 2022. Of this total, 900,000,000 shares were designated as Common Stock, 150,000,000 shares were designated as Class B Common Stock (&#8220;Class B Stock&#8221;) and 5,000,000 shares were designated as Preferred Stock. Each class has a par value of one dollar per share. \n\nHolders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. The holders of Common Stock have 1 vote per share and the holders of Class B Common Stock have 10 votes per share. However, the Common Stock holders, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of the Board. With respect to dividend rights, the Common Stock holders are entitled to cash dividends 10 % higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Common Stock. \n\nClass B Stock can be converted into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. During 2022, 2,500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were converted to Common Stock by Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Milton Hershey School Trust (the &#8220;School Trust&#8221;). During 2021 and 2020, no shares of Class B Stock were converted into Common Stock. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 88 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nChanges in the outstanding shares of Common Stock for the past three years were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Shares issued 221,553,025 &#160; 221,553,025 &#160; 221,553,025 &#160; Treasury shares at beginning of year ( 15,444,011 ) ( 13,325,898 ) ( 12,723,592 ) Stock repurchases: Shares repurchased in the open market under pre-approved share repurchase programs &#8212; &#160; ( 871,144 ) ( 951,138 ) Milton Hershey School Trust repurchase ( 1,000,000 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Shares repurchased in the open market to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options and incentive compensation ( 824,701 ) ( 2,005,500 ) ( 450,000 ) Stock issuances: Shares issued for stock options and incentive compensation 680,404 &#160; 758,531 &#160; 798,832 &#160; Treasury shares at end of year ( 16,588,308 ) ( 15,444,011 ) ( 13,325,898 ) Net shares outstanding at end of year 204,964,717 &#160; 206,109,014 &#160; 208,227,127 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn July 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $ 500,000 share repurchase authorization to repurchase shares of our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2022, $ 109,983 remained available for repurchases of our Common Stock under this program. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved an additional $ 500,000 share repurchase authorization. This program is to commence after the existing 2018 authorization is completed and is to be utilized at management&#8217;s discretion. We are authorized to purchase our outstanding shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions. The program has no expiration date and acquired shares of Common Stock will be held as treasury shares. Purchases under approved share repurchase authorizations are in addition to our practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans. \n\nHershey Trust Company \n\nHershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust and as direct owner of investment shares, held 39,630 shares of our Common Stock as of December 31, 2022. As trustee for the School Trust, Hershey Trust Company held 58,112,012 shares of the Class B Common Stock as of December 31, 2022, and was entitled to cast approximately 80 % of all of the votes entitled to be cast on matters requiring the vote of both classes of our common stock voting together. Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, or any successor trustee, or Milton Hershey School, as appropriate, must approve any issuance of shares of Common Stock or other action that would result in it not continuing to have voting control of our Company. \n\nStock Purchase Agreements \n\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock from the School Trust at a price equal to $ 239.91 per share, for a total purchase price of $ 239,910 . As a result of this repurchase, our July 2018 share repurchase authorization program was completed in February 2023. \n\nIn February 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock from the School Trust at a price equal to $ 203.35 per share, for a total purchase price of $ 203,350 . \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 89 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nPurchase obligations \n\nWe enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. These obligations are primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers. These contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations. Total obligations consisted of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. We mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent that we have entered into commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments to hedge our costs for those periods. Increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments. Taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had entered into agreements for the purchase of raw materials with various suppliers. Subject to meeting our quality standards, the purchase obligations covered by these agreements were as follows as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START in millions 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Purchase obligations $ 1,871.0 &#160; $ 202.6 &#160; $ 12.5 &#160; $ 12.5 &#160; $ 12.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEnvironmental contingencies \n\nWe have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. Our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. We do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos. \n\nLegal contingencies \n\nOn February 12, 2021, Issouf Coubaly, individually and on behalf of proposed class members, filed a complaint (Coubaly v. Nestl&#233; U.S.A. et al., 1:21-cv-00386-DLF (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2021)) in the District Court of the District of Columbia, seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages for alleged violations of child labor and human trafficking laws under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. The Company was among several defendants named in the suit. The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the case on July 30, 2021, and on June 28, 2022, the District Court granted the motion and dismissed the case without prejudice. On July 22, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia challenging the dismissal of the case. The Company continues to believe that the suit, including the appeal, is without merit and is defending vigorously against the appeal. \n\nIn addition to the above-referenced matter, the Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, which cover a wide range of matters including trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters, human and workplace rights matters and tax. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of such proceedings and claims with certainty, in our opinion these matters, both individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 90 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\nCollective Bargaining \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 18,075 full-time and 1,790 part-time employees worldwide. Collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 6,470 employees, or approximately 33 % of the Company&#8217;s employees worldwide. During 2023, agreements will be negotiated for certain employees at five facilities, four of which are outside of the United States, comprising approximately 67 % of total employees under collective bargaining agreements. We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 91 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\n16. EARNINGS PER SHARE \n\nWe compute basic earnings per share for Common Stock and Class B common stock using the two-class method. The Class B common stock is convertible into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. In June 2022, 1,500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were converted to Common Stock by Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust. The computation of diluted earnings per share for Common Stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock using the if-converted method, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares. \n\nWe compute basic and diluted earnings per share based on the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock and Class B common stock outstanding as follows: ##TABLE_START For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Common Stock Class B Common Stock Common Stock Class B Common Stock Common Stock Class B Common Stock Basic earnings per share: Numerator: Allocation of distributed earnings (cash dividends paid) $ 567,897 &#160; $ 207,133 &#160; $ 498,084 &#160; $ 187,903 &#160; $ 467,013 &#160; $ 173,719 &#160; Allocation of undistributed earnings \n\n637,438 &#160; 232,349 &#160; 574,772 &#160; 216,753 &#160; 464,802 &#160; 173,174 &#160; Total earnings&#8212;basic $ 1,205,335 &#160; $ 439,482 &#160; $ 1,072,856 &#160; $ 404,656 &#160; $ 931,815 &#160; $ 346,893 &#160; Denominator (shares in thousands): Total weighted-average shares&#8212;basic 146,713 &#160; 58,822 &#160; 146,120 &#160; 60,614 &#160; 147,832 &#160; 60,614 &#160; Earnings Per Share&#8212;basic $ 8.22 &#160; $ 7.47 &#160; $ 7.34 &#160; $ 6.68 &#160; $ 6.30 &#160; $ 5.72 &#160; Diluted earnings per share: Numerator: Allocation of total earnings used in basic computation $ 1,205,335 &#160; $ 439,482 &#160; $ 1,072,856 &#160; $ 404,656 &#160; $ 931,815 &#160; $ 346,893 &#160; Reallocation of total earnings as a result of conversion of Class B common stock to Common stock 439,482 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 404,656 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 346,893 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Reallocation of undistributed earnings &#8212; &#160; ( 1,201 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 1,098 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 822 ) Total earnings&#8212;diluted $ 1,644,817 &#160; $ 438,281 &#160; $ 1,477,512 &#160; $ 403,558 &#160; $ 1,278,708 &#160; $ 346,071 &#160; Denominator (shares in thousands): Number of shares used in basic computation 146,713 &#160; 58,822 &#160; 146,120 &#160; 60,614 &#160; 147,832 &#160; 60,614 &#160; Weighted-average effect of dilutive securities: Conversion of Class B common stock to Common shares outstanding 58,822 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 60,614 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 60,614 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Employee stock options 571 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 609 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 600 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Performance and restricted stock units 469 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 415 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 368 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total weighted-average shares&#8212;diluted 206,575 &#160; 58,822 &#160; 207,758 &#160; 60,614 &#160; 209,414 &#160; 60,614 &#160; Earnings Per Share&#8212;diluted $ 7.96 &#160; $ 7.45 &#160; $ 7.11 &#160; $ 6.66 &#160; $ 6.11 &#160; $ 5.71 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe earnings per share calculations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 excluded 5 , 43 and 15 stock options (in thousands), respectively, that would have been antidilutive. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 92 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated) \n\n17.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS \n\nHershey Trust Company, as trustee for the trust established by Milton S. and Catherine S. Hershey that has as its sole beneficiary the School Trust, maintains voting control over The Hershey Company. \n\nIn any given year, we may engage in certain transactions with Hershey Trust Company, Milton Hershey School, the Milton Hershey School Trust and companies owned by and/or affiliated with any of the foregoing. Most transactions with these related parties are immaterial and do not require disclosure, but certain transactions are more significant in nature and have been deemed material for disclosure. \n\nA summary of material related party transactions with Hershey Trust Company and/or its affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: \n\nSale and Donation of Property, Plant and Equipment \n\nIn May 2022, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell certain real and personal property consisting of approximately six acres of land located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, together with portions of a building located on the land. Additionally, in June 2022, the Company entered into a Donation Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for The M.S. Hershey Foundation, pursuant to which the Company agreed to donate a portion of the building concurrently with the closing of the Purchase Agreement. The sale and donation transactions closed in June 2022.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management, with the participation of the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\nDesign and Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company&#8217;s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company&#8217;s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nManagement&#8217;s report on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting appears on the following page. There were no changes in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nWe rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) system, which will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company&#8217;s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company&#8217;s management team related to the operation of the business. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the implementation of our new ERP system for one operating segment which is included in our International segment. The portion of the transition to the new ERP system which we have completed to date did not result in significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting. However, as the next phases of the updated processes are rolled out in connection with the ERP implementation, we will give appropriate consideration to whether these process changes necessitate changes in the design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nThe Hershey Company | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 95 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nThe management of The Hershey Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company&#8217;s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#8217;s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. \n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management, including the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company&#8217;s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control&#8211;Integrated Framework (2013 edition) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s independent auditors have audited, and reported on, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\n"
