(Evergy Metro) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Missouri West, Inc. (Evergy Missouri West) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Transmission Company, LLC (Evergy Transmission Company) owns 13.5% of Transource Energy, LLC (Transource) with the remaining 86.5% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP). Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects. Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central also owns a 50% interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind), which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. Prairie Wind owns a 108-mile, 345 kilovolt (kV) double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP). Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro, and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy. The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment). Evergy serves approximately 1,652,200 customers located in Kansas and Missouri. Customers include approximately 1,444,900 residences, 199,500 commercial firms and 7,800 industrials, municipalities and other electric utilities. Evergy is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one-third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter. \n\nEvergy expects to continue operating its integrated utilities within the currently existing regulatory frameworks and is focused on empowering a better future for its customers, communities, employees and shareholders. The core tenets of Evergy's strategy are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Affordability &#8211; operating the business cost-effectively and investing in technology and infrastructure to keep rates affordable and improve regional rate competitiveness; mitigating fuel and purchased power volatility by investing in a diverse generation fleet; \n\n&#8226; Reliability &#8211; targeting transmission and distribution infrastructure investment to support reliability, flexibility, public safety, and resiliency; deploying new technology to improve preventive maintenance and customer restoration times; and \n\n&#8226; Sustainability - investing at sustainable capital expenditure levels to maintain reliability and customer affordability for the long-term and balancing clean energy investment to continue fuel diversification and enable a responsible generation portfolio transition. \n\nSee Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Operations (MD&#38;A) - Executive Summary &#8211; Strategy, for additional information. \n\nThe table below summarizes the percentage of Evergy's revenues by customer classification. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Residential 37% 34% 39% Commercial 32% 30% 33% Industrial 12% 11% 12% Wholesale 9% 13% 5% Transmission 6% 6% 6% Other 4% 6% 5% Total 100% 100% 100% ##TABLE_END\n\nThe table below summarizes the percentage of Evergy's retail electricity sales by customer class. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Residential 38% 37% 38% Commercial 42% 42% 42% Industrial 20% 21% 20% Total 100% 100% 100% ##TABLE_END\n\nRegulation \n\nEvergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas operations are regulated by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) and Evergy Metro's Missouri operations and Evergy Missouri West are regulated by the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri (MPSC), in each case with respect to retail rates, certain accounting matters, standards of service and, in certain cases, the issuance of securities, certification of facilities and service territories. The Evergy Companies are also subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to transmission, wholesale sales and rates, the issuance of securities in certain cases and other matters. Evergy has an indirect 94% ownership interest in Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek), which is subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with respect to licensing, operations and safety-related requirements. \n\nThe table below summarizes the rate orders in effect for Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's retail rate jurisdictions. \n\n##TABLE_START Regulator Allowed Return on Equity Rate-Making Equity Ratio Effective Date \n\nEvergy Kansas Central (a) \n\nKCC 9.3% 51.46% September 2018 Evergy Metro - Kansas KCC 9.3% 49.09% December 2018 Evergy Metro - Missouri MPSC (b) (b) January 2023 Evergy Missouri West MPSC (b) (b) January 2023 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The KCC establishes rates for Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South on a consolidated basis. \n\n(b) Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's current MPSC rate orders do not contain an allowed return on equity or rate-making equity ratio. \n\nEvergy expects its 2023 Kansas and Missouri jurisdictional retail revenues to be approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, based on historical averages of Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's total retail revenues. \n\nSee Item 7, MD&#38;A, Critical Accounting Policies section, and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters. \n\nCompetition \n\nMissouri and Kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model. As a result, the Evergy Companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies. If Missouri or Kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice, Evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations, which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a write-off of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. \n\nEvergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory. This competition primarily occurs within the SPP Integrated Marketplace, in which Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are participants. This marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum regional cost-effectiveness. \n\nThe SPP Integrated Marketplace is similar to other RTO or Independent System Operator (ISO) markets currently operating in other regions of the United States. \n\nPower Supply \n\nEvergy has approximately 15,400 megawatts (MWs) of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements. Evergy's owned generation and power purchases from others, as a percentage of total megawatt hours (MWhs) generated and purchased, was approximately 70% and 30%, respectively, over the last three years. Evergy purchases power to meet its customers' needs, to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards. Management believes Evergy will be able to meet its future power purchase needs due to the coordination of planning and operations in the SPP region and existing power purchase agreements; however, price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand or reduced supply. \n\nEvergy's total capacity by fuel type, including both owned generating capacity and power purchase agreements, is detailed in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START Fuel Type Estimated 2023 MW Capacity Percent of Total Capacity Coal 5,916 38 % \n\nWind (a) \n\n4,326 28 Natural gas and oil 3,998 26 Uranium 1,106 7 \n\nSolar, landfill gas and hydroelectric (b) \n\n78 1 Total capacity 15,424 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) MWs are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility. Includes owned generating capacity of 579 MWs and long-term power purchase agreements of approximately 3,747 MWs of wind generation that expire from 2028 through 2048. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information. \n\n(b) Includes a long-term power purchase agreement for approximately 66 MWs of hydroelectric generation that expires in 2023. \n\nEvergy's projected peak summer demand for 2023 is approximately 10,200 MWs. Evergy expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for 2023 with its existing generation assets and power purchases. See \"Transitioning Evergy's Generation Fleet\" below for further information regarding Evergy's long-term strategy with regards to its generating assets and power purchases. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are members of the SPP. The SPP is a FERC-approved RTO with the responsibility to ensure reliable power supply, adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale electricity prices in the region. As SPP members, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 15%. This net positive supply of capacity is maintained through generation asset ownership, capacity agreements, power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs. The reserve margin is designed to support reliability of the region's electric supply. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and hazardous substance disposal, protected natural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species and other protected wildlife) and health and safety. For example, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West combust large amounts of fossil fuels in the production of electricity, which results in significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other greenhouse gases (GHG). Federal legislation regulates the emission of GHGs and numerous states and regions have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA), water under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), among other laws and regulations. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. There have been, and management believes there will continue to be, policy, legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change, such as efforts to reduce GHG emissions, impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for low-carbon generation and energy efficiency. These efforts, and climate change itself, have the potential to adversely affect the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. \n\nThe Evergy Companies have taken, and will continue to take, proactive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on its businesses. For example, the Evergy Companies regularly conduct preparedness exercises for a variety of disruptive events, including storms, which may become more frequent or intense due to climate change. In addition, the Evergy Companies have invested, and will continue to invest, in grid resiliency. Much of the Evergy Companies' infrastructure is aged, and grid resiliency efforts include building additional transmission and distribution lines, replacing aged infrastructure and proactively managing the vegetation that can damage systems \n\nduring severe weather. The Evergy Companies also monitor water conditions at their generating facilities and focus on water conservation at these facilities to address resource depletion. \n\nTransitioning Evergy's Generation Fleet \n\nThe Evergy Companies are committed to a long-term strategy to reduce CO 2 emissions in a cost-effective and reliable manner. In 2022, Evergy achieved a reduction of CO 2 emissions by nearly half from 2005 levels. Evergy has a goal to achieve net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2045 with an interim goal of a 70% reduction of CO 2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The trajectory and timing of reaching the net-zero goal are dependent on many external factors, including enabling technology developments, the reliability of the power grid, availability of transmission capacity, supportive energy policies and regulations, and other factors. See \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\" and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. \n\nPublic attention is currently focused on transitioning to a low carbon future, including reducing GHG emissions and closing coal-fired generating units. Diversity of fuel supply has historically provided cost and reliability benefits. For example, because renewable generation is intermittent, diversity of baseload generation, including a mix of coal and natural gas, has helped to maintain a consistent availability of power. In addition, the Evergy Companies must prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the Evergy Companies to include in rates. The Evergy Companies use a triennial integrated resource plan, which is a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and demand for electricity, to inform the manner in which they supply electricity. The integrated resource plan considers forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, cost of environmental compliance, integration of renewables, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response initiatives. Strategies that the Evergy Companies are pursuing to reduce emissions include: \n\n&#8226; retiring fossil fuel generation; \n\n&#8226; developing renewable energy facilities; \n\n&#8226; collaborating with regulators to offer customers the opportunity to procure electricity produced with renewable resources; and \n\n&#8226; investing in customer energy efficiency programs. \n\nSince 2005, the Evergy Companies have added over 4,400 MWs of renewable generation, while retiring more than 2,400 MWs of fossil generation. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information regarding the Evergy Companies' renewable generation resources. The Evergy Companies are also committed to transparency. On its website, http://investors.evergy.com, Evergy provides quantitative and qualitative data regarding various environmental, social and governance matters, including information related to emissions, waste and water. The contents of the website, including reports and documents contained therein, are not incorporated into this filing. \n\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. \n\nFuel \n\nThe fuel sources for Evergy's owned generation and power purchase agreements are coal, wind and other renewable sources, uranium and natural gas and oil. The actual 2022 fuel mix and fuel cost in cents per net kilowatt hour (kWh) delivered are outlined in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Fuel cost in cents per Fuel Mix (a) \n\nnet kWh delivered Actual Actual Fuel 2022 2022 Coal 48 % 2.33&#162; \n\nWind, hydroelectric, landfill gas and solar (b) \n\n31 2.20 Uranium 16 0.66 Natural gas and oil 5 9.26 Total 100 % 2.36 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Fuel mix based on percent of net MWhs generated by owned resources and delivered under renewable power purchase agreements. \n\n(b) Fuel cost in cents per net kWh delivered includes costs associated with renewable power purchase agreements. \n\nCoal \n\nDuring 2023, Evergy's generating units, including jointly-owned units, are projected to use approximately 17 million tons of coal. Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have entered into coal-purchase contracts with various suppliers in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB), the nation's principal supply region of low-sulfur coal, and with local suppliers. The coal to be provided under these contracts is expected to satisfy approximately 65%, 15% and 5% of the projected coal requirements for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. The remainder of the coal requirements is expected to be fulfilled through entering into additional contracts or spot market purchases. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the PRB and local suppliers to their generating units. The transportation services to be provided under these contracts are expected to satisfy almost all of the projected transportation requirements for 2023, 2024 and 2025. The contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs. \n\nNuclear Fuel \n\nEvergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro each owns 47% of Wolf Creek, which is Evergy's only nuclear generating unit. Wolf Creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor. This process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract all the uranium, uranium enrichment and conversion services needed to operate Wolf Creek through the first quarter of 2030. The owners also have under contract all the uranium fabrication services required to operate Wolf Creek through 2045. \n\nNatural Gas \n\nEvergy purchases natural gas for use in its generating units primarily through spot market purchases. From time to time, Evergy also may enter into contracts, including the use of derivatives, in an effort to manage the cost of natural gas. For additional information about Evergy's exposure to commodity price risks, see Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West maintain natural gas transportation arrangements with Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. The Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. arrangement expires based on the generating unit being served with expiration dates from 2023 to 2030. \n\nCustomer Energy Efficiency Programs \n\nThe Evergy Companies have implemented, and continue to offer, energy efficiency programs to help customers with their energy efficiency needs and to help manage energy costs. Both Missouri and Kansas have passed legislation promoting the implementation of cost-effective demand-side management programs and allowing for the recovery of these program costs from customers, along with the potential to earn performance incentives based upon certain criteria. \n\nIn Missouri, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West currently offer a suite of energy efficiency programs for customers under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA). The current portfolio of programs was approved by the MPSC in 2019 for the years 2020 through 2022 and provides for the recovery of program costs, throughput disincentive and the opportunity to earn a performance incentive based upon demand and energy savings achieved. The costs of the programs are recovered from customers through a rider mechanism. Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West requested an extension of these programs and in May 2022 the MPSC approved the extension through 2023. \n\nIn Kansas, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro requested KCC authorization in December 2021 for a suite of energy efficiency programs for customers under the Kansas Energy Efficiency Investment Act (KEEIA). The requested portfolio of programs would provide for the recovery of program costs, throughput disincentive and the opportunity to earn a performance incentive based upon demand and energy savings achieved. The costs of the program would be recovered from customers through a rider mechanism. Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's proposed programs would be effective in 2023 through 2026. The KCC's decision on Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's KEEIA request is expected in the first half of 2023. \n\nHuman Capital Resources \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Evergy Companies had 4,512 employees, including 2,406 represented by five local unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and one local union of the United Government Security Officers of America (UGSOA). The Evergy Companies currently have labor agreements with each of these unions that expire at varying times in 2024 through 2026. The Evergy Companies employ 1,579 generation employees, 1,388 transmission and distribution employees and 1,545 support employees that work primarily in the states of Kansas and Missouri. \n\nEvergy's mission is to empower a better future and a key component of this mission is maintaining a culture that emphasizes safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability. \n\nSafety is a crucial part of Evergy's values. The components of Evergy's safety program include a strong management commitment to a safety-conscious work environment, hazard recognition and control, worksite analysis, contractor safety management and training. Evergy also conducts regular safety audits and assessments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Evergy has prioritized the safety of its employees while continuing to serve its customers and community by providing appropriate personal protective equipment, establishing additional training and protocols and allowing employees to work remotely when possible. \n\nEvergy is also working to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce through recruiting and hiring practices, performance management, training and data analysis and reporting initiatives. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy's workforce was 78% male and 22% female, and women represented 25% of Evergy's officer team. The ethnicity of Evergy's workforce was 85% White, 5% Black, 4% Hispanic and 6% other. \n\nEvergy offers a competitive package of compensation and benefits to attract and retain talented employees, including market-competitive pay, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off, family leave and tuition reimbursement. Evergy also allows employees to participate in a comprehensive well-being program that includes health and wellness-related activities and incentives, business resource groups, gym membership reimbursement, paid volunteer hours, charitable donation match and free access to an employee assistance program. \n\nInformation About Evergy's Executive Officers \n\nSet forth below is information relating to the executive officers of Evergy, Inc.

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nUtility Regulatory Risks: \n\nPrices are established by regulators and may not be sufficient to recover costs or provide for a return on investment. \n\nThe prices that the FERC, KCC and MPSC authorize the utility subsidiaries of Evergy to charge significantly influence the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nIn general, utilities are allowed to recover in customer rates costs that were prudently incurred to provide utility service, plus a reasonable return on invested capital. There can be no assurance, however, that regulators will determine costs to have been prudently incurred. Further, the amounts approved by the regulators may not be sufficient to allow for a recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on and of capital investments. Also, amounts that were approved by regulators may be appealed, modified, limited or eliminated by subsequent regulatory or legislative actions. A failure to recover costs or earn a reasonable return on invested capital could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Evergy and its utility subsidiaries. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are also exposed to cost-recovery shortfalls due to the inherent \"regulatory lag\" in the rate-setting process. This is because utility rates are generally based on historical information and, except for certain situations where regulators allow for recovery of expenses through use of a formula that tracks costs, are not subject to adjustment between rate cases. Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro agreed to a five-year base rate moratorium in Kansas beginning in December 2018. In addition, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West utilize a plant-in service accounting (PISA) legislative mechanism in Missouri, which limits the extent to which prices can increase after a general rate case to approximately 3% on an annualized basis. Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West each filed rate cases in 2022 under the PISA constraints described above and new rates became effective in January 2023. These and other factors may result in under-recovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment, or both. \n\nFurthermore, during 2021 and 2022, the United States' economy experienced a substantial rise in the inflation rate compared to recent historical inflation rates. While the Federal Reserve Bank has announced certain measures to combat rising inflation, there remains uncertainty in the near-term outlook as to whether inflation will continue and whether actions by the Federal Reserve Bank will result in a recession. Increases in inflation raise the Evergy Companies' costs for labor, materials and services. Furthermore, a failure to recover increased capital costs could result in under-recovery of costs. \n\nFailure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects, the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances, regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings, reduced access to capital markets, increased financing costs, lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures. In response to competitive, economic, political, legislative, public perception and regulatory pressures, Evergy's utility subsidiaries may be subject to rate moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions, including phase-in plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period for the benefit of customers. In addition, Transource, which Evergy owns a 13.5% interest, is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects across the United States and faces similar risks with respect to projects located in regulatory jurisdictions outside of Kansas and Missouri. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nLegislative and regulatory requirements may increase costs and result in compliance penalties. \n\nFERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and SPP have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability, cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities. The MPSC and KCC have the authority to implement utility operational standards and \n\nrequirements, such as vegetation management standards, facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards. In addition, Evergy is also subject to health, safety and other requirements enacted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and other federal and state agencies. As discussed more fully below, the Evergy Companies are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations related to nuclear power generation. The costs of complying with existing, new or modified regulations, standards and other requirements could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. Furthermore, regulatory changes could result in operational changes that increase costs or adversely impact the Evergy Companies' prospects. In addition, failure to meet quality of service, reliability, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, operational or other standards and requirements could expose the Evergy Companies to penalties, additional compliance costs or adverse rate consequences, any of which could have a material adverse impact on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nEnvironmental Risks: \n\nCosts to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air and water quality, waste management and hazardous substance disposal, protected natural resources and health and safety, are significant and may adversely impact operations and financial results. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and hazardous substance disposal, protected natural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species and other protected wildlife) and health and safety. See Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In general, over time these laws and regulations have become and continue to become increasingly stringent and compliance with these laws and regulations require an increasing share of capital and operating resources, which may reduce the amount of resources available for other business objectives, including capital investments. \n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and requirements requires significant capital and operating resources. Regulators may also disagree with the Evergy Companies' interpretation or application of these laws, regulations and requirements. The failure to comply with these laws, regulations and requirements could result in substantial fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. For example, Evergy Kansas Central recently decommissioned the Tecumseh Energy Center and removed all coal combustion residuals (CCRs) from a surface impoundment in a manner it believed complied with federal law, but the EPA has reviewed and determined Evergy Kansas Central should have taken additional or alternative actions, even though the facility is closed. A resulting consent order with the EPA has been agreed to by Evergy Kansas Central and additional groundwater monitoring activities have been initiated at the site. \n\nThe EPA has begun issuing CCR Part A and Part B rule extension application determinations for companies that applied for approval to operate unlined or clay-lined impoundments past April 2021. The Evergy Companies did not apply for an extension, however, these proposed determinations include extensive CCR rule interpretations and compliance expectations that may impact all owners of CCR units. The new interpretations could require modified compliance plans such as different methods of CCR unit closure. Additionally, more stringent remediation requirements for units that are in corrective action or forced to go into corrective action could result in substantial costs or operational impacts. \n\nIn January 2022, the EPA announced changes following a tour by the EPA administrator conducted in the second half of 2021 to address environmental justice issues in communities that are marginalized, underserved and overburdened by pollution. These changes will include additional unannounced inspections of suspected non-compliant facilities, deploying new assets to monitor air pollution and a general increase in overall monitoring and oversight. The EPA's announcement focused on industries in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas but includes similar agency-wide action in parallel. The Evergy Companies have multiple power plants located in communities that would be considered a higher priority by the EPA based on existing demographics. These sites could be subject to additional monitoring and unannounced inspections in the future. In September 2022, the EPA and the Missouri \n\nDepartment of Natural Resources (MDNR) conducted a CAA environmental justice inspection of the Evergy Companies' Hawthorn Generating Station. No CAA noncompliance issues were found. \n\nEnvironmental permits are subject to periodic renewal, which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits. New facilities, or modifications of existing facilities, may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits. Delays in the environmental permitting process, public opposition and challenges, denials of permit applications, limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects, and thus materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. In addition, compliance with environmental laws, regulations and requirements could alter the way assets are managed, which in turn could result in retiring assets earlier than expected, recording asset retirement obligations (AROs) or having a regulator disallow recovery of costs that had been prudently incurred in connection with those assets. There is also a risk of lawsuits alleging violations of environmental laws, regulations or requirements, claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters, and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other relief. \n\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws, regulations and requirements, or fines, penalties or negative lawsuit outcomes, if not recovered in rates from customers, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nFinancial Risks: \n\nFinancial market volatility or declines in the Evergy Companies' credit ratings may increase financing costs and limit access to the credit markets, which may adversely affect liquidity and financial results. \n\nThe Evergy Companies rely on funds from operations and access to the capital and credit markets to fund capital expenditures and for working capital and liquidity. Volatility in capital or credit markets, increases in interest rates, deterioration in the financial condition of the financial institutions on which the Evergy Companies rely, credit rating downgrades, delays in regulatory approvals for certain refinancings, a decrease in the market price of Evergy's common stock or a decrease or disappearance in the demand for debt securities issued by the Evergy Companies or subsidiaries could have material adverse effects on the Evergy Companies. These effects could include, among others: reduced access to capital and increased cost of borrowed funds and collateral requirements; dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices; increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan funding requirements; reduced ability to pay dividends; rate case disallowance of costs of capital; reductions in or delays of capital expenditures; delayed access to the capital markets at opportune times; and limitations in the ability of Evergy to provide credit support for its subsidiaries. \n\nThe Evergy Companies plan to make significant capital investments in renewable generation and to enhance the customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency and improve efficiency, which are expected to be funded with cash flows from operations and debt. If cash flows from operations are lower than expected or the costs of these capital investments are higher than expected, additional debt will be required to fund the investments, which, in turn, may create pressure on the Evergy Companies' credit ratings or result in a ratings downgrade and increase their cost of capital. In 2021, a credit ratings agency assigned the Evergy Companies a negative outlook, while affirming ratings, due to perceived risk related to increased capital expenditures and the ability to earn a return of and on those investments through upcoming rate cases. Further, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro have outstanding tax-exempt bonds that may be put back to the respective issuer at the option of the holders, which could adversely impact liquidity. Additionally, the appeal by the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC) of the financing order for Evergy Missouri West to recover costs incurred in connection with the February 2021 winter weather event through the issuance of securitized bonds will result in a delay of such issuance and may increase financing costs. Finally, market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on Evergy's lenders, suppliers and other counterparties or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. \n\nEvergy is a holding company and relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations. \n\nEvergy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. The primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its direct subsidiaries, \n\nparticularly Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West. Evergy's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Evergy with funds. The ability of Evergy's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions, and accordingly, Evergy's ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations, principally depends on the earnings and cash flows, capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries, as well as regulatory factors, financial covenants, general business conditions and other matters. \n\nIn addition, the Evergy Companies are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends. Under the Federal Power Act, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings. Each of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West has committed to Missouri regulators to not pay dividends to Evergy if its credit rating falls below BBB- for S&#38;P Global Ratings or Baa3 for Moody's Investor Services. Each of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro has committed to Kansas regulators to not pay dividends to Evergy if (i) the payment would result in an increase in the utility's debt level (excluding short-term debt and debt due within one year) above 60 percent of its total capitalization, absent approval from the KCC or (ii) if its credit rating falls below BBB- for S&#38;P Global Ratings or Baa3 for Moody's Investor Services. Under various debt agreements, the Evergy Companies are also required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00, which could restrict the amount of dividends the Evergy Companies are permitted to pay. Evergy cannot guarantee dividends will be paid in the future or that, if paid, dividends will satisfy announced targets or investor expectations or be paid with the same frequency as in the past. \n\nIn addition, from time to time Evergy has in the past and may in the future guarantee debt obligations of its subsidiaries. Under the financing agreements to which Evergy is a party, a guarantee of debt may be considered indebtedness for purposes of complying with financial covenants that dictate the extent to which Evergy can borrow money, and any guarantee payments could adversely affect Evergy's liquidity and ability to service its own debt obligations. \n\nSupply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact the Evergy Companies' operations and corporate strategy. \n\nThe operations and business plans of the Evergy Companies depend on the global supply chain to procure the equipment, materials and other resources necessary to build and provide services in a safe and reliable manner. The delivery of components, materials, equipment and other resources that are critical to the Evergy Companies' business operations and corporate strategy has been restricted by domestic and global supply chain upheaval. This has resulted in the shortage of critical items. International tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflict, could further exacerbate the global supply chain upheaval. These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations and corporate strategy. The constraints in the supply chain could restrict the availability and delay the construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support normal operations or are required to execute on the Evergy Companies' corporate strategy for continued capital investment in utility equipment. These disruptions and constraints could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nSupply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment and other needed commodities and these higher prices may continue in the future. The economy in the United States has encountered a material level of inflation and that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the outlook of near term economic activity, including whether inflation will continue and at what rate. Increases in inflation raise costs for labor, materials and services. The Evergy Companies typically recover increases in costs from customers through rates. Failure to recover increased costs could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nPublic health crises, epidemics, or pandemics could adversely affect the Evergy Companies' business functions, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. \n\nPublic health crises, epidemics, or pandemics and any related government responses may adversely impact the economy and financial markets and could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Evergy Companies, including a decrease in revenues, increased credit loss expense; increases in past due accounts receivable balances; and access to the capital markets at unreasonable terms or rates. \n\nPublic health crises, epidemics, or pandemics and any related government responses could also impair the Evergy Companies' ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities. Risks include extended disruptions to supply chains and inflation, resulting in increased costs for labor, materials, and services, which could adversely impact the Evergy Companies' ability to implement their corporate strategy. The Evergy Companies may also be adversely impacted by labor disruptions and productivity as a result of infections, employee attrition, and a reduced ability to replace departing employees as a result of employees who leave or forego employment to avoid any required precautionary measures. \n\nDespite the Evergy Companies' efforts to manage the impacts of public health crises, epidemics, or pandemics that may occur in the future, the extent to which they may affect them depends on factors beyond their knowledge or control. As a result, the Evergy Companies are unable to determine the potential impact any such public health crises, epidemics, or pandemics may have on their business plans and operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nIncreasing costs associated with defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans, health care plans and other employee benefits could adversely affect Evergy's financial position and liquidity. \n\nEvergy maintains defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement employee benefit plans for certain current and former employees. The costs of these plans depend on a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, the level and nature of the provided benefits, discount rates, the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels, changes in benefit design, changes in laws or regulations and the amount of any required or voluntary contributions to the plans. The Evergy Companies have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans. Also, if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels, these plans experience adverse market returns on investments or interest rates fall, required or voluntary contributions to the plans could be material. In addition, changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nThe costs of providing health care benefits to employees and retirees have increased in recent years and may continue to rise in the future. Future legislative changes related to health care could also cause significant changes to benefit programs and costs. The increasing costs associated with health care plans could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to commodity and other risks associated with energy markets. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are required to maintain generation capacity that satisfies regulatory mandates and are obligated to provide power when required by the SPP or pursuant to contractual obligations. Although the Evergy Companies generally have regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power necessary to satisfy these requirements, regulatory or legislative actions could limit, eliminate or delay recovery of these expenses after the expenses have been incurred. \n\nThe Evergy Companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity and the wholesale purchase of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to energy marketing activities and the management of third-party generation facilities. These activities expose the Evergy Companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energy-related products, as well as credit exposure to their counterparties. Exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors, including the availability and cost of fuel and power that the Evergy Companies purchase on the wholesale markets to serve customer load or to satisfy their regulatory or contractual obligations, the ability or effectiveness of strategies utilized by the Evergy Companies to hedge these risks, the extent to which the Evergy Companies may be required to post collateral for the benefit of third parties \n\nand the risk that counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations to the Evergy Companies. Market volatility can increase or create unanticipated risks. Regional transmission organizations and independent system operators may also retroactively reprice transactions following execution. \n\nSubject to certain regulatory constraints, the Evergy Companies use derivative instruments, such as transmission congestion rights (TCRs), swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks. Losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, if a counterparty fails to perform or if the underlying transactions, which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge, fail to materialize. The valuation of these financial instruments can involve management&#8217;s judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. The Evergy Companies cannot assure that their risk management practices will be effective or will mitigate all risks. \n\nThe results of operations, financial position and liquidity of the Evergy Companies could be materially adversely affected if the Evergy Companies fail to recover, or experience a delay in the recovery of, fuel and purchased power expenses; if the Evergy Companies fail to adequately hedge or mitigate commodity or energy market risks; if the Evergy Companies are required to provide collateral in amounts greater than planned; if energy marketing transactions are retroactively repriced; or if counterparties fail to fulfill obligations to the Evergy Companies. \n\nTax legislation and an inability to utilize tax credits could adversely impact results of operations, financial position and liquidity. \n\nTax laws and regulations can adversely affect, among other things, financial results, liquidity, credit ratings and the valuation of assets, such as deferred income tax assets. The Evergy Companies regularly assess their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of net operating loss (NOL), tax credit and other tax carryforwards, that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on their balance sheets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary. A reduction in, or disallowance of, these tax benefits could have an adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of the Evergy Companies. \n\nAdditionally, changes in corporate tax rates or policy changes, as well as any inability to generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all tax benefits before they expire, could have an adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and liquidity of the Evergy Companies. In addition, the Evergy Companies construct and operate renewable energy facilities that generate tax credits that reduce federal income tax obligations. The amount of tax credits is dependent on several factors, including the amount of electricity produced and the applicable tax credit rate. A variety of factors, including transmission constraints, the ability to timely complete construction of renewable energy facilities, adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce these tax credits, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial position of the Evergy Companies. \n\nThe anticipated benefits of the Evergy Companies' strategy may not be realized. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' strategy includes significant planned reductions in operating and maintenance expense and significant planned increases in capital investments. The Evergy Companies' strategy also includes a different mix of capital investments than has been pursued in the past, including significant capital investments in renewable generation. The Evergy Companies' strategy also includes the planned retirement of coal-fired generation resources. If regulators determine that the retirement of coal generation facilities was not prudent, they could prohibit the Evergy Companies from recovering, or earning a return on, the investments in those facilities that were prudent when the investments were originally made. This concept is known as a \"stranded asset,\" and generation retirements outside of those contemplated in the integrated resource plan increase the risk that regulators will disallow the recovery of otherwise prudent investments. In addition, the Evergy Companies may utilize legislative mechanisms known as securitization to facilitate the retirement of coal-fired generation, which will eliminate future returns on the investment that was originally made by the Evergy Companies in those coal-fired generating facilities and reduce the Evergy's Companies results of operations and financial position. \n\nNo assurance can be given that the Evergy Companies will be successful in implementing their strategy in a timely manner or at all, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial \n\nposition and cash flows of the Evergy Companies and have an adverse impact on the price of Evergy&#8217;s common stock. \n\nThe price of Evergy common stock may experience volatility. \n\nThe price of Evergy common stock may be volatile. Some of the factors that could affect the price of Evergy common stock are Evergy's earnings; the ability of the Evergy Companies to implement their strategic plan; the ability of Evergy to deploy capital; actions by regulators; and statements in the press or investment community about the Evergy Companies' strategy, earnings per share or growth prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Negative perceptions or publicity from increasing scrutiny of environmental, social and governance practices could also adversely impact Evergy's stock price. Also, individuals or entities, such as activist shareholders and special interest groups, may seek to influence the Evergy Companies' strategic plan or take other actions that could disrupt the Evergy Companies' business, financial results or operations and could adversely impact Evergy's stock price. In addition, the Evergy Companies operate almost exclusively in Kansas and Missouri and this concentration may increase exposure to risks arising from unique local or regional factors. Furthermore, domestic and international market conditions and economic factors and political events unrelated to the performance of Evergy (including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict) may also affect Evergy's stock price. For these reasons, shareholders should not rely on historical trends in the price of Evergy common stock to predict the future price of Evergy's common stock. \n\nEvergy has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results . \n\nAs required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Evergy recorded a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet in connection with completion of the merger that resulted in the formation of Evergy. Evergy assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential for impairment. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, Evergy may be required to incur non-cash charges that could materially adversely affect its results of operations. \n\nCustomer and Weather-Related Risks: \n\nChanges in electricity consumption could have a material adverse effect on Evergy's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nChange in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the consumption of energy by customers. Federal and state programs exist to influence the way customers use energy and regulators have mandates to promote energy efficiency. Conservation programs and customers' level of participation in the programs could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nTechnological advances, energy efficiency and other energy conservation measures have reduced and will continue to reduce customer electricity consumption. The Evergy Companies generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost. Self-generation and distributed generation technologies, including microturbines, wind turbines, fuel cells and solar cells, as well as those related to the storage of energy produced by these systems, have become economically competitive with the manner and price at which the Evergy Companies sell electricity. There is also a perception that generating or storing electricity through these technologies is more environmentally friendly than generating electricity with fossil fuels. Increased adoption of these technologies could reduce electricity demand and the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered, resulting in under recovery of the fixed costs of the Evergy Companies. Increased self-generation and the related use of net energy metering, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power, could put upward price pressure on remaining customers. If the Evergy Companies are unable to adjust to reduced electricity demand and increased self-generation and net energy metering, their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\nChanges in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions, downturns or sluggishness in the economy or other factors may also adversely affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nWeather is a major driver of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies and the Evergy Companies are subject to risks associated with climate change. \n\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for and price of electricity. The Evergy Companies are significantly impacted by seasonality, and, due to energy demand created by air conditioning load, highest revenues are typically recorded in the third quarter. Unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales. In addition, severe weather and events, including tornados, snow, fire, rain, flooding, drought and ice storms, can be destructive and cause outages and property damage that can result in increased expenses, lower revenues and additional restoration costs. Storm reserves established by the Evergy Companies may be insufficient and rates may not be adjusted in a timely manner, or at all, to recover these costs. Additionally, because many of the Evergy Companies' generating stations utilize water for cooling, low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations, result in limited power production and require modifications to plant operations. High water conditions can also impair planned deliveries of fuel to generating stations or otherwise adversely impact the ability of the Evergy Companies to operate these stations. Climate change may produce more frequent or severe weather events, such as storms, droughts or floods. These events could lead to unforeseen changes in water supply quality and create additional costs related to water treatment and complying with environmental discharge requirements. Climate change events could also impact the economic health of the Evergy Companies' service territories. An increase in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events or a deterioration in the economic health of the Evergy Companies' service territories could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nIn addition, policy, legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change, such as efforts to reduce GHG emissions, impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for low-carbon generation and energy efficiency, could result in reduced sales and require significant costs to respond to such efforts. These efforts could also result in the early retirement of generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow recovery of investments that were prudent when originally made and included in rates. Evergy has a goal to achieve net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2045 with an interim goal of a 70% reduction of CO 2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The trajectory and timing of reaching the net-zero goal are dependent on many external factors, including enabling technology developments, the reliability of the power grid, availability of transmission capacity, supportive energy policies and regulations, and other factors. These external factors are outside of Evergy's control, and without these enabling factors Evergy cannot be confident in achieving its net-zero carbon reduction goal. In addition, any of the foregoing could adversely affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies and the market prices of Evergy's common stock. \n\nNew climate disclosure rules proposed by the SEC may increase the Evergy Companies' costs of compliance and adversely impact their business. \n\nOn March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks. The Evergy Companies are currently assessing the proposed rule, but at this time they cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the rule. To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, the Evergy Companies could incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks. The Evergy Companies may also face increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rule if finalized as proposed. In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of certain stakeholders and lenders restricting or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in certain carbon-intensive sectors. \n\nOperational Risks: \n\nOperational risks may adversely affect the Evergy Companies. \n\nThe operation of electric generation, transmission, distribution and information systems involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment; aging infrastructure; employee error or contractor or subcontractor failure; problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages; limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental, safety or other regulatory requirements; fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions; labor disputes; difficulties with the implementation or operation of information systems; transmission scheduling constraints; and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, droughts, \n\nexplosions, terrorism or acts of war, severe weather, pandemics or other similar occurrences. Many of the Evergy Companies' generation, transmission and distribution resources are aged, which increases the risk of unplanned outages, reduced generation output and higher maintenance expense. Any equipment or system outage or constraint can, among other things, reduce sales, increase costs and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics, customer expectations and regulatory reliability and security requirements. \n\nThe Evergy Companies have general liability and property insurance to cover a portion of their facilities, but such policies do not cover transmission or distribution systems, are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage. Certain insurers are also choosing to limit their exposure to companies with coal-fired generation, which may result in increased premiums and reduced scope of coverage. These and other operating events may reduce revenues or increase costs, or both, and may materially affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nPhysical and cybersecurity breaches, criminal activity, terrorist attacks, acts of war and other disruptions to facilities or information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, expose the Evergy Companies or their customers or employees to a risk of loss, expose the Evergy Companies to legal or regulatory liability and cause reputational and other harm. \n\nThe Evergy Companies rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, supply chain functions and the invoicing and collection of payments from customers. The Evergy Companies also use information technology networks and systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. These networks and systems are in some cases owned or managed by third-party service providers. In the ordinary course of business, the Evergy Companies collect, store and transmit sensitive data including operating information, proprietary business information and personal information belonging to customers and employees. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' information technology networks and infrastructure, as well as the networks and infrastructure belonging to third-party service providers, are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other unauthorized third parties; error or malfeasance by employees, contractors or service providers; unintended consequences related to software or hardware upgrades, additions or replacements; malicious software code; vulnerabilities in third-party software code; telecommunication failures; the lack of availability of qualified employees and contractors; natural disasters or other catastrophic events; or criminal activity, terrorist attacks or acts of war. Driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Evergy Companies have adopted the use of technology to enable remote-working arrangements, which may increase or expose previously unknown vulnerabilities. Public reports have indicated an increase in cyberattacks in general since the start of the pandemic due, in part, to the increase in the number of employees working remotely and the proliferation of the different ways in which people interact with their information technology infrastructure. \n\nThe occurrence of any of these events could, among other things, impact the reliability or safety of the Evergy Companies' generation, transmission and distribution systems and information systems; result in the erasure of data or render the Evergy Companies' equipment, or the equipment of third-party service providers, unusable; impact the Evergy Companies' ability to conduct business in the ordinary course; reduce sales; expose the Evergy Companies and their customers, employees and vendors to a risk of loss or misuse of information; result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties; damage the Evergy Companies' reputation; or otherwise harm the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Evergy Companies can provide no assurance that they will be able to identify and remediate all security or system vulnerabilities or that unauthorized access or error will be identified and remediated. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning cybersecurity and safeguarding their customer and business information. For example, NERC has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of the bulk power system, including both \n\nphysical and cybersecurity, and continually evaluates the necessity for updates and new requirements with which the Evergy Companies must comply. The Evergy Companies are subject to recurring, independent, third-party audits with respect to adherence to these regulations and standards. The NRC also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at nuclear power plants. Compliance with NERC and NRC rules and standards, and rules and standards promulgated by other regulatory agencies from time to time or future legislation, will increase the Evergy Companies' compliance costs and their exposure to the potential risk of violations of these rules, standards or future legislation, which includes potential financial penalties. Furthermore, the non-compliance by other utilities subject to similar regulations or the occurrence of a serious security event at other utilities could result in increased regulation or oversight, both of which could increase the Evergy Companies' costs and adversely impact their financial results. \n\nAdditionally, the Evergy Companies cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or malicious attack may have on the energy industry in general. The electric utility industry, both within the United States and internationally, has experienced physical and cybersecurity attacks on energy infrastructure such as power plants, substations and related assets in the past, and there will likely be more attacks in the future. Geopolitical matters, including terrorist attacks and acts of war, may increase the likelihood of such attacks. The Evergy Companies have been subject to attempted cyber attacks from time to time, and will likely continue to be subject to such attempted attacks, but these prior attacks have not had a material impact on their operations. However, because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on the Evergy Companies in the future. The Evergy Companies' facilities and systems could be direct targets or indirect casualties of such attacks. The effects of such attacks could include disruption to the Evergy Companies' generation, transmission and distribution, and information systems or to the electrical grid in general, reduced sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage. Furthermore, although the Evergy Companies maintain information security risk insurance coverage, such insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nThe cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' business is capital intensive and includes significant construction projects. The risks of any capital project include: actual costs may exceed estimated costs; regulators may disallow, limit or delay the recovery of all or part of the cost of, or a return on, a capital project; increased inflation may render previously estimated costs to be inaccurate; risks associated with the capital and credit markets to fund projects; delays in receiving, or failure to receive, necessary permits, approvals and other regulatory authorizations; unforeseen engineering problems or changes in project design or scope; the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts; inadequate availability or increased cost of labor or materials, including commodities such as steel, copper and aluminum that may be subject to uncertain or increased tariffs; inclement weather; new or changed laws, regulations and requirements, including environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements; and other events beyond the Evergy Companies' control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' strategy includes a significant amount of planned capital investments. The Evergy Companies' ability to implement these investments depend, in part, on the availability of adequate internal and external resources, such as employees and qualified contractors and the availability of materials. In this regard, the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to the global supply chain and the availability of qualified labor, which, in turn, has increased inflationary pressures. \n\nThese and other risks could cause the Evergy Companies to defer or limit capital expenditures, materially increase the costs of capital projects, delay the in-service dates of projects, adversely affect the performance of the projects and require the purchase of electricity on the wholesale market, at potentially more expensive prices, until the projects are completed. These risks may significantly affect the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce or to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact the Evergy Companies' business and operations and adversely impact the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' workforce includes professional, managerial and technical employees. Failure to attract and retain qualified talent, successfully transition retirements with adequate replacements, or source qualified contractors could impede the Evergy Companies' strategy and/or adversely impact the Evergy Companies' ability to execute on their strategy. For example, certain skills, such as those related to construction, maintenance and repair of transmission and distribution systems are in high demand and have a limited supply. Evergy competes for qualified employees with these skills on a national level. \n\nA significant portion of the Evergy Companies' workforce is represented by five local unions of the IBEW and one local union of the UGSOA. The Evergy Companies currently have labor agreements with each of these unions that expire at varying times in 2024 through 2026. A failure to successfully negotiate these collective bargaining agreements could result in a labor disruption and have a significant adverse impact on the Evergy Companies' operations and results of operations. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' strategic plan includes enhanced technology and transmission and distribution investments and a reduction in reliance on coal-fired generation. The Evergy Companies will need to attract and retain personnel that are qualified to implement the Evergy Companies' strategy and may need to retrain or reskill certain employees to support the Evergy Companies' long-term objectives. A failure to attract and retain qualified employees, retrain or reskill existing employees and maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, which could adversely impact the Evergy Companies' business and financial results. \n\nEvergy indirectly owns 94% of Wolf Creek, with Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro each owning 47% of the nuclear plant. Such ownership exposes the Evergy Companies to various risks unique to the nuclear industry. Damages, decommissioning or other costs could exceed the Evergy Companies' ability to recover such costs through rates or other mechanisms such as decommissioning trust assets or through external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including Wolf Creek. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down the facilities, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Additionally, the non-compliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry. Such events could increase Wolf Creek's costs and impact the financial results of the Evergy Companies or result in a shutdown of Wolf Creek. \n\nAn extended outage of Wolf Creek, whether resulting from NRC action, an incident at the plant or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies in the event replacement power, damages, and other costs exceed or are not recovered through rates, insurance or decommissioning trust assets. If a long-term outage occurred, the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the Wolf Creek investment from rate base. Wolf Creek commenced operations in 1985 and the age of Wolf Creek may increase the risk of unplanned outages and may result in higher maintenance costs. \n\nOn an annual basis, Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro are required to contribute money to tax-qualified trusts that were established to pay for decommissioning costs at the end of the unit's life. The amount of contributions varies depending on estimates of decommissioning expenses and projected return on trust assets. If the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated, Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, including, but not limited to, (i) potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on \n\nthe environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit, (ii) the storage, handling, disposal and potential release (by accident, through third-party actions or otherwise) of radioactive materials and (iii) uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate. Under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units, Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro are also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments (subject to a cap) per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage. \n\nIn addition, Wolf Creek is reliant on a sole supplier for fuel and related services. The supplier has in the past been the subject of Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings, and an extended outage of Wolf Creek could occur if the supplier is not able to perform under its contracts with Wolf Creek. Switching to another supplier could take an extended amount of time and would require NRC approval. An extended outage at Wolf Creek could affect the amount of Wolf Creek investment included in customer rates and could have a material impact on the Evergy Companies' financial results. \n\nThe structure of the regional power market in which the Evergy Companies operate could have an adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are members of the SPP regional transmission organization, and each has transferred operational authority (but not ownership) of their transmission facilities to the SPP. The SPP's Integrated Marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time. The SPP's rules are primarily designed to provide for maximum cost-effectiveness, but in certain respects the rules also provide preferential treatment for certain resources based on public policy initiatives, such as increasing the deployment of renewable generation. If Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's or Evergy Missouri West's generating resources are not dispatched, each could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' strategic plan includes adding a significant amount of renewable generation. Transmission constraints and delays in the transmission planning and construction processes could impair the ability of the Evergy Companies to sell and transmit electricity generated by these renewable generation facilities, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial position of the Evergy Companies. \n\nIn addition, the rules governing the various regional power markets, including the SPP, may change from time to time and such changes could impact the costs and revenues of the Evergy Companies. \n\nLitigation Risks: \n\nThe outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted. An adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their respective businesses. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from each case be reasonably estimated. The liability that the Evergy Companies may incur with respect to any of these cases may be in excess of amounts currently accrued and insured against with respect to such matters and could adversely impact the financial results for the Evergy Companies. \n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Risks: \n\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to risks relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters that could adversely affect their reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to a variety of risks, including reputational risk, associated with ESG issues. The public holds diverse and often conflicting views on ESG topics. The Evergy Companies have multiple stakeholders, including their shareholders, customers, associates, federal and state regulatory authorities and the communities in which they operate, and these stakeholders will often have differing priorities and expectations regarding ESG issues. If the Evergy Companies take action in conflict with one or another of those stakeholders' expectations, they could experience an increase in customer complaints, a loss of business or reputational harm. The Evergy Companies could also face negative publicity or reputational harm based on the identity of those with \n\nwhom they choose to do business. Any adverse publicity in connection with ESG issues could damage their reputation, ability to attract new customers and retain employees, compete effectively and grow their business. \n\nIn addition, proxy advisory firms and certain institutional investors who manage investments in public companies are increasingly integrating ESG factors into their investment analysis. The consideration of ESG factors in making investment and voting decisions is relatively new. Accordingly, the frameworks and methods for assessing ESG policies are not fully developed, vary considerably among the investment community and will likely continue to evolve over time. Moreover, the subjective nature of methods used by various stakeholders to assess a company with respect to ESG criteria could result in erroneous perceptions or a misrepresentation of the Evergy Companies' actual ESG policies and practices. Organizations that provide ratings information to investors on ESG matters may also assign unfavorable ratings to the Evergy Companies. If the Evergy Companies fail to comply with specific ESG-related investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, or to provide the disclosure relating to ESG issues that any third parties may believe is necessary or appropriate (regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so), their reputation, business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be negatively impacted. \n\n"

Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central consolidate the leasing entity as a variable interest entity (VIE). See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. \n\n(j) Although the plant was completed in 1969, a new boiler, air quality control equipment and an uprated turbine were placed in service at the Hawthorn Generating Station in 2001. \n\nTransmission and Distribution Resources \n\nEvergy's electric transmission system interconnects with systems of other utilities for reliability and to permit wholesale transactions with other electricity suppliers. Evergy has approximately 10,100 circuit miles of transmission lines, 44,900 circuit miles of overhead distribution lines and 15,800 circuit miles of underground distribution lines in Missouri and Kansas. Evergy has all material franchise rights necessary to sell electricity within its retail service territory. Evergy's transmission and distribution systems are routinely monitored for adequacy to meet customer needs. Management believes the current system has adequate capacity to serve customers. \n\nGeneral \n\nEvergy's generating plants are located on property owned (or co-owned) by the Evergy Companies, except for certain facilities that are located on easements or are contractually controlled. Evergy's headquarters, service centers, electric substations and a portion of its transmission and distribution systems are located on property owned or leased by Evergy. Evergy's transmission and distribution systems are for the most part located above or underneath highways, streets, other public places or property owned by others. Evergy believes that it has satisfactory rights to use those places or properties in the form of permits, grants, easements, licenses or franchise rights; however, it has not necessarily undertaken efforts to examine the underlying title to the land upon which the rights rest. \n\nSubstantially all of the fixed property and franchises of the Evergy Companies, which consist principally of electric generating stations, electric transmission and distribution lines and systems, and buildings (subject to exceptions, reservations and releases), are subject to mortgage indentures pursuant to which bonds have been issued and are outstanding.

None of the registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central or Evergy Metro other than itself. The following MD&#38;A generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 can be found in MD&#38;A in Part II, Item 7, of the Evergy Companies' combined annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Year-to-year comparisons of Evergy's gross margin (GAAP) and Evergy's utility gross margin (non-GAAP) between 2021 and 2020 can be found in the Evergy Results of Operations section within this MD&#38;A. \n\nEVERGY, INC. \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nEvergy is a public utility holding company incorporated in 2017 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Kansas Central is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas. Evergy Kansas Central has one active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Metro is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Missouri West is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Transmission Company owns 13.5% of Transource with the remaining 86.5% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of AEP. Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects. Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central also owns a 50% interest in Prairie Wind, which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. Prairie Wind owns a 108-mile, 345 kV double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the SPP. Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy. Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately 15,400 MWs of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 1.7 million customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri. The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment). \n\nStrategy \n\nEvergy expects to continue operating its integrated utilities within the currently existing regulatory frameworks and is focused on empowering a better future for its customers, communities, employees and shareholders. The core tenets of Evergy's strategy are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Affordability - operating the business cost-effectively and investing in technology and infrastructure to keep rates affordable and improve regional rate competitiveness; mitigating fuel and purchased power volatility by investing in a diverse generation fleet; \n\n&#8226; Reliability - targeting transmission and distribution infrastructure investment to support reliability, flexibility, public safety, and resiliency; deploying new technology to improve preventive maintenance and customer restoration times; and \n\n&#8226; Sustainability - investing at sustainable capital expenditure levels to maintain reliability and customer affordability for the long-term and balancing clean energy investment to continue fuel diversification and enable a responsible generation portfolio transition. \n\nSignificant elements of Evergy's plan to achieve its strategic objectives include: \n\n&#8226; targeting ongoing reductions of operating and maintenance expense consistent with savings already achieved since the 2018 merger of Evergy Kansas Central and Great Plains Energy; \n\n&#8226; targeting approximately $11.6 billion of expected base capital investments through 2027 including new generation of approximately $2.1 billion which is expected to be primarily renewable generation. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources; Capital Expenditures\", for further information regarding Evergy's projected capital expenditures through 2027; and \n\n&#8226; targeting a 70% reduction of CO 2 emissions by 2030 (from 2005 levels) and net-zero by 2045 through the continued growth of Evergy's renewable energy portfolio and the retirement of older and less efficient fossil fuel plants. See \"Transitioning Evergy's Generation Fleet\" in Part I, Item 1., Business, for additional information. \n\nSee \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\" and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. \n\nSibley Station \n\nEvergy Missouri West retired its Sibley Station in 2018 and the retirement of Sibley Unit 3 met the criteria to be considered an abandonment. Evergy has classified the remaining net book value of Sibley Unit 3 as retired generation facilities within regulatory assets on its consolidated balance sheet. In October 2019, the MPSC issued an AAO requiring Evergy Missouri West to defer to a regulatory liability all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, taxes including accumulated deferred income taxes and all other costs associated with Sibley Station following its retirement in November 2018 to be considered in Evergy Missouri West's 2022 rate case. \n\nIn January 2022, Evergy Missouri West filed an application with the MPSC requesting an increase to its retail revenues including the full return of and return on its unrecovered investment related to the 2018 retirement of Sibley Station. In December 2022, the MPSC issued an amended final rate order which addressed the treatment of Evergy Missouri West's unrecovered investment in Sibley Station. The order determined that Evergy Missouri West will be allowed to collect $182.3 million ($173.6 million attributable to Sibley Unit 3) from customers over a period of eight years as a recovery of its existing investment in Sibley Station but will not be allowed to collect the return on its unrecovered investment in Sibley Station. The order also required Evergy Missouri West to refund to customers all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs and other costs associated with Sibley Station following its retirement in November 2018 over a period of four years. \n\nAs a result of the amended final order, Evergy recorded a $68.0 million reduction to operating revenues on its consolidated statements of comprehensive income in 2022 and a corresponding increase to its Sibley AAO regulatory liability for revenues collected from customers for return on investment in Sibley Station since December 2018, which had not previously been recorded as they were not determined to be probable of refund, and a $26.7 million impairment loss on Sibley Unit 3. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining net book value of Sibley Unit 3 was $146.3 million, which is representative of the $173.6 million unrecovered investment in Sibley Unit 3 determined by the MPSC in its December 2022 order less the 2022 impairment loss recorded and other amortization expense. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy's Sibley AAO regulatory liability was $108.0 million. See \"Abandoned Plant\" in Note 1 and \"Evergy Missouri West Other Proceedings\" in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central FERC Transmission Formula Rate (TFR) Refund \n\nIn December 2022, FERC issued an order upholding in part, and denying in part, a formal challenge of Evergy Kansas Central's TFR by certain customers. As a result of this order, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central recorded a $32.8 million decrease to operating revenues on their consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for 2022 for the deferral to a regulatory liability of the estimated refund of TFR revenue over-collections related to the calculation of Evergy Kansas Central's capital structure for rate years 2018 - 2022. Evergy Kansas Central currently expects that the refund of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 over-collections will occur as part of its 2023 TFR, subject to an approval by FERC. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n\nEvergy Missouri West February 2021 Winter Weather Event Securitization \n\nIn February 2021, much of the central and southern United States, including the service territories of the Evergy Companies, experienced a significant winter weather event that resulted in extremely cold temperatures over a multi-day period (February 2021 winter weather event). See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In March 2022, Evergy Missouri West filed a petition for a financing order with the MPSC requesting authorization to finance its extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event, including carrying costs, through the issuance of securitized bonds. Evergy Missouri West requested to repay the securitized bonds and collect the related amounts from customers over a period of approximately 15 years from the date of issuance of the securitized bonds. \n\nIn November 2022, the MPSC issued a revised financing order authorizing Evergy Missouri West to issue securitized bonds to recover its extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event. As part of the order, the MPSC found that Evergy Missouri West's costs were prudently incurred, that it should only be allowed to recover 95% of its extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs consistent with the 5% sharing provision of its fuel recovery mechanism, that it should be allowed to recover carrying costs incurred since February 2021 at Evergy Missouri West's long-term debt rate of 5.06% and approved a 15 year repayment period for the bonds with a 17 year legal maturity. In the third quarter of 2022, Evergy Missouri West recorded an increase of $15.0 million to its February 2021 winter weather event regulatory asset for the recovery of carrying charges granted in the MPSC's financing order. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the value of Evergy Missouri West's February 2021 winter weather event regulatory asset was $309.0 million and $281.6 million, respectively. Evergy Missouri West will continue to record carrying charges on its February 2021 winter weather event regulatory asset until it issues the securitized bonds. \n\nIn January 2023, the OPC filed an appeal with the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, challenging the financing order regarding the treatment of income tax deductions, carrying costs and discount rates related to the financing of the extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event. A final nonappealable financing order is required prior to the issuance of securitized bonds. A decision by the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, is currently expected in the second half of 2023, though the timeline for the decision is uncertain. \n\nInflation Reduction Act \n\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law by President Biden. The IRA extends tax credits for renewable energy technologies intended to reduce the impacts of climate change. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) have been extended or reinstated for certain renewable energy projects beginning before January 1, 2025. The definition of property eligible for the ITC has been expanded to include standalone energy storage with a capacity of at least 5kWh. Both tax credits make a bonus credit available if certain prevailing wage, apprenticeship and domestic content requirements are met. The IRA modified and extended the Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit to include property placed in service before December 31, 2032 and it also removes the limitation per location. The IRA created a Nuclear Power Production Tax Credit for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2032. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, certain renewable energy tax credits may be transferred to third parties. The IRA also implemented a new 15% corporate minimum tax based on modified GAAP net income and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. \n\nThe Evergy Companies anticipate utilizing the PTC and ITC for future renewable generation projects and are evaluating the Nuclear Power Production Tax Credit in connection with operations at Wolf Creek. The new corporate minimum tax and excise tax on stock buybacks are not expected to have a material impact on the Evergy Companies' operations or consolidated financial results and the Evergy Companies continue to evaluate the remaining IRA provisions for the effect on their future financial results. \n\nMissouri Property Tax Tracker \n\nIn June 2022, Missouri Senate Bill (S.B.) 745 was signed into law by the Governor of Missouri and became effective in August 2022. Among other items, S.B. 745 includes a provision requiring Missouri electric utilities to defer to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, as appropriate, any difference between state or local property tax expenses incurred and the amounts included in rates. Any amounts deferred to a regulatory asset or liability under this provision would be included in the electric utility's revenue requirement in subsequent rate cases and recovered over a reasonable period of time to be determined by the MPSC. Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West began deferring the amounts associated with S.B. 745 in the third quarter of 2022. \n\nRenewable Generation Investment \n\nIn August 2022, Evergy Missouri West entered into an agreement with a renewable energy development company to purchase for approximately $250 million an operational wind farm located in the state of Oklahoma with a generating capacity of approximately 199 MW. The purchase is subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the granting of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) by the MPSC. In January 2023, the MPSC staff recommended the MPSC reject Evergy Missouri West's application for a CCN and allow it to file a new application with updated economic analyses of the renewable generation investment or alternatively extend the procedural schedule to allow the MPSC staff time to evaluate the current economic analyses prepared by Evergy Missouri West. A final decision by the MPSC is expected in the first half of 2023. \n\nRegulatory Proceedings \n\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding regulatory proceedings. \n\nWolf Creek Refueling Outage \n\nWolf Creek's most recent refueling outage began in October 2022 and the unit returned to service in November 2022. Wolf Creek's next refueling outage is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2024. \n\nEarnings Overview \n\nThe following table summarizes Evergy's net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS). \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Change 2021 (millions, except per share amounts) Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. $ 752.7 $ (127.0) $ 879.7 Earnings per common share, diluted 3.27 (0.56) 3.83 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc. decreased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to non-regulated energy marketing margins related to the February 2021 winter weather event, an impairment loss and other regulatory disallowances related to Evergy Missouri West's and Evergy Metro's final rate order received from the MPSC in December 2022, lower realized and unrealized gains from various equity investments, higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense, the ordered refund to customers of certain transmission revenues and the recording of an estimated refund obligation to customers related to Evergy Metro's Earnings Review and Sharing Plan (ERSP); partially offset by higher retail sales in 2022 driven by favorable weather and higher weather-normalized demand, lower income tax expense, higher transmission revenue and higher interest income. \n\nDiluted EPS decreased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to the decrease in net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. discussed above. \n\nFor additional information regarding the change in net income, refer to the Evergy Results of Operations section within this MD&#38;A. \n\nNon-GAAP Measures \n\nEvergy Utility Gross Margin (non-GAAP) \n\nUtility gross margin (non-GAAP) is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Utility gross margin (non-GAAP), as used by the Evergy Companies, is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs. Expenses for fuel and purchased power costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms. As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income. In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by SPP members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO. As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income. The Evergy Companies' definition of utility gross margin (non-GAAP) may differ from similar terms used by other companies. \n\nUtility gross margin (non-GAAP) is intended to aid an investor's overall understanding of results. Management believes that utility gross margin (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the Evergy Companies' operations across periods because utility gross margin (non-GAAP) excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs and SPP network transmission costs. Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and Evergy's Board of Directors (Evergy Board). Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, gross margin, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Gross margin under GAAP is defined as the excess of sales over cost of goods sold. \n\nUtility gross margin (non-GAAP) differs from the GAAP definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance expenses determined to be directly attributable to revenue-producing activities, depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income tax. See the Evergy Companies' Results of Operations for a reconciliation of utility gross margin (non-GAAP) to gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure. \n\nAdjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) \n\nEffective in the third quarter of 2022, the calculation of adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) excludes the revenues collected from customers for the return on investment of the retired Sibley Station in the current period and the 2022 deferral of the cumulative amount of revenues collected since December 2018 to be refunded to customers. See \"Sibley Station\" within this Executive Summary for additional information. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, the calculation of adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) excludes the transmission revenues collected from customers in the current period and the 2022 deferral of the cumulative amount of transmission revenues collected since 2018 through Evergy Kansas Central's FERC TFR to be refunded to customers as a result of a December 2022 FERC order. See \"Evergy Kansas Central FERC TFR Refund\" within this Executive Summary for additional information. Management believes that this is a representative measure of Evergy's recurring earnings, assists in the comparability of results and is consistent with how management reviews performance. Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) for 2021 have been recast, as applicable, to conform to the current year presentation. \n\nEvergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) for 2022 were $853.8 million or $3.71 per share. For 2021, Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) were $795.2 million or $3.46 per share. \n\nIn addition to net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. and diluted EPS, Evergy's management uses adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) to evaluate earnings and EPS without i.) the income or costs resulting from non-regulated energy marketing margins from the February 2021 winter weather event; ii.) gains or losses related to equity investments subject to a restriction on sale; iii.) the revenues collected from customers for the return on investment of the retired Sibley Station in the current period and the 2022 deferral of the cumulative amount of revenues collected since December 2018 for future refunds to customers; iv.) the estimated impairment loss on Sibley Unit 3 and other regulatory disallowances; v.) the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges related to Evergy Kansas Central's non-regulated 8% ownership share of Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC); vi.) the transmission revenues collected from customers through Evergy Kansas Central's FERC TFR to be refunded to customers in accordance with a December 2022 FERC order; and vii.) costs resulting from executive transition, severance, advisor expenses and COVID-19 vaccine incentives. \n\nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are intended to aid an investor's overall understanding of results. Management believes that adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for evaluating Evergy's operations across periods because it excludes certain items that management does not believe are indicative of Evergy's ongoing perf ormance or that can create period to period earnings volatility. \n\nAd justed earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. \n\n##TABLE_START Earnings (Loss) Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share Earnings (Loss) Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share 2022 2021 (millions, except per share amounts) Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. $ 752.7 $ 3.27 $ 879.7 $ 3.83 Non-GAAP reconciling items: Non-regulated energy marketing margin related to February 2021 \n\nwinter weather event, pre-tax (a) \n\n2.1 0.01 (94.5) (0.41) Sibley Station return on investment, pre-tax (b) \n\n51.4 0.22 (12.4) (0.05) Mark-to-market impact of JEC economic hedges, pre-tax (c) \n\n(11.2) (0.05) &#8212;

Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been used, could have a material impact on Evergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of Evergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Evergy Board. \n\nPensions \n\nEvergy incurs significant costs in providing non-contributory defined pension benefits. The costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience. \n\nPension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, life expectancies, compensation levels and employment periods), earnings on plan assets, the level of contributions made to the plan, and plan amendments. In addition, pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. \n\nThe assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted-average of long-term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan. The assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation. These assumptions, updated annually at the measurement date, are based on management's best estimates and judgment; however, material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs. \n\nThe following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease in key actuarial assumptions for Evergy's qualified pension plans. Each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only. \n\n##TABLE_START Impact on Impact on Projected 2023 Change in Benefit Pension Actuarial assumption Assumption Obligation Expense (millions) Discount rate 0.5 % increase $ (76.4) $ (6.7) Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 % increase N/A (5.9) Rate of compensation 0.5 % increase 16.9 3.5 Discount rate 0.5 % decrease 84.7 7.3 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 % decrease N/A 5.9 Rate of compensation 0.5 % decrease (15.8) (3.3) ##TABLE_END\n\nPension expense for Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC. The orders allow the difference between pension costs under GAAP and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds, as appropriate. \n\nIn 2022, Evergy's pension expense was $144.5 million under GAAP and $159.2 million for ratemaking. The impact on 2023 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on GAAP pension costs. Under the Evergy Companies' rate agreements, any increase or decrease in GAAP pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions. \n\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan. It is difficult to predict future pension costs, changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nEvergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice. Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by Evergy. Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month. This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs. Evergy's estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates. Evergy's unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the balance of unbilled receivables for Evergy as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities \n\nEvergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues. Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers. \n\nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to Evergy; and changes in laws and regulations. If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations. Evergy's continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules. In the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of Evergy's operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided. Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n\nImpairments of Assets and Goodwill \n\nLong-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP. \n\nAccounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. Evergy's consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. The annual impairment test for the $2,336.6 million of goodwill from \n\nthe Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger was conducted as of May 1, 2022. The fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill. \n\nThe determination of fair value for the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit, which involves a significant amount of management judgment. \n\nThe discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions: estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows. Management determines the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the KCC and MPSC and after-tax cost of debt. Estimated future cash flows are based on Evergy's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of return on equity, anticipated returns of and earnings on future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts. Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of the Evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill. \n\nThe market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management's selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit, as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock. Management determines an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry. Changes in results of peer companies, selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the Evergy reporting unit. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards. Evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in Evergy's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities. This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ. Evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\nEvergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective is also recorded to property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability. \n\nEvergy initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (94% indirect share), retire wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills, among other items. ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. In determining Evergy's AROs, assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence. The results of these assumptions are discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates (CARFR). The CARFR is determined as the current U.S. Treasury bonds rates corresponding to the period of expected settlement activities and is adjusted for the associated bond rates Evergy would be charged to borrow for the specific time period. Any change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on Evergy's AROs reflected on its consolidated balance sheets. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Evergy had recorded AROs of $1,153.2 million and $960.1 million, respectively. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's AROs. \n\nEVERGY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#160; \n\nEvergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation, fuel costs, weather, customer behavior and demand, the economy and competitive forces. \n\nSubstantially all of Evergy's revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a significant impact on the price the Evergy Companies charge for electric service. Evergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending, both operating and capital, within the frameworks established by its regulators and to mitigate the impacts of inflationary pressures. \n\nWholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather. \n\nThe Evergy Companies use coal, uranium and gas for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power through renewable power purchase agreements or on the open market. The prices for fuel used in generation or the market price of power purchases can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply, demand, weather and the broader economic environment. Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have fuel recovery mechanisms in their Kansas and Missouri jurisdictions, as applicable, that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding. \n\nWeather significantly affects the amount of electricity that Evergy's customers use as electricity sales are seasonal. As summer peaking utilities, the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the Evergy Companies. Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers. Mild weather reduces customer demand. \n\nEnergy efficiency investments by customers and the Evergy Companies also can affect the demand for electric service. Through MEEIA, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their Missouri retail customers and recover program costs, throughput disincentive, and as applicable, certain earnings opportunities in retail rates through a rider mechanism. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' taxes other than income taxes, of which property taxes are a significant component, can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including changes in taxable values and property tax rates. Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have property tax surcharges or trackers that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in property tax costs from the amounts set in base rates. \n\nThe following table summarizes Evergy's comparative results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Change 2021 &#160; (millions) Operating revenues $ 5,859.1 $ 272.4 $ 5,586.7 Fuel and purchased power 1,821.2 264.2 1,557.0 SPP network transmission costs 323.0 32.6 290.4 Operating and maintenance 1,085.3 (22.2) 1,107.5 Depreciation and amortization 929.4 33.0 896.4 Taxes other than income tax 398.1 17.6 380.5 Sibley Unit 3 impairment loss and other regulatory disallowances 34.9 34.9 &#8212; Income from operations 1,267.2 (87.7) 1,354.9 Other income (expense), net (58.0) (76.8) 18.8 Interest expense 404.0 31.4 372.6 Income tax expense 47.5 (69.9) 117.4 Equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of income taxes \n\n7.3 (0.9) 8.2 Net income 765.0 (126.9) 891.9 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n12.3 0.1 12.2 Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. $ 752.7 $ (127.0) $ 879.7 ##TABLE_END\n\nGross Margin (GAAP) and Utility Gross Margin (non-GAAP) \n\nThe following tables summarize Evergy's gross margin (GAAP) and MWhs sold and reconcile Evergy's gross margin (GAAP) to Evergy's utility gross margin (non-GAAP).

See Notes 1 and 4 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n\nOther Income (Expense), Net \n\nEvergy's other income, net in 2021 became other expense, net, in 2022 as a result of a $76.8 million increase in net other expense items, primarily driven by: \n\n&#8226; a $66.7 million increase primarily due to a $27.7 million unrealized gain in 2021 due to the change in fair value related to Evergy's equity investment in an early-stage energy solutions company, a $16.3 million realized loss related to this equity investment that was sold in 2022 through a share forward agreement, $14.0 million in realized gains from the sale of various equity investments in 2021 and a $9.9 million increase due to lower unrealized gains from various equity investments in 2022; \n\n&#8226; a $7.3 million increase primarily due to higher pension non-service costs at Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro in 2022; \n\n&#8226; $6.4 million of lower Evergy Kansas Central equity allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) primarily driven by higher short-term debt balances in 2022; and \n\n&#8226; $6.1 million of other income recorded in 2021 related to contract termination fees; partially offset by \n\n&#8226; a $20.2 million increase in interest income primarily due to $15.0 million of carrying charges recorded by Evergy Missouri West in the third quarter of 2022 associated with its regulatory asset for fuel and purchased power costs related to the February 2021 winter weather event, driven by an MPSC order allowing for their recovery as part of Evergy Missouri West's securitization financing request. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nEvergy's interest expense increased $31.4 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily driven by: \n\n&#8226; a $42.3 million increase in interest expense on short-term borrowings primarily due to higher short-term debt balances and weighted-average interest rates for Evergy, Inc., Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Missouri West in 2022; and \n\n&#8226; a $7.4 million increase due to the issuance of Evergy Missouri West's $250.0 million of 3.75% First Mortgage Bonds (FMBs) in March 2022; partially offset by \n\n&#8226; an $8.3 million decrease due to the repayment of Evergy's $287.5 million of 5.292% Senior Notes at maturity in June 2022; and \n\n&#8226; a $5.8 million decrease due to the repayment of Evergy Missouri West's $80.9 million of 8.27% Senior Notes at maturity in November 2021. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nEvergy's income tax expense decreased $69.9 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily driven by: \n\n&#8226; a $42.7 million decrease primarily due to lower Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Missouri West pre-tax income in 2022; and \n\n&#8226; a $17.9 million decrease primarily due to higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes authorized by FERC in December 2022. \n\nEVERGY SIGNIFICANT BALANCE SHEET CHANGES \n\n(December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021) \n\n&#8226; Evergy's receivables, net increased $93.7 million primarily driven by a $52.1 million increase in retail electric accounts receivable and a $48.3 million increase in wholesale sales accounts receivable driven by higher sales in December 2022 due to favorable weather. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's accounts receivable pledged as collateral increased $40.0 million primarily driven by Evergy's increase in retail electric accounts receivable balances in December 2022, resulting in a higher level of retail electric receivables available for sale through Evergy's receivable sales facilities. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's fuel and supplies inventory increased $106.2 million primarily driven by an $86.4 million increase in materials and supply inventory primarily due to an increase in transmission and distribution capital projects related to grid resiliency and other infrastructure improvement in addition to maintaining higher overall levels of inventory to mitigate longer supply chain lead times. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's income taxes receivable decreased by $18.7 million primarily due to the application of Evergy's 2021 overpayment of income taxes to Evergy's 2022 income tax payments. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's other assets - current decreased $30.9 million primarily due to a $31.4 million investment in an early-stage energy solutions company that was sold in 2022. See \"Evergy Equity Investment\" in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased $115.4 million primarily driven by realized and unrealized losses on investments at Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's nuclear decommissioning trusts. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's current maturities of long-term debt increased $49.8 million primarily due to the reclassification of Evergy Metro's $300.0 million of 3.15% Senior Notes and $79.5 million of 2.95% Environmental Improvement Revenue Refunding (EIRR) bonds and Evergy Kansas Central's $50.0 million of 6.15% of FMBs from long-term to current, partially offset by the repayments of Evergy's $287.5 million of 5.292% of Senior Notes and Evergy Missouri West's $100.0 million of 3.74% Senior Notes. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's collateralized note payable increased $40.0 million primarily driven by Evergy's increase in retail electric accounts receivable balances in December 2022, resulting in a higher level of retail electric receivables available for sale through Evergy's receivable sales facilities. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's regulatory liabilities - current increased $84.7 million primarily due to $48.4 million ordered to be refunded to TFR customers in the next 12 months for over-collections related to the calculation of Evergy Kansas Central's capital structure for the rate years 2020 - 2022 and the amortization of excess deferred income taxes, and a $26.4 million increase in the current portion of Evergy Missouri West's Sibley AAO regulatory liability. See \"Evergy Kansas Central TFR Formal Challenge\" in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's asset retirement obligations - current increased $20.9 million primarily due to changes in estimates and the expected timing of remediation at several Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro ponds and landfills containing CCRs. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's pension and post-retirement liability decreased $420.7 million primarily due to a decrease in benefit obligations driven by $160.4 million and $145.9 million decreases due to actuarial \n\nremeasurements at Evergy Metro and Evergy Kansas Central, respectively, and pension contributions of $46.9 million and $21.0 million at Evergy Metro and Evergy Kansas Central, respectively. \n\n&#8226; Evergy's asset retirement obligations - long-term increased $172.2 million primarily due to changes in the estimates of several Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro ponds and landfills containing CCRs. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES &#160; \n\nEvergy relies primarily upon cash from operations, short-term borrowings, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its capital requirements. Evergy's capital requirements primarily consist of capital expenditures, payment of contractual obligations and other commitments and the payment of dividends to shareholders. \n\nCapital Sources \n\nCash Flows from Operations \n\nEvergy's cash flows from operations are driven by the regulated sale of electricity. These cash flows are relatively stable but the timing and level of these cash flows can vary based on weather and economic conditions, future regulatory proceedings, the timing of cash payments made for costs recoverable under regulatory mechanisms and the time such costs are recovered, and unanticipated expenses such as unplanned plant outages and storms. Evergy's cash flows from operations were $1,801.9 million, $1,351.7 million and $1,753.8 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nShort-Term Borrowings \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Evergy had $1.2 billion of available borrowing capacity under its master credit facility. The available borrowing capacity under the master credit facility consisted of $449.3 million for Evergy, Inc., $227.9 million for Evergy Kansas Central, $239.0 million for Evergy Metro and $250.8 million for Evergy Missouri West. The Evergy Companies' borrowing capacity under the master credit facility also supports their issuance of commercial paper. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the master credit facility. \n\nIn February 2022, Evergy, Inc. entered into a $500.0 million unsecured Term Loan Facility that originally expired in February 2023. In February 2023, Evergy, Inc. amended the $500.0 million Term Loan Facility to expire in February 2024. As a result of the amendment, Evergy, Inc. demonstrated its intent and ability to refinance the Term Loan Facility and reflected this $500 million borrowing within long-term debt, net, on Evergy's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. Evergy's borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. \n\nAlong with cash flows from operations and receivable sales facilities, Evergy generally uses borrowings under its master credit facility and the issuance of commercial paper to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements. Evergy believes that its existing cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its master credit facility provide sufficient liquidity for its existing capital requirements. \n\nLong-Term Debt and Equity Issuances \n\nFrom time to time, Evergy issues long-term debt and equity to repay short-term debt, refinance maturing long-term debt and finance growth. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Evergy's capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 Common equity 48% 49% Long-term debt, including VIEs 52% 51% ##TABLE_END\n\nUnder stipulations with the MPSC and KCC, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro are required to maintain common equity at not less than 35%, 40% and 40%, respectively, of total capitalization. The master credit facility and certain debt instruments of the Evergy Companies also contain restrictions that require the maintenance of certain capitalization and leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2022, the Evergy Companies were in compliance with these covenants. \n\nSignificant Debt Issuances \n\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding significant debt issuances. \n\nEquity Issuance \n\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding Evergy's securities purchase agreement with Bluescape to purchase Evergy's common stock in 2021. \n\nCredit Ratings \n\nThe ratings of the Evergy Companies' debt securities by the credit rating agencies impact the Evergy Companies' liquidity, including the cost of borrowings under their master credit facility and in the capital markets. The Evergy Companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as vital to their access to and cost of debt financing and, to that end, maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations, financial position and future prospects. While a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of the Evergy Companies' debt, it could increase interest charges under the master credit facility. A decrease in credit ratings could also have, among other things, an adverse impact, which could be material, on the Evergy Companies' access to capital, the cost of funds, the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings, the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and Evergy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries. \n\nAs of February 23, 2023, the major credit rating agencies rated the Evergy Companies' securities as detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Moody's S&#38;P Global Investors Service (a) \n\nRatings (a) \n\nEvergy Outlook Stable Negative Corporate Credit Rating -- A- Senior Unsecured Debt Baa2 BBB+ Commercial Paper P-2 A-2 Evergy Kansas Central Outlook Stable Negative Corporate Credit Rating Baa1 A- Senior Secured Debt A2 A Commercial Paper P-2 A-2 Evergy Kansas South Outlook Stable Negative Corporate Credit Rating Baa1 A- Senior Secured Debt A2 A Short-Term Rating P-2 A-2 Evergy Metro Outlook Stable Negative Corporate Credit Rating Baa1 A Senior Secured Debt A2 A+ Senior Unsecured Debt -- A Commercial Paper P-2 A-1 Evergy Missouri West Outlook Stable Negative Corporate Credit Rating Baa2 A- Senior Secured Debt A3 A Commercial Paper P-2 A-2 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. \n\nShelf Registration Statements and Regulatory Authorizations \n\nEvergy \n\nIn September 2021, Evergy filed an automatic shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of securities with the SEC, which expires in September 2024. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central \n\nIn September 2021, Evergy Kansas Central filed an automatic shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of unsecured debt securities and FMBs with the SEC, which expires in September 2024. \n\nEvergy Metro \n\nIn September 2021, Evergy Metro filed an automatic shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of unsecured notes and mortgage bonds with the SEC, which expires in September 2024. \n\nThe following table summarizes the regulatory short-term and long-term debt financing authorizations for Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West and the remaining amount available under these authorizations as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Type of Authorization Commission Expiration Date Authorization Amount Available Under Authorization Evergy Kansas Central &#38; Evergy Kansas South (in millions) Short-Term Debt FERC December 2024 $ 1,250.0 $ 477.9 Evergy Metro Short-Term Debt FERC December 2024 $ 1,250.0 $ 1,139.0 Evergy Missouri West Short-Term Debt FERC December 2024 $ 750.0 $ 240.3 Long-Term Debt FERC October 2024 $ 600.0 $ 300.0 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to the above regulatory authorizations, the Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of FMBs or mortgage bonds, as applicable, that can be issued by each entity. Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West must comply with these restrictions prior to the issuance of additional FMBs, mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness. \n\nUnder the Evergy Kansas Central mortgage, the issuance of FMBs is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, so long as any bonds issued prior to January 1, 1997, remain outstanding, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Evergy Kansas Central&#8217;s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property retirement (which, as defined, does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries), for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance, are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2022, $416.4 million principal amount of additional FMBs could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings. \n\nUnder the Evergy Kansas South mortgage, the amount of FMBs authorized is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion and the issuance of FMBs is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Evergy Kansas South's net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one-half times the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all Evergy Kansas South FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $2,828.6 million principal amount of additional Evergy Kansas South FMBs could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings. \n\nUnder the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of December 1, 1986, as supplemented (Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture), additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds may be issued on the basis of 75% of property additions or retired bonds. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $5,254.1 million principal amount of additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage. \n\nUnder the First Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of March 1, 2022 (Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture), additional Evergy Missouri West mortgage bonds may be issued on the basis of 75% of property additions or retired bonds. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $1,905.0 million principal \n\namount of additional Evergy Missouri West mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Evergy had approximately $25.2 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\nCapital Requirements \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nEvergy expects to need cash for its long-term strategy of transitioning its generation fleet to be more sustainable by reducing CO 2 emissions as well as executing other utility construction programs required to maintain Evergy's electric utility operations, improve reliability and expand facilities related to providing electric service. These capital expenditures could include, but are not limited to, expenditures to develop new transmission lines and make improvements to power plants, transmission and distribution lines and equipment. See \"Executive Summary - Strategy\", above for further information regarding Evergy's strategy. Evergy's capital expenditures were $2,166.5 million, $1,972.5 million and $1,560.3 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nCapital expenditures projected for the next five years, excluding AFUDC and including costs of removal, are detailed in the following table. This capital expenditure plan is subject to management's discretion and continual review and could change. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for information regarding potential risks to Evergy's capital expenditure plan. \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 (millions) Generating facilities - new renewable/other generation $ 375.0 $ 89.0 $ 670.0 $ 603.0 $ 400.0 Generating facilities - other 414.0 354.0 335.0 290.0 364.0 Transmission facilities 662.0 694.0 598.0 629.0 678.0 Distribution facilities 697.0 622.0 669.0 642.0 715.0 General facilities 258.0 247.0 189.0 195.0 218.0 Total capital expenditures $ 2,406.0 $ 2,006.0 $ 2,461.0 $ 2,359.0 $ 2,375.0 ##TABLE_END\n\nSignificant Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments \n\nIn the course of its business activities, the Evergy Companies enter into a variety of contracts and commercial commitments. Some of these result in direct obligations reflected on Evergy's consolidated balance sheets while others are commitments, some firm and some based on uncertainties, not reflected in Evergy's underlying consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe information in the following table is provided to summarize Evergy's significant cash obligations and commercial commitments. \n\n##TABLE_START Payment due by period 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027 Total Long-term debt (millions) Principal $ 439.5 $ 1,300.0 $ 636.0 $ 350.0 $ 621.9 $ 6,984.9 $ 10,332.3 Interest 356.8 345.1 325.3 304.7 292.0 3,572.3 5,196.2 Pension and other post-retirement plans (a) \n\n32.0 32.0 32.0 32.0 32.0 (a) 160.0 Purchase commitments Fuel 308.6 157.5 130.4 132.9 57.1 148.3 934.8 Power 62.7 57.1 57.5 57.5 57.5 275.2 567.5 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Evergy expects to make contributions to the pension and other post-retirement plans beyond 2027 but the amounts are not yet determined. \n\nLong-term debt includes current maturities. Long-term debt principal excludes $79.6 million of unamortized net discounts and debt issuance costs and a $92.1 million fair value adjustment recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger that was completed in 2018. Variable rate interest obligations are based on rates as of December 31, 2022. \n\nEvergy expects to contribute $32.0 million to the pension and other post-retirement plans in 2023, of which the majority is expected to be paid by Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro. Additional contributions to the plans are expected beyond 2027 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined. Amounts for years after 2023 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2023. Actual amounts for years after 2023 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above. \n\nFuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation costs. Power commitments consist of certain commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements, capacity purchases and firm transmission service. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Evergy has other insignificant commitments as well as other insignificant long-term liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet, which are not included in the table above. \n\nCommon Stock Dividends \n\nThe amount and timing of dividends payable on Evergy's common stock are within the sole discretion of the Evergy Board. The amount and timing of dividends declared by the Evergy Board will be dependent on considerations such as Evergy's earnings, financial position, cash flows, capitalization ratios, regulation, reinvestment opportunities and debt covenants. Evergy targets a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the common stock dividend declared by the Evergy Board in February 2023. \n\nThe Evergy Companies also have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restrictions on dividend payments. \n\nCash Flows \n\nThe following table presents Evergy's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 (millions) Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,801.9 $ 1,351.7 Cash flows used in investing activities (2,152.2) (1,913.8) Cash flows from financing activities 349.3 443.4 ##TABLE_END\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nEvergy's cash flows from operating activities increased $450.2 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily driven by: \n\n&#8226; a $382.7 million increase in cash receipts for retail electric sales in 2022 primarily driven by favorable weather and an increase in weather-normalized demand; and \n\n&#8226; $365.5 million of cash payments for net fuel and purchased power costs during the February 2021 winter weather event; partially offset by \n\n&#8226; a $104.8 million decrease in cash payments in 2022 primarily due to the timing of payments made to taxing authorities for property tax payments as well as various suppliers and service providers for goods and services purchased in the ordinary course of business; and \n\n&#8226; $89.9 million of cash receipts related to non-regulated energy marketing margins earned during the February 2021 winter weather event. \n\nCash Flows used in Investing Activities \n\nEvergy's cash flows used in investing activities increased $238.4 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily driven by a $194.0 million increase in additions to property, plant and equipment due to increases at Evergy Kansas \n\nCentral, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West of $83.2 million, $98.0 million and $17.0 million, respectively, primarily due to increased spending for a variety of capital projects including transmission and distribution projects related to grid resiliency and other infrastructure improvements. \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n\nEvergy's cash flows from financing activities decreased $94.1 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily driven by: \n\n&#8226; a $167.6 million decrease in short-term debt borrowings primarily driven by: \n\n&#9702; a $275.5 million decrease at Evergy Missouri West due primarily to $296.4 million of fuel and purchased power costs related to the February 2021 winter weather event; partially offset by \n\n&#9702; a $111.0 million increase at Evergy Metro primarily due to increased borrowings in 2022 driven by higher cash capital expenditures; and \n\n&#8226; $112.5 million of Evergy common stock issued in April 2021 pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with an affiliate of Bluescape Energy Partners, LLC (Bluescape); partially offset by \n\n&#8226; an $81.0 increase in collateralized short-term debt, net primarily due to Evergy's increase in retail electric accounts receivable balances in 2022, resulting in a higher level of retail electric receivables available for sale through Evergy's receivable sales facilities; \n\n&#8226; a $70.4 million increase in proceeds from long-term debt, net primarily due to Evergy Missouri West's issuance of $300.0 million of 5.15% FMBs in December 2022 and Evergy Missouri West's issuance of $250.0 million of 3.75% FMBs in March 2022; partially offset by Evergy Missouri West's issuance of $500.0 million of Series A, B and C Senior Notes in April 2021; and \n\n&#8226; a $34.3 million decrease in the repayment of borrowings against cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance primarily due to a higher number of policy settlements in 2021. \n\nEVERGY KANSAS CENTRAL, INC. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe below results of operations and related discussion for Evergy Kansas Central is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) to Form 10-K. \n\nThe following table summarizes Evergy Kansas Central's comparative results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Change 2021 &#160;

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK &#160; \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Evergy faces risks that are either non-financial or non-quantifiable. Such risks principally include business, legal, operational and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7, MD&#38;A for further discussion of risk factors. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply, interest rates and security prices. Commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energy-related products, including natural gas and coal. Credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non-performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates. In addition, Evergy's investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and non-qualified retirement benefits give rise to security price risk. \n\nManagement has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on Evergy's operating results. During the ordinary course of business, the Evergy Companies' hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation. Though management believes its risk management practices are effective, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk. Evergy could experience losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position, due to many factors, including unexpectedly large or \n\nrapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets, regulatory-driven market rule changes and/or bankruptcy or non-performance of customers or counterparties, and/or failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize. \n\nHedging Strategies \n\nFrom time to time, Evergy utilizes derivative instruments to execute risk management and hedging strategies. Derivative instruments, such as futures, forward contracts, swaps or options, derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors. These derivative instruments include negotiated contracts, which are referred to as over-the-counter derivatives, and instruments listed and traded on an exchange. \n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nThe Evergy Companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to non-regulated energy marketing activities. These activities expose the Evergy Companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energy-related products. Exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume, as well as the wholesale market prices received by the Evergy Companies' generation resources and the wholesale market prices paid to procure power to serve customer load or satisfy regulatory or contractual obligations. Customers' electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors. Quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability, price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and unplanned outages at facilities that use fossil fuels. Evergy's exposure to fluctuations in these factors is limited by the cost-based regulation of its regulated operations in Kansas and Missouri as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through fuel recovery mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results. The majority of derivative instruments used to manage Evergy's commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. Mark-to-market changes for these instruments entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Evergy's consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments entered into for non-regulated energy marketing activities are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. \n\nValue at Risk (VaR) Associated with Energy Marketing Activities \n\nManagement uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR to measure Evergy's commodity price risk associated with its trading portfolio related to non-regulated energy marketing activities. The VaR is calculated using historical 30 day exponentially weighted volatilities and correlations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period. Based on this VaR analysis, as of December 31, 2022, a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nThe following table shows the end, high, average and low market risk associated with its trading portfolio related to non-regulated energy marketing activities as measured by VaR for the periods indicated. \n\n##TABLE_START VaR Model Trading Portfolio Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 End High Average Low End High Average Low (millions) (millions) $ 0.3 $ 1.9 $ 0.6 $ &#8212; $ 0.3 $ 1.3 $ 0.4 $ 0.1 ##TABLE_END\n\nManagement back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements. Based on the assumed 95% confidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every 20 trading days. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nEvergy manages interest rate risk and short- and long-term liquidity by limiting its exposure to variable interest rate debt and debt-like financial instruments to a percentage of total debt, diversifying maturity dates and, from time to time, entering into interest rate hedging transactions. At December 31, 2022, 17.1% of Evergy's total debt (including short-term borrowings consisting of short-term debt in excess of utility construction work in progress balances that is not eligible for capitalization as AFUDC and borrowings under Evergy's receivable sale facilities) were exposed to interest rate risk. Evergy computes and presents information regarding the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt, short-term borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a 100-basis-point change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Evergy had $1,903.1 million of short-term borrowings, variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt exposed to variable interest rate sensitivity. A 100-basis-point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact Evergy's income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately $17.1 million, net of AFUDC borrowed funds which represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity and is a reduction of interest expense. \n\nCredit Risk \n\nEvergy is exposed to counterparty credit risk largely in the form of accounts receivable from its retail and wholesale electric customers and through executory contracts with market risk exposure. The credit risk associated with accounts receivable from retail and wholesale customers is largely mitigated by Evergy's large number of individual customers spread across diverse customer classes and the ability to recover bad debt expense in customer rates. The Evergy Companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk control mechanisms, such as letters of credit, when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure. Credit risk of the Evergy Companies' derivative instruments relates to the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non-performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on potential loss on counterparty exposure for derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022. \n\nInvestment Risk \n\nEvergy maintains trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund its 94% share of decommissioning the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant and also maintains trusts to fund pension benefits as well as certain non-qualified retirement benefits. As of December 31, 2022, these funds were primarily invested in a diversified mix of equity and debt securities and reflected at fair value on Evergy's balance sheet. The equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates and other market factors. \n\nAs nuclear decommissioning costs are currently recovered in customer rates, Evergy defers both realized and unrealized gains and losses for these securities as an offset to its regulatory liability for decommissioning Wolf Creek and as such, fluctuations in the value of these securities do not impact earnings. A significant decline in the value of pension or non-qualified retirement assets could require Evergy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. In addition, a decline in the fair value of these plan assets, in the absence of additional cash contributions to the plans by Evergy, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods by Evergy. \n\nIn addition to Evergy's investments in debt and equity securities in its nuclear decommissioning and pension trusts, Evergy also makes limited equity investments in early-stage energy solution companies. These limited equity investments are often in privately-owned companies that do not have reasonably determinable fair values. However, from time to time, these investments could have changes in fair value as a result of acquisitions, mergers, initial public offerings, or observable market transactions for similar investments. Evergy typically seeks to liquidate its position in these companies as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an exit event such as an acquisition or initial public offering (including after the expiration of any related lock-up provisions), which serves to largely mitigate any ongoing market risk related to the investments. \n\n"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRate Matters and Regulation - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Kansas Corporation Commission and by the Missouri Public Service Commission (collectively the \"Commissions\"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric distribution companies in Kansas and Missouri, respectively. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial \n\nstatements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures. \n\nThe Company's rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. \n\nWhen the Company retires a regulated plant, the Company must assess the probability of recovery of the regulated plant, which is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. Pending receipt of regulatory approval for the retirement and/or recovery of the affected plants, accounting for early retirements of regulated plants involves judgment related to the nature of the early retirement and the likelihood that the Company will recover its remaining investment in these retired generating plants with a return. Auditing the judgments related to the nature and likelihood of the retirement and the probability of recovering the generating plant investment with a return involves especially subjective and complex judgment. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) probability of potential charges related to the abandonment of regulated plants, and (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates, including Company management's determination of the likelihood of recovery of the full investment of certain regulated plants and probability of refunding amounts previously collected from customers related to certain regulated plants. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. Such external information included relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in Kansas and Missouri, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available \n\ninformation to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. \n\n&#8226; For regulatory matters in process, including those that could impact the early retirement of regulated plants, we inspected the Company's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company's future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the reasonableness of management's judgments for potential indicators of abandonment by performing the following: \n\n&#9702; We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. \n\n&#9702; We inspected the capital projects budget and construction-in-process listings and inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. \n\n&#9702; We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment. \n\n&#8226; We compared actual spend for projects that have been capitalized to property, plant, and equipment to budget. We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. For significant projects that were over budget or if full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management's assessment of the probability of a disallowance. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated management's analysis, and letters from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated management's conclusions for the probable recovery of the retired regulated plant investment with a return. We evaluated management's conclusions regarding the accounting for the abandonment of certain regulated plants and the impact of recent rate orders on the accounting. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nKansas City, Missouri &#160; \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Evergy Kansas Central, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergy Kansas Central, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRate Matters and Regulation - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Kansas Corporation Commission (the \"Commission\"), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric distribution companies in Kansas. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures. \n\nThe Company's rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commission's regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commission will not approve (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or (2) recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. \n\nWhen the Company retires a regulated plant, the Company must assess the probability of recovery of the regulated plant, which is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. Pending receipt of regulatory approval for the retirement and/or recovery of the affected plants, accounting for early retirements of regulated plants involves judgment related to the nature of the early retirement and the likelihood that the Company will recover its remaining investment in these retired generating plants with a return. Auditing the judgments related to the nature and likelihood of the retirement and the probability of recovering the generating plant investment with a return involves especially subjective and complex judgment. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) probability of potential charges related to the abandonment of regulated plants, and (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commission, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commission included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. Such external information included relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission for the Company and other public utilities in Kansas, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commission's treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. \n\n&#8226; For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company&#8217;s filings with the Commission and the filings with the Commission by intervenors that may impact the Company&#8217;s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management&#8217;s assertions. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the reasonableness of management's judgments for potential indicators of abandonment by performing the following: \n\n&#9702; We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. \n\n&#9702; We inspected the capital projects budget and construction-in-process listings and inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. \n\n&#9702; We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commission to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment. \n\n&#8226; We compared actual spend for projects that have been capitalized to property, plant, and equipment to budget. We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. For significant projects that were over budget or if full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management's assessment of the probability of a disallowance. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated management's analysis, and letters from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nKansas City, Missouri \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Evergy Metro, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergy Metro, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

The terms \"Evergy,\" \"Evergy Kansas Central,\" \"Evergy Metro\" and \"Evergy Companies\" are used throughout this report. \"Evergy\" refers to Evergy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. \"Evergy Kansas Central\" refers to Evergy Kansas Central, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. \"Evergy Metro\" refers to Evergy Metro, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. \"Evergy Companies\" refers to Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro, collectively, which are individual registrants within the Evergy consolidated group. \n\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nOrganization \n\nEvergy is a public utility holding company incorporated in 2017 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Kansas Central, Inc. (Evergy Kansas Central) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas. Evergy Kansas Central has one active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South, Inc. (Evergy Kansas South). \n\n&#8226; Evergy Metro, Inc. (Evergy Metro) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Missouri West, Inc. (Evergy Missouri West) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri. \n\n&#8226; Evergy Transmission Company, LLC (Evergy Transmission Company) owns 13.5 % of Transource Energy, LLC (Transource) with the remaining 86.5 % owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP). Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects. Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central also owns a 50 % interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind), which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. Prairie Wind owns a 108 -mile, 345 kV double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP). Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy. Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately 15,400 MWs of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 1.7 million customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nEach of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated financial statements includes the accounts of their subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which they are the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in jointly-owned generation facilities are included on a proportionate basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment). \n\nEvergy Metro elected not to apply \"push-down accounting\" related to the Great Plains Energy Incorporated (Great Plains Energy) and Evergy Kansas Central merger in 2018, whereby the adjustments of assets and liabilities to fair value and the resulting goodwill would be recorded on the financial statements of the acquired subsidiary. These adjustments for Evergy Metro, as well as those related to the acquired assets and liabilities of Great Plains Energy and its other direct subsidiaries, are only reflected on Evergy's consolidated financial statements. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition. \n\nFuel Inventory and Supplies \n\nThe Evergy Companies record fuel inventory and supplies at average cost. The following table separately states the balances for fuel inventory and supplies. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 Evergy (millions) Fuel inventory $ 180.7 &#160; $ 160.9 &#160; Supplies 492.2 &#160; 405.8 &#160; Fuel inventory and supplies $ 672.9 &#160; $ 566.7 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central Fuel inventory $ 97.2 &#160; $ 74.3 &#160; Supplies 252.3 &#160; 208.9 &#160; Fuel inventory and supplies $ 349.5 &#160; $ 283.2 &#160; Evergy Metro Fuel inventory $ 59.0 &#160; $ 62.0 &#160; Supplies 181.6 &#160; 149.0 &#160; Fuel inventory and supplies $ 240.6 &#160; $ 211.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nThe Evergy Companies record the value of property, plant and equipment, including that of VIEs, at cost. For plant, cost includes contracted services, direct labor and materials, indirect charges for engineering and supervision and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). AFUDC represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity. AFUDC equity funds are included as a non-cash item in other income and AFUDC borrowed funds are a reduction of interest expense. AFUDC is computed by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress. The rates used to compute gross AFUDC are compounded semi-annually. \n\nThe amounts of the Evergy Companies' AFUDC for borrowed and equity funds are detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Evergy (millions) AFUDC borrowed funds $ 15.8 &#160; $ 14.7 &#160; $ 16.5 &#160; AFUDC equity funds 22.5 &#160; 29.4 &#160; 17.2 &#160; Total $ 38.3 &#160; $ 44.1 &#160; $ 33.7 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central AFUDC borrowed funds $ 6.9 &#160; $ 7.1 &#160; $ 8.5 &#160; AFUDC equity funds 8.5 &#160; 14.9 &#160; 9.1 &#160; Total $ 15.4 &#160; $ 22.0 &#160; $ 17.6 &#160; Evergy Metro AFUDC borrowed funds $ 6.5 &#160; $ 6.0 &#160; $ 6.0 &#160; AFUDC equity funds 14.2 &#160; 12.6 &#160; 8.0 &#160; Total $ 20.7 &#160; $ 18.6 &#160; $ 14.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe average rates used in the calculation of AFUDC are detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Evergy Kansas Central 3.1 % 4.9 % 4.7 % Evergy Metro 5.7 % 5.6 % 5.2 % Evergy Missouri West 2.3 % 2.6 % 3.5 % ##TABLE_END\n\nWhen property units are retired or otherwise disposed, the original cost, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Repair of property and replacement of items not considered to be units of property are expensed as incurred, except for planned refueling and maintenance outages at Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek). As authorized by regulators, the incremental maintenance cost incurred for such outages is deferred and amortized to expense ratably over the period between planned outages. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization \n\nDepreciation and amortization of utility plant other than nuclear fuel is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of depreciable property based on rates approved by state regulatory authorities. Annual depreciation rates average approximately 3 %. See Note 7 for more details. Nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense based on the quantity of heat produced during the generation of electricity. \n\nThe depreciable lives of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's property, plant and equipment are detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Evergy Evergy Kansas Central Evergy Metro (years) Generating facilities 8 to 87 8 to 87 20 to 60 Transmission facilities 15 to 94 36 to 94 15 to 70 Distribution facilities 8 to 73 19 to 73 8 to 55 Other 5 to 84 7 to 84 5 to 50 ##TABLE_END\n\nAbandoned Plant \n\nWhen the Evergy Companies retire utility plant, the original cost, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable an asset will be retired significantly in advance of its original expected useful life and in the near term, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset and a probable abandonment. If the asset is still in service, the net amount is classified as plant to \n\nbe retired, net on the consolidated balance sheets. If the asset is no longer in service, the net amount is classified as a regulatory asset on the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nThe Evergy Companies must also assess the probability of full recovery of the remaining net book value of the abandonment. The net book value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandonment is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. An impairment charge, if any, would equal the difference between the remaining net book value of the asset and the present value of the future revenues expected from the asset. \n\nEvergy Missouri West retired its Sibley Station in 2018 and the retirement of Sibley Unit 3 met the criteria to be considered an abandonment. Evergy has classified the remaining net book value of Sibley Unit 3 as retired generation facilities within regulatory assets on its consolidated balance sheet. In October 2019, the MPSC issued an accounting authority order (AAO) requiring Evergy Missouri West to defer to a regulatory liability all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, taxes including accumulated deferred income taxes and all other costs associated with Sibley Station following its retirement in November 2018 to be considered in Evergy Missouri West's 2022 rate case. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the AAO and Evergy Missouri West's 2022 rate case. \n\nNuclear Plant Decommissioning Costs \n\nNuclear plant decommissioning cost estimates are based on either the immediate dismantlement method or the deferred dismantling method as determined by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) and MPSC and include the costs of decontamination, dismantlement and site restoration. Based on these cost estimates, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro each contribute to a tax-qualified trust fund to be used to decommission Wolf Creek. Related liabilities for decommissioning are included on Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated balance sheets in asset retirement obligations (AROs). \n\nAs a result of the authorized regulatory treatment and related regulatory accounting, differences between the fair value of the assets held in the nuclear decommissioning trust and the amounts recorded for the accumulated accretion and depreciation expense associated with the decommissioning ARO are recorded as a regulatory liability on Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6 for discussion of AROs including those associated with nuclear plant decommissioning costs. \n\nRegulatory Accounting \n\nAccounting standards are applied that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation. Accordingly, regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent. See Note 4 for additional information concerning regulatory matters. \n\nCash Surrender Value of Life Insurance \n\nAmounts related to corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in other long-term assets and are detailed in the following table for Evergy. Substantially all of Evergy's COLI-related balances relate to Evergy Kansas Central's COLI activity. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 Evergy (millions) Cash surrender value of policies $ 1,387.4 &#160; $ 1,363.0 &#160; Borrowings against policies ( 1,256.6 ) ( 1,232.3 ) Corporate-owned life insurance, net $ 130.8 &#160; $ 130.7 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nIncreases in cash surrender value and death benefits are recorded in other income in the Evergy Companies' consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Interest expense incurred on policy loans is offset against the policy income. Income from death benefits is highly variable from period to period. \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the following financial instruments for which it was practicable to estimate that value. \n\nNuclear decommissioning trust fund - The Evergy Companies' nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the fund and/or valuation models. \n\nDerivative instruments - The Evergy Companies' derivative instruments are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivative instruments, quoted prices for similar contracts and/or valuation models. \n\nPension plans - For financial reporting purposes, the market value of plan assets is the fair value based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the fund and/or valuation models. \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nThe Evergy Companies record derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with GAAP. The Evergy Companies enter into derivative contracts to manage risk exposure to commodity price and interest rate fluctuations and also for trading purposes. See Note 13 for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments and hedging activities. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have the right to invoice. Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by the Evergy Companies. Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month. This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs. The Evergy Companies' estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates. The Evergy Companies' unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes. See Note 3 for the balance of unbilled receivables for each of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nThe Evergy Companies also collect sales taxes and franchise fees from customers concurrent with revenue-producing activities that are levied by state and local governments. These items are excluded from revenue, and thus are not reflected on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro. \n\nSee Note 2 for additional details regarding revenue recognition from sales of electricity by the Evergy Companies. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nHistorical loss information generally provides the basis for the Evergy Companies' assessment of expected credit losses. The Evergy Companies use an aging of accounts receivable method to assess historical loss information. When historical experience may not fully reflect the Evergy Companies' expectations about the future, the Evergy Companies will adjust historical loss information, as necessary, to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical loss information. \n\nReceivables are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible, which is based on a number of factors including specific facts surrounding an account and management's judgment. \n\nAsset Impairments \n\nLong-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset to be held and used is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. \n\nGoodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The annual test must be performed at the same time each year. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. See Note 5 for additional details on goodwill. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n\nThe Evergy Companies recognize tax benefits based on a \"more-likely-than-not\" recognition threshold. In addition, the Evergy Companies recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. \n\nEvergy files a consolidated federal income tax return as well as unitary and combined income tax returns in several state jurisdictions with Kansas and Missouri being the most significant. Income taxes for consolidated or combined subsidiaries are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of income or loss. Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's income tax provisions include taxes allocated based on their separate company's income or loss. \n\nThe Evergy Companies have established a net regulatory liability for future refunds to be made to customers for amounts collected from customers in excess of income taxes in current rates. Tax credits are recognized in the year generated except for certain Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West investment tax credits that have been deferred and amortized over the remaining service lives of the related properties. \n\nOther Income (Expense), Net \n\nIn 2022 and 2021, Evergy's investment earnings included a realized loss of $ 16.3 million and unrealized gain of $ 27.7 million, respectively, related to Evergy's equity investment in an early-stage energy solutions company. See \"Evergy Equity Investment\" within this Note 1 for further information. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' other income includes income from AFUDC equity funds. See \"Property, Plant and Equipment\" within this Note 1 for these amounts for 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nThe table below shows the detail of other expense for each of the Evergy Companies. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Evergy (millions) Non-service cost component of net benefit cost $ ( 62.9 ) $ ( 55.6 ) $ ( 58.6 ) Other ( 34.4 ) ( 31.8 ) ( 19.6 ) Other expense $ ( 97.3 ) $ ( 87.4 ) $ ( 78.2 ) Evergy Kansas Central Non-service cost component of net benefit cost $ ( 17.1 ) $ ( 15.6 ) $ ( 21.2 ) Other ( 22.5 ) ( 20.3 ) ( 17.7 ) Other expense $ ( 39.6 ) $ ( 35.9 ) $ ( 38.9 ) Evergy Metro Non-service cost component of net benefit cost $ ( 31.0 ) $ ( 26.7 ) $ ( 24.2 ) Other ( 2.9 ) ( 2.7 ) ( 1.3 ) Other expense $ ( 33.9 ) $ ( 29.4 ) $ ( 25.5 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nEarnings Per Share \n\nTo compute basic earnings per share (EPS), Evergy divides net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS includes the effect of issuable common shares resulting from restricted share units (RSUs), restricted stock and a warrant. Evergy computes the dilutive effects of potential issuances of common shares using the treasury stock method or the contingently issuable share method, as applicable. \n\nThe following table reconciles Evergy's basic and diluted EPS. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Income (millions, except per share amounts) Net income $ 765.0 &#160; $ 891.9 &#160; $ 630.0 &#160; Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n12.3 &#160; 12.2 &#160; 11.7 &#160; Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. $ 752.7 &#160; $ 879.7 &#160; $ 618.3 &#160; Common Shares Outstanding &#160; &#160; Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic 229.9 &#160; 229.0 &#160; 227.2 &#160; Add: effect of dilutive securities 0.4 &#160; 0.6 &#160; 0.3 &#160; Diluted average number of common shares outstanding 230.3 &#160; 229.6 &#160; 227.5 &#160; Basic EPS $ 3.27 &#160; $ 3.84 &#160; $ 2.72 &#160; Diluted EPS $ 3.27 &#160; $ 3.83 &#160; $ 2.72 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAnti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2022 were 3,950,000 common shares issuable pursuant to a warrant. There were no anti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2021. Anti-dilutive shares excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2020 were 127,884 RSUs. \n\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Evergy (millions) Cash paid for (received from): Interest, net of amount capitalized $ 393.7 &#160; $ 356.9 &#160; $ 367.6 &#160; Interest of VIEs &#8212; &#160; 0.2 &#160; 0.8 &#160; Income taxes, net of refunds 21.6 &#160; ( 19.6 ) ( 46.5 ) Non-cash investing transactions: Property, plant and equipment additions 354.7 &#160; 269.3 &#160; 463.3 &#160; Non-cash financing transactions: Issuance of stock for compensation and reinvested dividends &#8212; &#160; 0.7 &#160; 0.9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Evergy Kansas Central (millions) Cash paid for (received from): Interest, net of amount capitalized $ 170.2 &#160; $ 149.3 &#160; $ 157.5 &#160; Interest of VIEs &#8212; &#160; 0.2 &#160; 0.8 &#160; Income taxes, net of refunds 79.8 &#160; 37.5 &#160; 4.7 &#160; Non-cash investing transactions: Property, plant and equipment additions 203.9 &#160; 101.9 &#160; 235.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Evergy Metro (millions) Cash paid for (received from): Interest, net of amount capitalized $ 114.6 &#160; $ 110.8 &#160; $ 109.9 &#160; Income taxes, net of refunds ( 15.2 ) 36.6 &#160; 4.8 &#160; Non-cash investing transactions: Property, plant and equipment additions 125.8 &#160; 102.2 &#160; 192.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNon-cash property, plant and equipment additions in 2022 and 2020 for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro include a non-cash addition related to the revision in estimate of various ARO liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the Wolf Creek ARO liability in the third quarter of 2020. See Note 6 for more details. \n\nDividends Declared \n\nIn February 2023, Evergy's Board of Directors (Evergy Board) declared a quarterly dividend of $ 0.6125 per share on Evergy's common stock. The common dividend is payable March 22, 2023, to shareholders of record as of March 9, 2023. \n\nFebruary 2021 Winter Weather Event \n\nIn February 2021, much of the central and southern United States, including the service territories of the Evergy Companies, experienced a significant winter weather event that resulted in extremely cold temperatures over a multi-day period (February 2021 winter weather event). These circumstances resulted in higher than normal market prices within the SPP Integrated Marketplace for both natural gas and power for the duration of the February 2021 winter weather event. As part of the February 2021 winter weather event and inclusive of the aforementioned items, Evergy incurred natural gas and purchased power costs, net of wholesale revenues, of $ 367.9 million. This $ 367.9 million of net fuel and purchased power costs incurred was primarily driven by $ 296.6 million of costs at Evergy Missouri West and $ 134.3 million of costs at Evergy Kansas Central, partially offset by $ 63.0 million of net wholesale revenues at Evergy Metro. \n\nThe Evergy Companies deferred substantially all of the fuel and purchased power costs, net of wholesale revenues, related to the February 2021 winter weather event to a regulatory asset or liability for recovery or refund through the respective fuel recovery mechanisms of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro and through a securitization financing order at Evergy Missouri West. See Note 4 for additional information regarding these regulatory proceedings. \n\nThe Evergy Companies also engage in non-regulated energy marketing activities in various regional power markets. The energy marketing margins related to these non-regulatory energy marketing activities are recorded net in operating revenues on the Evergy Companies' statements of income and comprehensive income. As a result of the elevated market prices experienced in regional power markets across the central and southern United States driven by the February 2021 winter weather event discussed above, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central recorded $ 94.5 million of energy marketing margins in 2021, related to the February 2021 winter weather event, primarily driven by activities in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). \n\nEvergy Equity Investment \n\nFrom time to time, Evergy makes limited equity investments in early-stage energy solution companies. These investments have historically not had a significant impact on Evergy's results of operations. In October 2021, an equity investment in which Evergy held a minority stake through an initial investment of $ 3.7 million was acquired through a transaction involving a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). As a result of its equity investment in the company that was acquired in the SPAC transaction, Evergy received shares of the resulting public company upon the closing of the transaction, which were subject to a restriction on sale for 150 days. Evergy recorded a $ 27.7 million unrealized gain in the fourth quarter of 2021 for the conversion of its shares into the newly formed public company and based on the closing share price as of December 31, 2021 adjusted to reflect the restriction on the sale of shares. The equity investment had a fair value of $ 31.4 million as of December 31, 2021. \n\nIn March 2022, Evergy sold its shares in the equity investment to a financial institution through a share forward agreement following the expiration of the restriction on sale. As part of the share forward agreement, Evergy delivered its shares to the financial institution in exchange for a series of cash settlements totaling $ 15.1 million based primarily on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the shares over the term of the agreement, which was completed in June 2022. As a result of the completion of the share forward agreement, Evergy no longer has an equity investment in the company. \n\nIn 2022, Evergy recorded a pre-tax loss of $ 16.3 million in investment earnings on its consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to the decrease in market value of its equity investment prior to sale and the settlement of the share forward agreement. \n\nRenewable Generation Investment \n\nIn August 2022, Evergy Missouri West entered into an agreement with a renewable energy development company to purchase for approximately $ 250 million an operational wind farm located in the state of Oklahoma with a generating capacity of approximately 199 MW. The purchase is subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the granting of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) by the MPSC. In January 2023, the MPSC staff recommended the MPSC reject Evergy Missouri West's application for a CCN and allow it to file a new application with updated economic analyses of the renewable generation investment or alternatively extend the procedural schedule to allow the MPSC staff time to evaluate the current economic analyses prepared by Evergy Missouri West. A final decision by the MPSC is expected in the first half of 2023. \n\n2.

The Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of electricity to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice. Retail customers are billed monthly at the tariff rates approved by the KCC and MPSC based on customer kWh usage. \n\nRevenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by the Evergy Companies. Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month. This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs. The Evergy Companies' estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates. \n\nThe Evergy Companies also collect sales taxes and franchise fees from customers concurrent with revenue-producing activities that are levied by state and local governments. These items are excluded from revenue, and thus not reflected on the statements of income and comprehensive income, for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro. \n\nWholesale Revenues \n\nThe Evergy Companies' wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of wholesale power and capacity in circumstances when the power that the Evergy Companies generate is not required for customers in their service territory. These sales primarily occur within the SPP Integrated Marketplace. The Evergy Companies also purchase power from the SPP Integrated Marketplace and record sale and purchase activity on a net basis in wholesale revenue or fuel and purchased power expense. In addition, the Evergy Companies sell wholesale power and capacity through bilateral contracts to other counterparties, such as electric cooperatives, municipalities and other electric utilities. \n\nFor both wholesale sales to the SPP Integrated Marketplace and through bilateral contracts, the Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of wholesale electricity to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice. \n\nWholesale sales within the SPP Integrated Marketplace are billed weekly based on the fixed transaction price determined by the market at the time of the sale and the MWh quantity purchased. Wholesale sales from bilateral contracts are billed monthly based on the contractually determined transaction price and the kWh quantity purchased. \n\nTransmission Revenues \n\nThe Evergy Companies' transmission revenues are generated by the use of their transmission networks by the SPP. To enable optimal use of the diverse generating resources in the SPP region, the Evergy Companies, as well as other transmission owners, allow the SPP to access and operate their transmission networks. As new transmission lines are constructed, they are included in the transmission network available to the SPP. In exchange for providing access, the SPP pays the Evergy Companies consideration determined by formula rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which include the cost to construct and maintain the transmission lines and a return on investment. The price for access to the Evergy Companies' transmission networks are updated annually based on projected costs. Projections are updated to actual costs and the difference is included in subsequent year's prices. \n\nThe Evergy Companies have different treatment for their legacy transmission facilities within the SPP, which results in different levels of transmission revenue being received from the SPP. Evergy Kansas Central's transmission revenues from SPP include amounts that Evergy Kansas Central pays to the SPP on behalf of its retail electric customers for the use of Evergy Kansas Central's legacy transmission facilities. These transmission revenues are mostly offset by SPP network transmission cost expense that Evergy Kansas Central pays on behalf of its retail customers. Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West do not pay the SPP for their retail customers&#8217; use of the Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West legacy transmission facilities and correspondingly, their transmission revenues also do not reflect the associated transmission revenue from the SPP. \n\nThe Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of transmission service to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice. Transmission service to the SPP is billed monthly based on a fixed transaction price determined by FERC formula transmission rates along with other SPP-specific charges and the MW quantity purchased. \n\nIndustrial Steam and Other Revenues \n\nEvergy's industrial steam and other revenues are primarily generated by the regulated sale of industrial steam to Evergy Missouri West's steam customers. Evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of industrial steam to its customers over time as the service is provided in the amount that it has the right to invoice. Steam customers are billed on a monthly basis at the tariff rate approved by the MPSC based on customer MMBtu usage. \n\n3. RECEIVABLES \n\nThe Evergy Companies' receivables are detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 Evergy (millions) Customer accounts receivable - billed $ 8.9 &#160; $ 13.7 &#160; Customer accounts receivable - unbilled 136.9 &#160; 80.1 &#160; Other receivables 200.9 &#160; 160.7 &#160; Allowance for credit losses ( 31.4 ) ( 32.9 ) Total $ 315.3 &#160; $ 221.6 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central Customer accounts receivable - billed $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9.7 &#160; Customer accounts receivable - unbilled 71.4 &#160; 26.4 &#160; Other receivables 194.9 &#160; 178.5 &#160; Allowance for credit losses ( 16.9 ) ( 13.0 ) Total $ 249.4 &#160; $ 201.6 &#160; Evergy Metro &#160; &#160; Customer accounts receivable - billed $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2.7 &#160; Customer accounts receivable - unbilled 25.5 &#160; 25.9 &#160; Other receivables 21.6 &#160; 15.7 &#160; Allowance for credit losses ( 9.3 ) ( 13.3 ) Total $ 37.8 &#160; $ 31.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Evergy Companies' other receivables at December 31, 2022 and 2021, consisted primarily of receivables from partners in jointly-owned electric utility plants, wholesale sales receivables and receivables related to alternative revenue programs. The Evergy Companies' other receivables also included receivables from contracts with customers as summarized in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 (millions) Evergy $ 113.0 &#160; $ 63.7 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central 110.8 &#160; 62.6 &#160; Evergy Metro 1.3 &#160; 0.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe change in the Evergy Companies' allowance for credit losses is summarized in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Evergy (millions) Beginning balance January 1 $ 32.9 &#160; $ 19.3 &#160; Credit loss expense 16.1 &#160; 28.0 &#160; Write-offs ( 28.8 ) ( 26.4 ) Recoveries of prior write-offs 11.2 &#160; 12.0 &#160; Ending balance December 31 $ 31.4 &#160; $ 32.9 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central Beginning balance January 1 $ 13.0 &#160; $ 7.5 &#160; Credit loss expense 13.1 &#160; 12.0 &#160; Write-offs ( 13.7 ) ( 11.0 ) Recoveries of prior write-offs 4.5 &#160; 4.5 &#160; Ending balance December 31 $ 16.9 &#160; $ 13.0 &#160; Evergy Metro Beginning balance January 1 $ 13.3 &#160; $ 8.1 &#160; Credit loss expense 1.7 &#160; 10.5 &#160; Write-offs ( 10.2 ) ( 10.6 ) Recoveries of prior write-offs 4.5 &#160; 5.3 &#160; Ending balance December 31 $ 9.3 &#160; $ 13.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSale of Accounts Receivable \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in their retail electric accounts receivable to independent outside investors. These sales are accounted for as secured borrowings with accounts receivable pledged as collateral and a corresponding short-term collateralized note payable recognized on the balance sheets.

RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION \n\nKCC Proceedings \n\nEvergy Kansas Central 2022 Transmission Delivery Charge (TDC) \n\nIn March 2022, the KCC issued an order adjusting Evergy Kansas Central's retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the FERC transmission formula rate (TFR). The new prices were effective in April 2022 and are expected to increase Evergy Kansas Central's annual retail revenues by $ 20.4 million when compared to 2021. \n\nEvergy Metro 2022 TDC \n\nIn April 2022, the KCC issued an order adjusting Evergy Metro's retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the FERC TFR. The new prices were effective in May 2022 and are expected to increase Evergy Metro's annual retail revenues by $ 7.9 million when compared to 2021. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro Earnings Review and Sharing Plan (ERSP) \n\nAs part of their merger settlement agreement with the KCC, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro agreed to participate in an ERSP for the years 2019 through 2022. Under the ERSP, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas jurisdiction are required to refund to customers 50 % of annual earnings in excess of their authorized return on equity of 9.3 % to the extent the excess earnings exceed the amount of annual bill credits that Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro agreed to provide in connection with the merger that resulted in the formation of Evergy. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's 2021 calculations of annual earnings did not result in a refund obligation. These calculations were filed with the KCC in March 2022. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy Kansas Central estimates its 2022 annual earnings will not result in a refund obligation. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy Metro estimates its 2022 annual earnings will result in a $ 16.7 million refund obligation, which was recorded as a reduction of operating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 on Evergy's and Evergy Metro's consolidated statements of consolidated income and comprehensive income. The final refund obligations for 2022 will be decided by the KCC and could vary from the current estimates. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro February 2021 Winter Weather Event AAO \n\nIn February 2021, the KCC issued an emergency AAO directing all Kansas-jurisdictional natural gas and electric utilities, including Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro, to defer to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability any extraordinary costs or revenues, including carrying costs, to provide electric service during the February 2021 winter weather event for consideration in future rate proceedings. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central recognized a regulatory asset pursuant to the AAO of approximately $ 120 million related to its costs incurred during the February 2021 winter weather event, primarily consisting of increased fuel, purchased power, and associated carrying costs. Evergy Metro's Kansas jurisdiction recognized a regulatory liability of approximately $ 40 million related to its increased wholesale revenues during the February 2021 winter weather event and associated carrying costs. \n\nIn July 2021, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro made a joint filing with the KCC regarding the timing and method of recovery or refund for costs and revenues deferred pursuant to the February 2021 winter weather event AAO. In the filing, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro requested to recover or refund, as appropriate, their deferred February 2021 winter weather event amounts to customers through their fuel recovery mechanisms over two years and one year, respectively, beginning in April 2023. As part of the filing, Evergy Metro also requested a decrease to its February 2021 winter weather event refund to Kansas customers, not currently reflected in its regulatory liability for the February 2021 winter weather event, for jurisdictional allocation differences in its Kansas and Missouri fuel recovery mechanisms. \n\nIn April 2022, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro, KCC staff and other intervenors filed a non-unanimous stipulation and agreement with the KCC that resolved all issues regarding the timing and method of recovery for costs and revenues deferred pursuant to the February 2021 winter weather event AAO. As part of the non-unanimous stipulation and agreement, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro agreed to recover or refund, as appropriate, their deferred February 2021 winter weather amounts to customers through their fuel recovery mechanisms over two years and one year, respectively, beginning in April 2023, and to use the rate of 1.00 % to apply carrying charges to these deferred amounts. The non-unanimous stipulation and agreement also permitted Evergy Metro to request the future recovery in its next Kansas rate case of an approximately $ 5 million under-recovery related to its February 2021 winter weather event refund to Kansas customers for jurisdictional allocation differences in its Kansas and Missouri fuel recovery mechanisms. \n\nIn June 2022, the KCC issued an order approving the non-unanimous stipulation and agreement. \n\nMPSC Proceedings \n\nEvergy Metro 2022 Rate Case Proceeding \n\nIn January 2022, Evergy Metro filed an application with the MPSC to request an increase to its retail revenues of $ 43.9 million before rebasing fuel and purchased power expense, with a return on equity of 10 % and a rate-making equity ratio of 51.19 %. The request reflected increases related to higher property taxes and the recovery of infrastructure investments made to improve reliability and enhance customer service and were also partially offset by significant customer savings and cost reductions created since the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger in 2018. Evergy Metro also requested an additional $ 3.8 million increase associated with rebasing fuel and purchased power expense as well as the implementation of tracking mechanisms for both property tax expense and credit loss expense and the creation of a storm reserve as part of its application with the MPSC. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, Evergy Metro, MPSC staff and other intervenors in the case reached several non-unanimous partial stipulations and agreements to settle certain issues in the case. In September 2022, the MPSC issued an order approving the partial non-unanimous stipulations and agreements. \n\nIn December 2022, the MPSC issued an amended final rate order settling the remaining issues in the case. The order and prior partial stipulations and agreements approved by the MPSC provide for an increase to Evergy Metro's retail revenues of $ 25.0 million after rebasing fuel and purchased power expense. Also included in the final order was a disallowance related to the recovery of costs associated with the replacement of certain electric meters. As a result of this disallowance, Evergy and Evergy Metro recorded a loss of $ 5.5 million within other regulatory disallowances on their consolidated statements of comprehensive income for 2022. The rates established by the final rate order took effect in January 2023. \n\nEvergy Missouri West 2022 Rate Case Proceeding \n\nIn January 2022, Evergy Missouri West filed an application with the MPSC to request an increase to its retail revenues of $ 27.7 million before rebasing fuel and purchased power expense, with a return on equity of 10 % and a rate-making equity ratio of 51.81 %. The request reflected increases related to higher property taxes and the recovery of infrastructure investments made to improve reliability and enhance customer service and were also partially offset by significant customer savings and cost reductions created since the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger in 2018. Evergy Missouri West also requested an additional $ 32.1 million increase associated with rebasing fuel and purchased power expense, the implementation of tracking mechanisms for both property tax expense and credit loss expense, the creation of a storm reserve, and the full return of and return on its unrecovered investment related to the 2018 retirement of Sibley Station as part of its application with the MPSC. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, Evergy Missouri West, MPSC staff and other intervenors in the case reached several non-unanimous partial stipulations and agreements to settle certain issues in the case. In September 2022, the MPSC issued an order approving the partial non-unanimous stipulations and agreements. \n\nIn December 2022, the MPSC issued an amended final rate order settling the remaining issues in the case, including the treatment of Evergy Missouri West's unrecovered investment in Sibley Station. The order and prior partial stipulations and agreements approved by the MPSC provide for an increase to Evergy Missouri West's retail revenues of $ 30.1 million after rebasing fuel and purchased power expense. The order determined that Evergy Missouri West will be allowed to collect $ 182.3 million ($ 173.6 million attributable to Sibley Unit 3) from customers over a period of eight years as a recovery of its existing investment in Sibley Station but will not be allowed to collect the return on its unrecovered investment in Sibley Station. The order also required Evergy Missouri West to refund to customers all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs and other costs associated with Sibley Station following its retirement in November 2018 over a period of four years. Also included in the final order was a disallowance related to the recovery of costs associated with the replacement of certain electric meters. \n\nAs a result of the amended final order, Evergy recorded a $ 68.0 million reduction to operating revenues and a corresponding increase to its Sibley AAO regulatory liability for revenues collected from customers for return on investment in Sibley Station since December 2018, which had not previously been recorded as they were not determined to be probable of refund, a $ 26.7 million impairment loss on Sibley Unit 3 and a $ 2.7 million other regulatory disallowance related to the recovery of costs associated with the replacement of certain meters on its consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining net book value of Sibley Unit 3 was $ 146.3 million, which is representative of the $ 173.6 million unrecovered investment in Sibley Unit 3 determined by the MPSC in its December 2022 order less the 2022 impairment loss recorded and other amortization expense. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy's Sibley AAO regulatory liability was $ 108.0 million. The rates established by this order took effect in January 2023. \n\nEvergy Missouri West Other Proceedings \n\nIn December 2018, the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC) and the Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG) filed a petition with the MPSC requesting an AAO that would require Evergy Missouri West to record a regulatory liability for all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, taxes including accumulated deferred income taxes, and all other costs associated with Sibley Station following the station&#8217;s retirement in November 2018. \n\nIn October 2019, the MPSC granted OPC's and MECG's request for an AAO and required Evergy Missouri West to record a regulatory liability for the revenues discussed above for consideration in Evergy Missouri West's current rate case. Subsequent to the MPSC order in 2019, Evergy recorded a regulatory liability for the estimated amount of revenues that Evergy Missouri West had collected from customers for Sibley Station since December 2018 that Evergy had determined was probable of refund. This regulatory liability did not include revenues collected related to the return on investment in Sibley Station as Evergy determined that they were not probable of refund based on the relevant facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2021, this Sibley AAO regulatory liability was $ 29.3 million. \n\nAs a result of the Evergy Missouri West current rate case determination, Evergy recorded an additional $ 68.0 million deferral to its Sibley AAO regulatory liability in 2022 for revenues collected from customers for return on investment in Sibley Station since December 2018. See \"Evergy Missouri West 2022 Rate Case Proceeding\" within this Note 4 for additional information. \n\nEvergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West February 2021 Winter Weather Event AAO \n\nIn June 2021, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West filed a joint request for an AAO with the MPSC that would allow Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to defer to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability any extraordinary costs or revenues, including carrying costs, to provide electric service during the February 2021 winter weather event for consideration in future proceedings. \n\nEvergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West initially deferred substantially all of their fuel and purchased power costs, net of wholesale revenues, related to the February 2021 winter weather event to a regulatory asset or liability pursuant to their ability to recover or refund these amounts through their fuel recovery mechanisms, which allow for the recovery or refund of 95 % of increases in fuel and purchased power costs, net of wholesale revenues, above the amount included in base rates to customers. This AAO request is intended to address the recovery or refund of the February 2021 winter weather event amounts separate from the normal fuel recovery mechanism process given the extraordinary nature of the February 2021 winter weather event and to help moderate customer bill impacts. Evergy Metro's Missouri jurisdiction recognized a regulatory liability of approximately $ 25 million related to its increased wholesale revenues during the February 2021 winter weather event. Evergy Missouri West recognized a regulatory asset of approximately $ 280 million related to its costs incurred during the February 2021 winter weather event, primarily consisting of increased fuel and purchased power costs. \n\nIn the AAO filing, Evergy Metro requested to refund its deferred February 2021 winter weather event amounts to customers through its fuel recovery mechanism over one year, beginning in April 2022. In the same AAO filing, Evergy Missouri West requested to exclude its deferred February 2021 winter weather event amounts from recovery through its fuel recovery mechanism and indicated its intent to recover them through issuing securitized bonds \n\npursuant to the securitization legislation signed into law in Missouri in July 2021. As part of the filing, Evergy Metro also requested an approximately $ 5 million decrease to its February 2021 winter weather refund to Missouri customers, which is not currently reflected in its regulatory liability for the February 2021 winter weather event, for jurisdictional allocation differences in its Kansas and Missouri fuel recovery mechanisms and for the portion of net wholesale revenues not traditionally refundable because of the 5 % sharing provision of its fuel recovery mechanism. Evergy Missouri West requested an approximately $ 15 million increase to its February 2021 winter weather event recovery from Missouri customers, which is not currently reflected in its regulatory asset for the February 2021 winter weather event, for the portion of net fuel and purchased power costs not traditionally recoverable because of the 5 % sharing provision of its fuel recovery mechanism. \n\nIn March 2022, the MPSC ordered Evergy Metro in a separate regulatory proceeding to file an adjustment to its fuel recovery mechanism in order to allow its wholesale revenues from the February 2021 winter weather event to be refunded to customers beginning in April 2022. The approximately $ 5 million decrease to the refund of February 2021 winter weather amounts requested by Evergy Metro due to jurisdictional allocation differences in its Kansas and Missouri fuel recovery mechanisms was not included in the adjustment. \n\nIn April 2022, the MPSC staff filed a motion to suspend the February 2021 winter weather event AAO procedural schedule for Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West pending the resolution of Evergy Missouri West's petition for a securitization financing order discussed below. The MPSC granted the motion to suspend the AAO procedural schedule in April 2022. Evergy Metro began refunding the Missouri portion of its wholesale revenues from the February 2021 winter weather event to customers through its fuel recovery mechanism in April 2022. \n\nEvergy Missouri West February 2021 Winter Weather Event Securitization \n\nIn March 2022, Evergy Missouri West filed a petition for financing order with the MPSC requesting authorization to finance its extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event, including carrying costs, through the issuance of securitized bonds. Evergy Missouri West requested to repay the securitized bonds and collect the related amounts from customers over a period of approximately 15 years from the date of issuance of the securitized bonds. \n\nIn November 2022, the MPSC issued a revised financing order authorizing Evergy Missouri West to issue securitized bonds to recover its extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event. As part of this order, the MPSC found that Evergy Missouri West's costs were prudently incurred, that it should only be allowed to recover 95% of its extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs consistent with the 5% sharing provision of its fuel recovery mechanism, that it should be allowed to recover carrying costs incurred since February 2021 at Evergy Missouri West's long-term debt rate of 5.06 % and approved a 15 year repayment period for the bonds with a 17 year legal maturity. In the third quarter of 2022, Evergy Missouri West recorded an increase of $ 15.0 million to its February 2021 winter weather event regulatory asset for the recovery of carrying charges granted in the MPSC's financing order. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the value of Evergy Missouri West's February 2021 winter weather event regulatory asset was $ 309.0 million and $ 281.6 million, respectively. Evergy Missouri West will continue to record carrying charges on its February 2021 winter weather event regulatory asset until it issues the securitized bonds. \n\nIn January 2023, the OPC filed an appeal with the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, challenging the financing order regarding the treatment of income tax deductions, carrying costs and discount rates related to the financing of the extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event. A final nonappealable financing order is required prior to the issuance of securitized bonds. A decision by the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, is currently expected in the second half of 2023, though the timeline for the decision is uncertain. \n\nFERC Proceedings \n\nIn October of each year, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro post an updated TFR that includes projected transmission capital expenditures and operating costs for the following year. This rate is the most significant component in the retail rate calculation for Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's annual request with the KCC to adjust retail prices to include updated transmission costs through the TDC. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central TFR Annual Update \n\nIn the most recent three years, the updated TFR was expected to adjust Evergy Kansas Central's annual transmission revenues by approximately: \n\n&#8226; $ 38.7 million increase effective in January 2023; \n\n&#8226; $ 33.2 million increase effective in January 2022; and \n\n&#8226; $ 32.4 million increase effective in January 2021. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central TFR Formal Challenge \n\nIn March 2022, certain Evergy Kansas Central TFR customers submitted a formal challenge regarding the implementation of Evergy Kansas Central's TFR, specifically with regards to how Evergy Kansas Central's capital structure was calculated as part of determining the Annual Transmission Revenue Requirement (ATRR). As part of this challenge, the customers requested that Evergy Kansas Central make refunds for over-collections in rate years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as a result of the calculation of its capital structure included in the TFR. Evergy Kansas Central disputed that any refunds for 2018 - 2022 were required as Evergy Kansas Central was following its approved TFR formula. \n\nIn December 2022, FERC issued an order upholding in part, and denying in part, the formal challenge of Evergy Kansas Central's TFR by certain customers. The order required Evergy Kansas Central to refund over-collections related to the calculation of its capital structure for the rate years 2020, 2021 and 2022, with interest. The order also denied approving the refund of 2018 and 2019 amounts as part of the formal challenge on a procedural basis but indicated that the customers could pursue a refund of over collections for these rate years through a separate FERC filing. As a result of this order, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central recorded a $ 32.8 million decrease to operating revenues on their consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for 2022 for the deferral to a regulatory liability of the estimated refund of TFR revenue over-collections related to the calculation of Evergy Kansas Central's capital structure for rate years 2018 - 2022. Evergy Kansas Central currently expects that the refund of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 over-collections will occur as part of its 2023 TFR. Evergy Kansas Central's calculation of its estimated refund to TFR customers must still be reviewed and approved by FERC, and that estimate could change based on that review. \n\nEvergy Metro TFR Annual Update \n\nIn the most recent three years, the updated TFR was expected to adjust Evergy Metro's annual transmission revenues by approximately: \n\n&#8226; $ 8.6 million increase effective in January 2023; \n\n&#8226; $ 18.1 million increase effective in January 2022; and \n\n&#8226; $ 3.9 million decrease effective in January 2021. \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities \n\nThe Evergy Companies have recorded assets and liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded if they were not regulated. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues. Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers. \n\nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to the Evergy Companies; and changes in laws and regulations. If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations. The Evergy Companies continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules. In the event that the criteria no longer applied to any or all of the Evergy Companies' operations, the related regulatory \n\nassets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided. Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in the following tables. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 Evergy Evergy Kansas Central Evergy Metro Evergy Evergy Kansas Central Evergy Metro Regulatory Assets (millions) Pension and post-retirement costs $ 137.3 &#160;

See \"Evergy Kansas Central TFR Formal Challenge\" within this Note 4 for additional information. \n\nOther regulatory liabilities: Includes various regulatory liabilities that individually are relatively small in relation to the total regulatory liability balance. These amounts will be credited over various periods. \n\n5. GOODWILL \n\nGAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. Evergy's impairment test for the $ 2,336.6 million of goodwill that was recorded as a result of the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger was conducted as of May 1, 2022. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. Evergy's consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. The determination of fair value of the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill. \n\n6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS \n\nAROs associated with tangible long-lived assets are legal obligations that exist under enacted laws, statutes and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. These liabilities are recognized at estimated fair value as incurred with a corresponding amount capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful lives. Accretion of the liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded to a regulatory asset and/or liability. Changes in the estimated fair values of the liabilities are recognized when known. \n\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have AROs related to asbestos abatement and the closure and post-closure care of ponds and landfills containing coal combustion residuals (CCRs). In addition, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro have AROs related to decommissioning Wolf Creek and the retirement of wind generation facilities. \n\nThe following table summarizes the change in the Evergy Companies' AROs for the periods ending December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Evergy Evergy Kansas Central Evergy Metro 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 (millions) Beginning balance January 1 $ 960.1 &#160; $ 941.9 &#160; $ 443.9 &#160; $ 427.2 &#160; $ 381.0 &#160; $ 378.9 &#160; Revision in timing and/or estimates 161.8 &#160; 13.5 &#160; 103.1 &#160; 3.8 &#160; 51.3 &#160; 9.5 &#160; Settlements ( 13.0 ) ( 38.7 ) ( 6.9 ) ( 10.6 ) ( 5.3 ) ( 24.4 ) Accretion 44.3 &#160; 43.4 &#160; 25.0 &#160; 23.5 &#160; 17.2 &#160; 17.0 &#160; Ending balance $ 1,153.2 &#160; $ 960.1 &#160; $ 565.1 &#160; $ 443.9 &#160; $ 444.2 &#160; $ 381.0 &#160; Less: current portion ( 40.4 ) ( 19.5 ) ( 21.3 ) ( 7.3 ) ( 17.1 ) ( 11.0 ) Total noncurrent asset retirement obligation $ 1,112.8 &#160; $ 940.6 &#160; $ 543.8 &#160; $ 436.6 &#160; $ 427.1 &#160; $ 370.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2022, the Evergy Companies completed an engineering study that resulted in recording revisions in estimates for AROs at ponds and landfills containing CCRs, primarily at La Cygne Station and JEC, driven by higher cost estimates primarily due to increased scope of surface area remediation, cost inflation and changes in assumed method of closure at certain sites, among other factors. \n\n7.

The Evergy Companies' share of direct expenses are included in the appropriate operating expense classifications in Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated financial statements. \n\n9. PENSION PLANS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS \n\nEvergy and certain of its subsidiaries maintain, and Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro participate in, qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's employees as well as certain non-qualified plans covering certain active and retired officers. Evergy is also responsible for its indirect 94 % ownership share of Wolf Creek's defined benefit plans, consisting of Evergy Kansas South's and Evergy Metro's respective 47 % ownership shares. \n\nFor the majority of employees, pension benefits under these plans reflect the employees' compensation, years of service and age at retirement. However, for the plan covering Evergy Kansas Central's employees, the benefits for non-union employees hired between 2002 and the second quarter of 2018 and union employees hired beginning in 2012 are derived from a cash balance account formula. The plan was closed to future non-union employees in 2018. For the plans covering Evergy Metro's employees, the benefits for union employees hired beginning in 2014 are derived from a cash balance account formula and the plans were closed to future non-union employees in 2014. \n\nEvergy and its subsidiaries also provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro and their respective shares of Wolf Creek's post-retirement benefit plans. \n\nThe Evergy Companies record pension and post-retirement expense in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC that allow the difference between pension and post-retirement costs under GAAP and costs for ratemaking to be recognized as a regulatory asset or liability. This difference between financial and regulatory accounting methods is due to timing and will be eliminated over the life of the plans. \n\nFor 2022, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded pension and post-retirement special termination benefits of $ 59.5 million, $ 17.0 million and $ 42.5 million, respectively. For 2021, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement charges of $ 34.3 million, $ 25.6 million and $ 13.7 million, respectively. For 2020, Evergy and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement charges of $ 11.2 million and $ 14.3 million, respectively. These settlement charges and special termination benefits were the result of accelerated and enhanced pension distributions as a result of employee retirements and annuity purchases for certain plan participants. Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro deferred substantially all of the charges to a regulatory asset and expect to recover these amounts over future periods pursuant to regulatory agreements. \n\nThe following pension benefits tables provide information relating to the funded status of all defined benefit pension plans on an aggregate basis as well as the components of net periodic benefit costs. For financial reporting purposes, the market value of plan assets is the fair value. Net periodic benefit costs reflect total plan benefit costs prior to the effects of capitalization and sharing with joint owners of power plants. \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits Post-Retirement Benefits Evergy Evergy Kansas Central Evergy Metro Evergy Evergy Kansas Central Evergy Metro Change in projected benefit obligation (PBO) (millions) PBO at January 1, 2022 $ 2,561.7 &#160;

EQUITY COMPENSATION \n\nEvergy's Long-Term Incentive Plan is an equity compensation plan approved by Evergy shareholders. The Long-Term Incentive Plan permits the grant of restricted stock, restricted stock units, bonus shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights, director shares, director deferred share units and performance shares to directors, officers and other employees of Evergy. Common stock shares delivered by Evergy under the Long-Term Incentive Plan may be authorized but unissued, held in the treasury or purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws. Evergy has a policy of delivering newly issued shares and does not expect to repurchase common shares during 2023 to satisfy equity compensation payments and director deferred share unit conversion. Evergy recognizes forfeitures as they occur. \n\nThe following table summarizes the Evergy Companies' equity compensation expense and the associated income tax benefit. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Evergy (millions) Equity compensation expense $ 18.8 &#160; $ 15.6 &#160; $ 15.5 &#160; Income tax (expense) benefit 2.6 &#160; ( 0.1 ) 2.2 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central Equity compensation expense 8.4 &#160; 6.9 &#160; 7.6 &#160; Income tax (expense) benefit 1.7 &#160; ( 0.2 ) 1.6 &#160; Evergy Metro Equity compensation expense 6.0 &#160; 5.1 &#160; 5.7 &#160; Income tax (expense) benefit 0.2 &#160; ( 0.6 ) 0.2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRestricted Share Units \n\nEvergy utilizes RSUs for new grants of stock-based compensation awards. RSU awards are grants that entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock as the awards vest. These RSU awards are defined as nonvested shares and do not include restrictions once the awards have vested. These RSUs either take the form of RSUs with performance measures that vest upon the achievement of specific performance goals or RSUs with only service requirements that vest solely upon the passage of time. \n\nRSUs with Performance Measures \n\nThe payment of RSUs with performance measures is contingent upon achievement of specific performance goals over a stated period of time as approved by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board. The numbers of RSUs with performances measures ultimately paid can vary from the numbers of RSUs with performance measures initially granted depending on Evergy's performance over the stated performance periods. Compensation expense for RSUs with performance measures is calculated by recognizing the portion of the fair value for each reporting period for which the requisite service has been rendered. Dividends are accrued over the vesting period and paid in cash based on the number of RSUs with performance measures ultimately paid. \n\nThe fair value of RSUs with performance measures is estimated using the market value of Evergy's stock at the valuation date and a Monte Carlo simulation technique that incorporates assumptions for inputs of expected \n\nvolatilities, dividend yield and risk-free rates. Expected volatility is based on daily stock price change during a historical period commensurate with the remaining term of the performance period of the grant. The risk-free rate is based upon the rate at the time of the evaluation for zero-coupon government bonds with a maturity consistent with the remaining performance period of the grant. The dividend yield is based on the most recent dividends paid and the actual closing stock price on the valuation date. For shares granted in 2022, inputs for expected volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free rate were 32 %, 3.76 % and 1.45 %, respectively. \n\nRSU activity for awards with performance measures for 2022 is summarized in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Nonvested Restricted Share Units Grant Date Fair Value* Beginning balance January 1, 2022 513,715 &#160; $ 58.79 &#160; Granted 238,542 &#160; 57.95 &#160; Vested ( 146,115 ) 37.87 &#160; Forfeited ( 59,244 ) 61.28 &#160; Ending balance December 31, 2022 546,898 &#160; 63.57 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n* weighted-average \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the remaining weighted-average contractual term related to RSU awards with performance measures was 1.4 years. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted with performance measures was $ 57.95 , $ 57.21 and $ 87.98 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, there was $ 14.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs with performance measures. The total fair value of RSUs with performance measures that vested was $ 5.5 million in 2022 and no RSUs with performance measures vested in 2021 and 2020. \n\nRSUs with Only Service Requirements \n\nEvergy measures the fair value of RSUs with only service requirements based on the fair market value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date. RSU awards with only service conditions recognize compensation expense by multiplying shares by the grant-date fair value related to the RSU and recognizing it on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Dividends are accrued over the vesting period and are invested in additional RSU's subject to the same service conditions. \n\nRSU activity for awards with only service requirements for 2022 is summarized in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Nonvested Restricted Share Units Grant Date Fair Value* Beginning balance January 1, 2022 253,046 &#160; $ 57.18 &#160; Granted 91,764 &#160; 60.93 &#160; Vested ( 84,503 ) 55.81 &#160; Forfeited ( 20,812 ) 56.41 &#160; Ending balance December 31, 2022 239,495 &#160; 58.98 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n* weighted-average \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the remaining weighted-average contractual term related to RSU awards with only service requirements was 1.4 years. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted with only service requirements was $ 60.93 , $ 55.30 and $ 68.92 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, there was $ 6.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs. The total fair value of RSUs with only service requirements that vested was $ 4.7 million, $ 2.4 million and $ 6.5 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nIn addition to RSU's, Evergy also had 36,012 shares and 108,010 shares of restricted stock and performance shares, respectively, that vested in 2021 related to Great Plains Energy equity compensation awards that converted to equivalent Evergy awards at the closing of the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger in 2018. \n\n11. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND SHORT-TERM BANK LINES OF CREDIT \n\nEvergy's $ 2.5 billion master credit facility expires in 2026. Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility with specific sublimits for each borrower. These sublimits can be unilaterally adjusted by Evergy for each borrower provided the sublimits remain within minimum and maximum sublimits as specified in the facility. The applicable interest rates and commitment fees of the facility are subject to upward or downward adjustments, within certain limitations, if Evergy achieves, or fails to achieve, certain sustainability-linked targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) Non-Emitting Generation Capacity and (ii) Diverse Supplier Spend (as defined in the facility). \n\nA default by any borrower under the facility or one of its significant subsidiaries on other indebtedness totaling more than $ 100.0 million constitutes a default by that borrower under the facility. Under the terms of this facility, each of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West is required to maintain a total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio, as defined in the facility, of not greater than 0.65 to 1.00 at all times. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West were in compliance with this covenant. \n\nThe following table summarizes the committed credit facilities (excluding receivable sale facilities discussed in Note 3) available to the Evergy Companies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Amounts Drawn Master Credit Facility Commercial Paper Letters of Credit Cash Borrowings Available Borrowings Weighted Average Interest Rate on Short-Term Borrowings December 31, 2022 (millions) Evergy, Inc. $ 450.0 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 0.7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 449.3 &#160; &#8212; % Evergy Kansas Central 1,000.0 &#160; 772.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 227.9 &#160; 4.91 % Evergy Metro 350.0 &#160; 111.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 239.0 &#160; 5.02 % Evergy Missouri West 700.0 &#160; 449.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 250.8 &#160; 4.84 % Evergy $ 2,500.0 &#160; $ 1,332.3 &#160; $ 0.7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,167.0 &#160; December 31, 2021 Evergy, Inc. $ 700.0 &#160; $ 358.0 &#160; $ 0.7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 341.3 &#160; 0.34 % Evergy Kansas Central 750.0 &#160; 406.0 &#160; 0.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 343.9 &#160; 0.41 % Evergy Metro 350.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 350.0 &#160; &#8212; % Evergy Missouri West 700.0 &#160; 395.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 304.7 &#160; 0.40 % Evergy $ 2,500.0 &#160; $ 1,159.3 &#160; $ 0.8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,339.9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn February 2022, Evergy, Inc. entered into a $ 500.0 million unsecured Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan Facility) that originally expired in February 2023. In February 2023, Evergy, Inc. amended the $ 500.0 million Term Loan Facility to expire in February 2024. As a result of the amendment, Evergy, Inc. demonstrated its intent and ability to refinance the Term Loan Facility and reflected this $500 million borrowing within long-term debt, net, on Evergy's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2022, was 5.12 %. Evergy's borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility contains customary covenants, including one that sets the ratio of maximum allowed total indebtedness to total capitalization of not greater than 0.65 to 1.00, for Evergy and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy was in compliance with this covenant. \n\n12.

Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South must be in compliance with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness. The amount of Evergy Kansas Central FMBs authorized by its Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated July 1, 1939, as supplemented, is subject to certain limitations as described below. The amount of Evergy Kansas South FMBs authorized by the Evergy Kansas South Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated April 1, 1940, as supplemented and amended, is limited to a maximum of $ 3.5 billion, unless amended further. FMBs are secured by utility assets. Amounts of additional FMBs that may be issued are subject to property, earnings and certain restrictive provisions, except in connection with certain refundings, of each mortgage. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 416.4 million and $ 2,828.6 million principal amounts of additional Evergy Kansas Central FMBs or Evergy Kansas South FMBs, respectively, could be issued under the most restrictive provisions of their mortgages. \n\nEvergy Metro has issued mortgage bonds under the Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture, which creates a mortgage lien on substantially all Evergy Metro's utility plant. Additional Evergy Metro bonds may be issued on the basis of 75 % of property additions or retired bonds. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 5,254.1 million principal amount of additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage. \n\nIn March 2022, Evergy Missouri West entered into a First Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of March 1, 2022 (Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture), establishing a first mortgage lien on substantially all of its present properties and certain after-acquired properties, subject to certain exceptions. In connection with the establishment of the Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture, Evergy Missouri West issued collateral mortgage bonds secured by the Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture to serve as collateral for Evergy Missouri West's obligations under the following outstanding unsecured senior notes: \n\n&#8226; $ 36.0 million of 3.49 % Series A, maturing in 2025; \n\n&#8226; $ 60.0 million of 4.06 % Series B, maturing in 2033; \n\n&#8226; $ 150.0 million of 4.74 % Series C, maturing in 2043; \n\n&#8226; $ 350.0 million of 2.86 % Series A, maturing in 2031; \n\n&#8226; $ 75.0 million of 3.01 % Series B, maturing in 2033; and \n\n&#8226; $ 75.0 million of 3.21 % Series C, maturing in 2036. \n\nUnder the Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture, additional Evergy Missouri West mortgage bonds may be issued on the basis of 75% of property additions or retired bonds. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 1,905.0 million principal amount of additional Evergy Missouri West mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage. \n\nThe collateral mortgage bonds were issued to the holders of the unsecured senior notes, are only payable if Evergy Missouri West defaults on the underlying unsecured senior notes and do not increase the amount of outstanding debt for Evergy Missouri West. \n\nAs a result of the above transactions, Evergy Missouri West's outstanding senior notes have effectively become secured by the mortgage lien of the Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture and rank equally and ratably with all of Evergy Missouri West's mortgage bonds, regardless of series, from time to time issued and outstanding under the Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture. \n\nAlso in March 2022, Evergy Missouri West issued, at a discount, $ 250.0 million of 3.75 % FMBs, maturing in 2032. \n\nIn December 2022, Evergy Missouri West issued, at a discount, $ 300.0 million of 5.15 % FMBs, maturing in 2027. \n\nSenior Notes \n\nUnder the terms of the note purchase agreements for certain Evergy Missouri West senior notes, Evergy Missouri West is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, not greater than 0.65 to 1.00. In addition, Evergy Missouri West's priority debt, as defined in the agreements, cannot exceed 15 % of consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreements. At December 31, 2022, Evergy Missouri West was in compliance with these covenants. \n\nIn March 2022, Evergy Missouri West repaid its $ 100.0 million of 3.74 % Senior Notes at maturity. \n\nIn June 2022, Evergy repaid its $ 287.5 million of 5.292 % Senior Notes at maturity. \n\nPollution Control Bonds \n\nIn July 2022, Evergy Metro remarketed its unsecured Series 2008 Environmental Improvement Revenue Refunding (EIRR) bonds maturing in 2038 totaling $ 23.4 million at a fixed rate of 3.50 % through June 30, 2025. \n\nScheduled Maturities \n\nEvergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's long-term debt maturities for the next five years are detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 (millions) Evergy $ 439.5 &#160; $ 1,300.0 &#160; $ 636.0 &#160; $ 350.0 &#160; $ 621.9 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central 50.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 250.0 &#160; 350.0 &#160; 321.9 &#160; Evergy Metro 379.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 350.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n13. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS \n\nThe Evergy Companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations, in addition to limited non-regulated energy marketing activities. These activities expose the Evergy Companies to market risks associated with the price of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products. Management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on the Evergy Companies' operating results. The Evergy Companies' commodity risk management activities, which are subject to the management, direction and control of an internal risk management committee, utilize derivative instruments to reduce the effects of fluctuations in wholesale sales and fuel and purchased power expense caused by commodity price volatility. \n\nThe Evergy Companies are also exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and may use derivative instruments to manage these risks. The Evergy Companies' interest rate risk management activities have included using derivative instruments to hedge against future interest rate fluctuations on anticipated debt issuances. \n\nThe Evergy Companies also engage in non-regulated energy marketing activity for trading purposes, primarily at Evergy Kansas Central, which focuses on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected changes in the market prices of commodities, primarily electricity and natural gas. \n\nThe Evergy Companies consider various qualitative factors, such as contract and marketplace attributes, in designating derivative instruments at inception. The Evergy Companies may elect the normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS) exception, which requires the effects of the derivative to be recorded when the underlying contract settles under accrual accounting. The Evergy Companies account for derivative instruments that are not designated as NPNS primarily as either economic hedges or trading contracts (non-hedging derivatives) which are recorded as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. See Note 14 for additional information on the \n\nEvergy Companies' methods for assessing the fair value of derivative instruments. Changes in the fair value of non-hedging derivatives that are related to the Evergy Companies&#8217; regulated operations are deferred to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability when determined to be probable of future recovery or refund from customers. Recovery of the actual costs incurred by regulated activities will not impact earnings but will impact cash flows due to the timing of the recovery mechanism. Cash flows for all derivative instruments are classified as operating activities on the Evergy Companies' statements of cash flows, with the exception of cash flows for interest rate swap agreements accounted for as cash flows hedges of forecasted debt transactions, which are recorded as financing activities. Changes in the fair value of non-hedging derivatives that are not related to the Evergy Companies' regulated operations are recorded in operating revenues on the Evergy Companies' statements of income and comprehensive income. \n\nThe Evergy Companies offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements, which include rights to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable), or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable). \n\nThe gross notional contract amount by commodity type for derivative instruments is summarized in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 Non-hedging derivatives Notional volume unit of measure 2022 2021 Evergy (millions) Commodity contracts Power MWhs 67.2 &#160; 59.8 &#160; Natural gas MMBtu 772.7 &#160; 375.6 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central Commodity contracts Power MWhs 41.6 &#160; 36.7 &#160; Natural gas MMBtu 769.6 &#160; 373.6 &#160; Evergy Metro Commodity contracts Power MWhs 18.2 &#160; 17.7 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair values of Evergy's open derivative positions and balance sheet classifications are summarized in the following tables.

The amount of gain (loss) recognized in income for the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for 2020 was not significant for the Evergy Companies. \n\n##TABLE_START Location of gain (loss) Contract type 2022 2021 Evergy (millions) Operating revenues Commodity $ 84.6 &#160; $ 117.5 &#160; Total $ 84.6 &#160; $ 117.5 &#160; Evergy Kansas Central Operating revenues Commodity $ 84.6 &#160; $ 117.5 &#160; Total $ 84.6 &#160; $ 117.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCredit risk of the Evergy Companies' derivative instruments relates to the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non-performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations. The Evergy Companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk mitigation, such as collateral requirements or letters of credit, when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure. Substantially all of the Evergy Companies' counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to Evergy Kansas Central's non-regulated energy marketing activities. As of December 31, 2022, if counterparty groups completely failed to perform on contracts, Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's maximum exposure related to derivative assets was $ 54.4 million. As of December 31, 2022, the potential loss after the consideration of applicable master netting arrangements and collateral received for Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central was not significant. \n\nCertain of the Evergy Companies' derivative instruments contain collateral provisions that are tied to the Evergy Companies' credit ratings and may require the posting of collateral for various reasons, including if the Evergy Companies' credit ratings were to fall below investment grade. Substantially all of these derivative instruments relate to Evergy Kansas Central's non-regulated energy marketing activities. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position as of December 31, 2022, was $ 47.1 million for which Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central have posted collateral of $ 7.1 million in the normal course of business. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were \n\ntriggered as of December 31, 2022, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central could be required to post an additional $ 34.3 million of collateral to their counterparties. \n\n14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nValues of Financial Instruments \n\nGAAP establishes a hierarchical framework for disclosing the transparency of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Management's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels. In addition, the Evergy Companies measure certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at NAV, which are not included in the fair value hierarchy. Further explanation of these levels and NAV is summarized below. \n\nLevel 1 &#8211; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on public exchanges or exchange-traded derivative instruments. \n\nLevel 2 &#8211; Pricing inputs are not quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are certain marketable debt securities, financial instruments traded in less than active markets, non-exchange traded derivative instruments with observable forward curves and options contracts. \n\nLevel 3 &#8211; Significant inputs to pricing have little or no transparency. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are non-exchange traded derivative instruments for which observable market data is not available to corroborate the valuation inputs and TCRs in the SPP Integrated Marketplace. \n\nNAV - Investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at NAV. These investments do not consider the observability of inputs and, therefore, they are not included within the fair value hierarchy. The Evergy Companies include in this category investments in private equity, real estate and alternative investment funds that do not have a readily determinable fair value.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nSet forth below are descriptions of contingencies related to environmental matters that may impact the Evergy Companies' operations or their financial results. Management's assessment of these contingencies, which are based on federal and state statutes and regulations, and regulatory agency and judicial interpretations and actions, has \n\nevolved over time. These laws, regulations, interpretations and actions can also change, restrict or otherwise impact the Evergy Companies' operations or financial results. The failure to comply with these laws, regulations, interpretations and actions could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the imposition of remedial requirements. The Evergy Companies believe that all of their operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards. \n\nThere are a variety of final and proposed laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Evergy Companies' operations and consolidated financial results. Due in part to the complex nature of environmental laws and regulations, the Evergy Companies are unable to assess the impact of potential changes that may develop with respect to the environmental contingencies described below. \n\nClean Air Act - Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction (SSM) Regulation \n\nIn 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule addressing how state implementation plans (SIPs) can treat excess emissions during SSM events. This rule was referred to as the 2015 SIP Call Rule. The rule required 36 states to submit SIP revisions by November 2016 to remove certain exemptions and other discretionary enforcement provisions that apply to excess emissions during SSM events. Legal challenges ensued and the case was eventually placed in abeyance. In December 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit) restarted the litigation and oral arguments were held in March 2022. An additional case was also taking place in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (District Court of Northern California) and in June 2022, the District Court of Northern California entered a final consent decree establishing deadlines for the EPA to take final action on SIP revisions that were submitted in response to the 2015 SIP Call Rule. Deadlines for 26 states and air districts, including Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, are listed in the final consent decree. Final action from the EPA could result in required SIP revisions in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri which could have a material impact on the Evergy Companies. If the D.C. Circuit overturns the EPA's 2015 SIP Call Rule, the final consent decree's deadlines will no longer be valid. \n\nOzone Interstate Transport State Implementation Plans (ITSIP) \n\nIn 2015, the EPA lowered the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. Impacted states were required to submit ITSIPs in 2018 to comply with the \"Good Neighbor Provisions\" of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA did not act on these ITSIP submissions and was challenged in a court filing in May 2021 to address them. In February 2022, the EPA published proposed disapprovals of ITSIPs for nineteen states including Missouri and Oklahoma. In April 2022, the EPA published a final approval of the Kansas ITSIP in the Federal Register. In June 2022, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) announced that it intended to submit a supplemental ITSIP to the EPA and placed the document on public notice until August 2022. MDNR submitted the supplemental ITSIP to the EPA on November 1, 2022. \n\nOzone Interstate Transport Federal Implementation Plans (ITFIP) \n\nIn April 2022, the EPA published in the Federal Register the proposed ITFIP to resolve outstanding \"Good Neighbor\" obligations with respect to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS for 26 states including Missouri and Oklahoma. This ITFIP would establish a revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) ozone season nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions trading program for electric generating units (EGUs), and would limit ozone season NOx emissions from certain industrial stationary sources. The proposed rule would also establish a new daily backstop NOx emissions rate limit for applicable coal-fired units larger than 100 MW, as well as unit-specific NOx emission rate limits for certain industrial emission units and would feature \"dynamic\" adjustments of emission budgets for EGUs beginning with ozone season 2025. The proposed ITFIP includes reductions to the state ozone season NOx budgets for Missouri and Oklahoma beginning in 2023 with additional reductions in future years. The Evergy Companies provided formal comments as part of the rulemaking process. The EPA intends to issue final ITFIPs for applicable states in March 2023. Due to uncertainty regarding the proposed ITFIP, the Evergy Companies are unable to accurately assess the impacts of these potential EPA actions on their operations or consolidated financial results, but the cost to comply with the ITFIP could be material. \n\nParticulate Matter and Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards \n\nIn January 2023, the EPA proposed strengthening the primary annual PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter) NAAQS. The EPA is proposing to lower the primary annual PM 2.5 NAAQS from 12.0 &#181;g/m3 \n\n(micrograms per cubic meter) to a level that would be between 9.0 and 10.0 &#181;g/m3. The EPA is proposing to retain the other PM NAAQS at their current levels. The EPA is also in the process of reconsidering its December 2020 decisions to retain each of the Ozone NAAQS at the level set in 2015. Due to uncertainty regarding the potential lowering of the ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS, the Evergy Companies are unable to accurately assess the impacts of these potential EPA actions on their operations or consolidated financial results, but the cost to comply with lower future ozone or PM 2.5 NAAQS could be material. \n\nRegional Haze Rule \n\nIn 1999, the EPA finalized the Regional Haze Rule which aims to restore national parks and wilderness areas to pristine conditions. The rule requires states in coordination with the EPA, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and other interested parties to develop and implement air quality protection plans to reduce the pollution that causes visibility impairment. There are 156 \"Class I\" areas across the U.S. that must be restored to pristine conditions by the year 2064. There are no Class I areas in Kansas, whereas Missouri has two: the Hercules-Glades Wilderness Area and the Mingo Wilderness Area. States must submit revisions to their Regional Haze Rule SIPs every ten years and the first round was due in 2007. For the second ten-year implementation period, the EPA issued a final rule revision in 2017 that allowed states to submit their SIP revisions by July 31, 2021. The Evergy Companies have been in contact with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and MDNR as they worked to draft their SIP revisions. The Missouri SIP revision does not require any additional reductions from the Evergy Companies' generating units in the state. MDNR submitted the Missouri SIP revision to the EPA in August 2022, however, they failed to do so by the EPA's revised submittal deadline of August 15, 2022. As a result, on August 30, 2022, the EPA published \"finding of failure\" with respect to Missouri and fourteen other states for failing to submit their Regional Haze SIP revisions by the applicable deadline. This finding of failure established a two-year deadline for the EPA to issue a Regional Haze federal implementation plan (FIP) for each state unless the state submits and the EPA approves a revised SIP that meets all applicable requirements before the EPA issues the FIP. The Kansas SIP revision was placed on public notice in June 2021 and requested no additional emission reductions by electric utilities based on the significant reductions that were achieved during the first implementation period. The EPA provided comments on the Kansas SIP revision in June 2021 that each state is statutorily required to conduct a \"four-factor analysis\" on at least two sources within the state to help determine if further emission reductions are necessary. The EPA also stated it would be difficult to approve the Kansas SIP revision if at least two four-factor analyses are not conducted on Kansas emission sources. KDHE submitted the Kansas SIP revision in July 2021. If a Kansas generating unit of the Evergy Companies is selected for analysis, the possibility exists that the state or EPA, through a revised SIP or a FIP, could determine that additional operational or physical modifications are required on the generating unit to further reduce emissions. The overall cost of those modifications could be material to the Evergy Companies. \n\nGreenhouse Gases \n\nBurning coal and other fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other gases referred to as greenhouse gases (GHG). Various regulations under the CAA limit CO 2 and other GHG emissions, and in addition, other measures are being imposed or offered by individual states, municipalities and regional agreements with the goal of reducing GHG emissions. \n\nIn July 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule in the Federal Register. This rule contained emission guidelines for GHG emissions from existing electric utility generating units (EGUs) and revisions to emission guideline implementing regulations. The rule defined the \"best system of emission reduction\" (BSER) for GHG emissions from existing coal-fired EGUs as on-site, heat-rate efficiency improvements. In conjunction with the finalization of the ACE rule, the EPA repealed its previously adopted Clean Power Plan (CPP) on the basis that the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority under CAA section 111(d) by defining BSER through generation shifting. A number of states and industry parties filed petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit, challenging the EPA's repeal of the CPP and its enactment of the ACE rule, and in January 2021, the D.C. Circuit issued a decision holding that CAA section 111(d) could be read in a manner that allows the EPA to define BSER as including generation shifting. The D.C. Circuit therefore vacated both the EPA's repeal of the CPP and its replacement of that rule with the ACE rule, and remanded them to the EPA for further consideration. In October 2021, the Supreme Court granted petitions for certiorari to review the D.C. Circuit decision. The Supreme Court issued its decision in June 2022, reversing the D.C. Circuit's decision and holding that, absent specific authorization \n\nfrom Congress, the EPA lacks authority to define BSER through generation shifting. Given that the Supreme Court found the CPP to be unlawful and that the deadlines established in the ACE rule have passed, neither rule is in effect following the Supreme Court's ruling. In January 2023, the EPA announced its intent to propose GHG regulations that would apply to EGUs by April 2023. \n\nDue to uncertainty regarding the future of the EPA's GHG regulations, the Evergy Companies cannot determine the impacts on their operations or consolidated financial results, but the cost to comply with potential GHG rules could be material. \n\nWater \n\nThe Evergy Companies discharge some of the water used in generation and other operations containing substances deemed to be pollutants. A November 2015 EPA rule applicable to steam-electric power generating plants establishes effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) and standards for wastewater discharges, including limits on the amount of toxic metals and other pollutants that can be discharged. Implementation timelines for this 2015 rule vary from 2018 to 2023. In April 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit (5th Circuit) issued a ruling that vacated and remanded portions of the original ELG rule. Due to this ruling, the EPA announced a plan in July 2021 to issue a proposed rule in the fall of 2022 to address the vacated limitations for legacy wastewater and landfill leachate. This proposed rule has not yet been issued and the EPA is now expected to initiate this proposed rulemaking in early 2023. Future ELG modifications for the best available technology economically achievable for the discharge of legacy wastewater and landfill leachate are likely and could be material to the Evergy Companies. \n\nIn October 2020, the EPA published the final ELG reconsideration rule. This rule adjusts numeric limits for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater and adds a 10% volumetric purge limit for bottom ash transport water. The timeline for final FGD wastewater compliance is as soon as possible on or after one year following publication of the final rule in the Federal Register but no later than December 31, 2025. In August 2021, the EPA published notice in the Federal Register that it is initiating a supplemental rulemaking to revise the ELG regulations after completing review of the ELG reconsideration rule as a result of an executive order from President Biden. As part of the rulemaking process, the EPA will determine if more stringent limitations and standards are appropriate. The 2020 ELG reconsideration rule will remain in effect while the EPA undertakes this new rulemaking. \n\nThe Evergy Companies have reviewed the 2020 ELG reconsideration regulation, and the costs to comply with these changes are not expected to be material. However, the Evergy Companies cannot predict what revisions the EPA may make under its supplemental rulemaking to revise the ELG regulations, and compliance costs associated with any revisions could be material. \n\nIn August 2021, based on an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, which vacated and remanded the EPA's 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR), the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that they had halted implementation of the NWPR nationwide, and were interpreting \"Waters of the United States\" consistent with the regulatory regime that was in place prior to 2015. In December 2021, the EPA and the Department of the Army published a proposed rule that would formally repeal the NWPR and revise the definition of \"Waters of the United States\". In December 2022, the EPA and the Department of the Army issued a final rule establishing a definition for \"Waters of the United States\". The final rule was published in the federal register in January 2023 and will take effect in March 2023. The Evergy Companies are reviewing the final rulemaking and the impact on their operations or consolidated financial results are not expected to be material. \n\nRegulation of Coal Combustion Residuals \n\nIn the course of operating their coal generation plants, the Evergy Companies produce coal combustion residuals (CCRs), including fly ash, gypsum and bottom ash. The EPA published a rule to regulate CCRs in April 2015 that requires additional CCR handling, processing and storage equipment and closure of certain ash disposal units. In January 2022, the EPA published proposed determinations for facilities that filed closure extensions for unlined or clay-lined CCR units. These proposed determinations include various interpretations of the CCR regulations and compliance expectations that may impact all owners of CCR units. These interpretations could require modified compliance plans such as different methods of CCR unit closure. Additionally, more stringent remediation requirements for units that are in corrective action or forced to go into corrective action are possible. In April 2022, \n\nthe Utility Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) and other interested parties filed similar petitions in the D.C. Circuit challenging the EPA's legal positions regarding the CCR rule determinations proposed in January 2022. Some CCR units at Lawrence Energy Center and Sibley Station have moved into corrective action. In January 2022, the EPA issued a \"Notice of Potential Violation\" to the Tecumseh Energy Center (TEC) suggesting a closed CCR impoundment should enter corrective action. In November 2022, Evergy agreed to a Consent Agreement and Final Order (CAFO) with the EPA Region 7 addressing the alleged potential violation. In the CAFO, Evergy agreed to re-open the TEC CCR impoundment for further assessment of groundwater. It is possible that the TEC impoundment or other CCR units at other generation stations could move into corrective action based on the EPA CCR rule interpretations, enforcement actions, or execution of the Evergy Companies' CCR strategy. The cost to comply with these proposed determinations by the EPA could be material. \n\nThe Evergy Companies have recorded AROs for their current estimates for the closure of ash disposal ponds and landfills, but the revision of these AROs may be required in the future due to changes in existing CCR regulations, the results of groundwater monitoring of CCR units or changes in interpretation of existing CCR regulations or changes in the timing or cost to close ash disposal ponds and landfills. If revisions to these AROs are necessary, the impact on the Evergy Companies' operations or consolidated financial results could be material. \n\nNuclear Insurance \n\nNuclear liability, property and accidental outage insurance is maintained for Wolf Creek. These policies contain certain industry standard terms, conditions and exclusions, including, but not limited to, ordinary wear and tear and war. An industry aggregate limit of $ 3.2 billion for nuclear events ($ 1.8 billion of non-nuclear events) plus any reinsurance, indemnity or any other source recoverable by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), provider of property and accidental outage insurance, exists for acts of terrorism affecting Wolf Creek or any other NEIL insured plant within 12 months from the date of the first act. In addition, participation is required in industry-wide retrospect assessment programs as discussed below. \n\nNuclear Liability Insurance \n\nPursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, liability insurance includes coverage against public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the required limit of public liability, which is approximately $ 13.7 billion. This limit of liability consists of the maximum available commercial insurance of $ 0.5 billion and the remaining $ 13.2 billion is provided through mandatory participation in an industry-wide retrospective assessment program. Under this retrospective assessment program, the owners of Wolf Creek are jointly and severally subject to an assessment of up to $ 137.6 million (Evergy's share is $ 129.4 million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $ 64.7 million), payable at no more than $ 20.5 million (Evergy's share is $ 19.2 million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $ 9.6 million) per incident per year per reactor for any commercial U.S. nuclear reactor qualifying incident. Both the total and yearly assessment is subject to an inflationary adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index and applicable premium taxes. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose additional revenue-raising measures to pay claims. \n\nNuclear Property and Accidental Outage Insurance \n\nThe owners of Wolf Creek carry decontamination liability, nuclear property damage and premature nuclear decommissioning liability insurance for Wolf Creek totaling approximately $ 2.8 billion. Insurance coverage for non-nuclear property damage accidents total approximately $ 2.3 billion. In the event of an extraordinary nuclear accident, insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination in accordance with a plan mandated by the NRC. The Evergy Companies' share of any remaining proceeds can be used to pay for property damage or, if certain requirements are met, including decommissioning the plant, toward a shortfall in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund. The owners also carry additional insurance with NEIL to help cover costs of replacement power and other extra expenses incurred during a prolonged outage resulting from accidental property damage at Wolf Creek. If significant losses were incurred at any of the nuclear plants insured under the NEIL policies, the owners of Wolf Creek may be subject to retrospective assessments under the current policies of approximately $ 28.3 million (Evergy's share is $ 26.6 million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $ 13.3 million). \n\nNuclear Insurance Considerations \n\nAlthough the Evergy Companies maintain various insurance policies to provide coverage for potential losses and liabilities resulting from an accident or an extended outage, the insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the costs that could result from a catastrophic accident or extended outage at Wolf Creek. Any substantial losses not covered by insurance, to the extent not recoverable in prices, would have a material effect on the Evergy Companies' consolidated financial results. \n\nContractual Commitments - Fuel and Power \n\nThe Evergy Companies' contractual commitments for fuel and power at December 31, 2022 are detailed in the following tables. See Notes 9, 12 and 21 for information regarding pension, long-term debt and lease commitments, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_START Evergy 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027 Total Purchase commitments (millions) Fuel $ 308.6 &#160; $ 157.5 &#160; $ 130.4 &#160; $ 132.9 &#160; $ 57.1 &#160; $ 148.3 &#160; $ 934.8 &#160; Power 62.7 &#160; 57.1 &#160; 57.5 &#160; 57.5 &#160; 57.5 &#160; 275.2 &#160; 567.5 &#160; Total fuel and power commitments $ 371.3 &#160; $ 214.6 &#160; $ 187.9 &#160; $ 190.4 &#160; $ 114.6 &#160; $ 423.5 &#160; $ 1,502.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Evergy Kansas Central 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027 Total Purchase commitments (millions) Fuel $ 160.3 &#160; $ 100.6 &#160; $ 83.9 &#160; $ 83.7 &#160; $ 30.3 &#160; $ 77.9 &#160; $ 536.7 &#160; Power 0.9 &#160; 0.9 &#160; 0.9 &#160; 0.9 &#160; 0.9 &#160; 2.7 &#160; 7.2 &#160; Total fuel and power commitments $ 161.2 &#160; $ 101.5 &#160; $ 84.8 &#160; $ 84.6 &#160; $ 31.2 &#160; $ 80.6 &#160; $ 543.9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Evergy Metro 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027 Total Purchase commitments (millions) Fuel $ 128.2 &#160; $ 49.1 &#160; $ 39.7 &#160; $ 42.3 &#160; $ 22.5 &#160; $ 70.4 &#160; $ 352.2 &#160; Power 35.3 &#160; 29.2 &#160; 29.2 &#160; 29.2 &#160; 29.2 &#160; 166.9 &#160; 319.0 &#160; Total fuel and power commitments $ 163.5 &#160; $ 78.3 &#160; $ 68.9 &#160; $ 71.5 &#160; $ 51.7 &#160; $ 237.3 &#160; $ 671.2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation.

GUARANTEES \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Evergy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes. The majority of these agreements guarantee Evergy's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Evergy has provided $ 804.0 million of credit support for certain of its subsidiaries as follows: \n\n&#8226; Evergy direct guarantees to Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro counterparties for certain fuel supply contracts totaling $ 48.0 million, which expire in 2027; and \n\n&#8226; Evergy's guarantee of Evergy Missouri West long-term debt totaling $ 756.0 million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2043. \n\nEvergy has also guaranteed Evergy Missouri West's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2022, Evergy Missouri West had $ 449.2 million of commercial paper outstanding. None of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings were downgraded. \n\n17.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY \n\nEvergy's authorized capital stock consists of 600 million shares of common stock, without par value, and 12 million shares of Preference Stock, without par value. \n\nBluescape Energy Partners, LLC (Bluescape) Securities Purchase Agreement \n\nIn February 2021, Evergy entered into a securities purchase agreement with an affiliate of Bluescape. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, an affiliate of Bluescape agreed to purchase 2,269,447 shares of Evergy&#8217;s common stock for approximately $ 113.2 million and to receive a warrant to purchase up to 3,950,000 additional shares of Evergy&#8217;s common stock. Under the terms of the warrant, Evergy will have the option to elect a net cash settlement with respect to the exercise of the warrant under certain circumstances, or to net settle in shares of Evergy&#8217;s common stock. The warrant expires three years from issuance and has an exercise price equal to $ 64.70 per share. Following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, Evergy completed the sale of its common stock and warrant to the affiliate of Bluescape in April 2021 for $ 112.5 million, net of issuance costs of $ 0.7 million. The Executive Chairman of Bluescape, C. John Wilder, joined the Evergy Board in March 2021. \n\nEvergy Registration Statements \n\nIn September 2021, Evergy filed an automatic registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which expires in September 2024. \n\nIn September 2021, Evergy registered shares of its common stock with the SEC for its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. Shares issued under the plan may be either newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. \n\nEvergy has registered shares of its common stock with the SEC for the Evergy, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan. Shares issued under the plan may be either newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. \n\nDividend Restrictions \n\nEvergy depends on its subsidiaries to pay dividends on its common stock. The Evergy Companies have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels or the ability to pay dividends. \n\nThe KCC order authorizing the merger transaction requires Evergy to maintain consolidated common equity of at least 35 % of total consolidated capitalization. \n\nUnder the Federal Power Act, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings. Certain conditions in the MPSC and KCC orders authorizing the merger transaction also require Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro to maintain consolidated common equity of at least 40 % of total capitalization. Other conditions in the MPSC and KCC merger orders require Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to maintain credit ratings of at least investment grade. If Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's or Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings are downgraded below the investment grade level as a result of their affiliation with Evergy or any of Evergy's affiliates, the impacted utility shall not pay a dividend to Evergy without KCC or MPSC approval or until the impacted utility's investment grade credit rating has been restored. \n\nThe master credit facility of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West and the note purchase agreements for certain Evergy Missouri West senior notes contain covenants requiring the respective company to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00 at all times. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, all of Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's retained earnings and net income were free of restrictions and Evergy Metro had a retained earnings restriction of $ 222.9 million. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy's subsidiaries had restricted net assets of approximately $ 5.8 billion. These restrictions are not expected to affect the Evergy Companies' ability to pay dividends at the current level for the foreseeable future. \n\n19. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES \n\nIn determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Evergy Companies assess the entity's purpose and design, including the nature of the entity's activities and the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. A reporting enterprise is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. The trust holding Evergy Kansas Central's 50 % interest in La Cygne Unit 2 is a VIE and Evergy Kansas Central remains the primary beneficiary of the trust. \n\nAll involvement with entities by the Evergy Companies is assessed to determine whether such entities are VIEs and, if so, whether or not the Evergy Companies are the primary beneficiaries of the entities. The Evergy Companies also continuously assess whether they are the primary beneficiary of the VIE with which they are involved. Prospective changes in facts and circumstances may cause identification of the primary beneficiary to be reconsidered. \n\n50 % Interest in La Cygne Unit 2 \n\nUnder an agreement that expires in September 2029, Evergy Kansas Central entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a trust under which the trust purchased Evergy Kansas Central's 50 % interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and subsequently leased it back to Evergy Kansas Central. The trust was financed with an equity contribution from \n\nan owner participant and debt issued by the trust. The trust was created specifically to purchase the 50 % interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and lease it back to Evergy Kansas Central and does not hold any other assets. Evergy Kansas Central meets the requirements to be considered the primary beneficiary of the trust. In determining the primary beneficiary of the trust, Evergy Kansas Central concluded that the activities of the trust that most significantly impact its economic performance and that Evergy Kansas Central has the power to direct include (1) the operation and maintenance of the 50 % interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and (2) Evergy Kansas Central's ability to exercise a purchase option at the end of the agreement at the lesser of fair value or a fixed amount. Evergy Kansas Central has the potential to receive benefits from the trust that could potentially be significant if the fair value of the 50 % interest in La Cygne Unit 2 at the end of the agreement is greater than the fixed amount. \n\nThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to the VIE described above that are recorded on Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's consolidated balance sheets. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31 2022 2021 Assets: (millions) Property, plant and equipment of variable interest entities, net $ 140.7 &#160; $ 147.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe assets of the VIE can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and the VIE's debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central. Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central have not provided financial or other support to the VIE and are not required to provide such support. Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central did not record any gain or loss upon the initial consolidation of the VIE. \n\n20.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Evergy Kansas Central had $ 226.9 million and $ 204.7 million, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Evergy Metro had $ 77.6 million and $ 162.1 million, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards. The carryforwards for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro relate primarily to wind production tax credits and research and development tax credits and expire in the years 2023 to 2042. Approximately $ 0.1 million of Evergy's credits are related to Low Income Housing credits that were acquired in Great Plains Energy's acquisition of Evergy Missouri West. \n\nThe year of origin of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's related tax benefit amounts for federal tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2022 are detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Amount of Benefit Year of Origin Evergy Evergy Kansas Central Evergy Metro (millions) 2005 0.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2006 0.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2007 0.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2013 9.1 &#160; 4.3 &#160; 4.8 &#160; 2014 24.1 &#160; 10.8 &#160; 13.0 &#160; 2015 24.7 &#160; 10.9 &#160; 13.2 &#160; 2016 27.1 &#160; 11.0 &#160; 12.4 &#160; 2017 43.9 &#160; 35.0 &#160; 8.3 &#160; 2018 43.9 &#160; 36.3 &#160; 7.5 &#160; 2019 37.7 &#160; 30.8 &#160; 6.7 &#160; 2020 35.9 &#160; 28.4 &#160; 7.4 &#160; 2021 31.9 &#160; 28.1 &#160; 3.7 &#160; 2022 32.4 &#160; 31.3 &#160; 0.6 &#160; $ 311.0 &#160; $ 226.9 &#160; $ 77.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, Evergy had $ 25.4 million and $ 33.6 million, respectively, of tax benefits related to federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. Approximately $ 7.1 million of Evergy's tax benefits at December 31, 2022 are related to NOLs that were acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition. Due to federal limitations on the utilization of income tax attributes acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition, Evergy expects a portion of these federal NOL carryforwards to expire unutilized and has provided a valuation allowance against $ 7.1 million of the federal income tax benefit. The federal NOL carryforwards expire in 2024. \n\nThe year of origin of Evergy's related tax benefit amounts for federal NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2022 are detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Year of Origin Amount of Benefit (millions) 2006 $ 25.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition, Evergy also had deferred tax benefits of $ 6.3 million and $ 6.6 million related to state NOLs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The state NOL carryforwards expire in years 2023 to 2040. Evergy does not expect to utilize $ 5.7 million of NOLs before the expiration date of the carryforwards of NOLs in certain states. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided against $ 5.7 million of state tax benefits. \n\nValuation Allowances \n\nEvergy is required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets using a \"more likely than not\" assessment threshold. This assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within Evergy's control. As a result of this assessment, Evergy has established a partial valuation allowance for federal and state tax NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nEvergy is considered open to U.S. federal examination for years after 2009 due to the carryforward of net operating losses and general business income tax credits. With few exceptions, Evergy is no longer subject to state and local \n\ntax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018. As of December 31, 2022, Evergy does not have any significant income tax issues under examination. \n\n21. LEASES \n\nThe Evergy Companies lease office buildings, computer equipment, vehicles, rail cars, generating plant and other property and equipment, including rail cars to serve jointly-owned generating units where Evergy Kansas Central or Evergy Metro is the managing partner and is reimbursed by other joint-owners for the other owners' proportionate share of the costs. Under GAAP, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Evergy Companies assess a contract as being or containing a lease if the contract identifies property, plant and equipment, provides the lessee the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the property, plant and equipment and provides the lessee the right to direct the use of the property, plant and equipment. \n\nThe Evergy Companies have entered into several agreements to purchase energy through renewable purchase power agreements that are accounted for as leases that commenced prior to the application of Topic 842-Leases . Due to the intermittent nature of renewable generation, these leases have significant variable lease payments not included in the initial and subsequent measurement of the lease liability. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. In addition, certain other contracts contain payment for activity that transfers a separate good or service such as utilities or common area maintenance. The Evergy Companies have elected a practical expedient permitted by GAAP to not separate such components of the lease from other lease components for all leases. \n\nThe Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro leases have remaining terms ranging from 1 to 16 years, 1 to 16 years and 1 to 10 years, respectively. Leases that have original lease terms of twelve months or less are not recognized on the Evergy Companies&#8217; balance sheets. Some leases have options to renew the lease or terminate early at the election of the Evergy Companies. Judgment is applied at lease commencement to determine the reasonably certain lease term based on then-current assumptions about use of the leased asset, market conditions and terms in the contract. The judgment applied to determine the lease term can significantly impact the measurement of the lease liability and right-of-use asset and lease classification. \n\nThe Evergy Companies typically discount lease payments over the term of the lease using their incremental borrowing rates at lease commencement to measure its initial and subsequent lease liability. For leases that existed at the initial application of Topic 842, the Evergy Companies used the incremental borrowing rates that corresponded to the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019. \n\nLeases may be classified as either operating leases or finance leases. The lease classification is based on assumptions of the lease term and discount rate, as discussed above, and the fair market value and economic life of the leased asset. Operating leases recognize a consistent expense each period over the lease term, while finance leases will result in the separate presentation of interest expense on the lease liability and amortization of the right-of-use asset. Finance leases are treated as operating leases for rate-making purposes and as such, the Evergy Companies defer to a regulatory asset or liability any material differences between expense recognition and the timing of payments in order to match what is being recovered in customer rates. \n\nThe Evergy Companies' lease expense is detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Evergy 2022 2021 2020 Finance lease costs (millions) Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 5.3 &#160; $ 5.1 &#160; $ 7.7 &#160; Interest on lease liabilities 2.4 &#160; 2.5 &#160; 3.1 &#160; Operating lease costs 21.9 &#160; 21.8 &#160; 22.9 &#160; Short-term lease costs 4.9 &#160; 5.9 &#160; 2.1 &#160; Variable lease costs for renewable purchase power agreements 318.0 &#160; 280.3 &#160; 296.6 &#160; Total lease costs $ 352.5 &#160; $ 315.6 &#160; $ 332.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Evergy Kansas Central 2022 2021 2020 Finance lease costs (millions) Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 4.7 &#160; $ 4.5 &#160; $ 7.2 &#160; Interest on lease liabilities 2.2 &#160; 2.4 &#160; 2.8 &#160; Operating lease costs 12.1 &#160; 12.9 &#160; 11.9 &#160; Short-term lease costs 1.4 &#160; 1.8 &#160; 0.5 &#160; Variable lease costs for renewable purchase power agreements 155.2 &#160; 145.8 &#160; 135.6 &#160; Total lease costs $ 175.6 &#160; $ 167.4 &#160; $ 158.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Evergy Metro 2022 2021 2020 Finance lease costs (millions) Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 0.5 &#160; $ 0.4 &#160; $ 0.3 &#160; Interest on lease liabilities 0.1 &#160; 0.1 &#160; 0.1 &#160; Operating lease costs 8.7 &#160; 9.0 &#160; 9.3 &#160; Short-term lease costs 3.3 &#160; 3.0 &#160; 1.5 &#160; Variable lease costs for renewable purchase power agreements 122.6 &#160; 101.0 &#160; 112.2 &#160; Total lease costs $ 135.2 &#160; $ 113.5 &#160; $ 123.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to the Evergy Companies' leases is detailed in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START Evergy 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: (millions) Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 21.1 &#160; $ 20.7 &#160; $ 22.2 &#160; Operating cash flows from finance leases 2.4 &#160; 2.6 &#160; 2.8 &#160; Financing cash flows from finance leases 5.9 &#160; 5.3 &#160; 5.6 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 12.2 &#160; 16.4 &#160; 6.9 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities 7.0 &#160; 1.4 &#160; 5.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Evergy Kansas Central 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: (millions) Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 11.4 &#160; $ 11.8 &#160; $ 12.9 &#160; Operating cash flows from finance leases 2.2 &#160; 2.4 &#160; 2.5 &#160; Financing cash flows from finance leases 5.1 &#160; 4.7 &#160; 5.1 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 12.0 &#160; 7.1 &#160; 6.6 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities 7.0 &#160; 1.4 &#160; 4.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Evergy Metro 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: (millions) Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 9.3 &#160; $ 10.4 &#160; $ 10.8 &#160; Operating cash flows from finance leases 0.1 &#160; 0.1 &#160; 0.1 &#160; Financing cash flows from finance leases 0.7 &#160; 0.5 &#160; 0.4 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 0.2 &#160; 9.3 &#160; 0.3 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFinance Leases \n\nRight-of-use assets for finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment on the Evergy Companies' balance sheets.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEVERGY \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nEvergy carried out an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). This evaluation was conducted under the supervision, and with the participation, of Evergy's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and Evergy's disclosure committee. Based upon this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Evergy have concluded as of the end of the period covered by this report that the disclosure controls and procedures of Evergy were effective at a reasonable assurance level. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere has been no change in Evergy&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly period ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. \n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for Evergy. Under the supervision and with the \n\nparticipation of Evergy&#8217;s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, management evaluated the effectiveness of Evergy&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management used for this evaluation the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. \n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nManagement has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, Evergy&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria set forth in the COSO framework. Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, has issued its attestation report on Evergy&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, which is included below. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Evergy, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Evergy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nKansas City, Missouri \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nEVERGY KANSAS CENTRAL \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nEvergy Kansas Central carried out an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
